303 As part of the JMC build, the JMC update sites will be built. 
304 
305 There is one update site for the stand-alone RCP application, providing plug-ins for the stand-alone release of JMC:
306 
307 ```bash
308 application/org.openjdk.jmc.updatesite.rcp/target/
309 ```
310 
311 There is another update site for the Eclipse plug-ins, providing plug-ins for running JMC inside of Eclipse:
312 
313 ```bash
314 application/org.openjdk.jmc.updatesite.ide/target/
315 ```
316 
317 To install it into Eclipe, simply open Eclipse and select Help | Install New Software... In the dialog, click Add... and then click the Archive... button. Select the built update site, e.g. 
318 
319 ```bash
320 application/org.openjdk.jmc.updatesite.ide/target/org.openjdk.jmc.updatesite.ide-8.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip
321 ```

<span class="line-modified">323 ## Setting Up for Development and Launching in Eclipse</span>
<span class="line-modified">324 First make sure that you have a recent version of Eclipse. An Eclipse 2018-09 with the JDK 11 plug-in installed (available from Eclipse Marketplace) will do. You may also want to install the Mercurial Plug-in for Eclipse (MercurialEclipse). The Eclipse Marketplace is available under **Help | Eclipse Marketplace...**.</span>
<span class="line-removed">325 </span>
<span class="line-removed">326 To set Eclipse up for JMC development, do the following:</span>
<span class="line-removed">327 </span>
<span class="line-removed">328 1. First ensure that you have started the jetty server in the first step of building JMC.</span>
<span class="line-removed">329 2. Next open (File | Open...) the Eclipse target platform of interest, for example releng/platform-definitions/platform-definition-photon/platform.target</span>
<span class="line-removed">330 3. In the upper right corner of the platform editor that opens, click the link &quot;Set as Active Target Platform&quot;</span>
<span class="line-removed">331 4. Import the projects you are interested in (core and/or application) into a recent Eclipse.</span>
<span class="line-removed">332 5. If importing the application projects, make sure you create a user library (Preferences | Java/Build Path/User Libraries) named JMC_JDK, and add (Add External JARs...) the following JARs from a JDK 8 (u40 or above) to the User Library:</span>
<span class="line-removed">333  - tools.jar (&lt;JDK&gt;/lib/tools.jar)</span>
<span class="line-removed">334  - jconsole.jar (&lt;JDK&gt;/lib/jconsole.jar)</span>
<span class="line-removed">335  - jfxswt.jar (&lt;JDK&gt;/jre/lib/jfxswt.jar)</span>
<span class="line-removed">336  - jfxrt.jar (&lt;JDK&gt;/jre/lib/ext/jfxrt.jar)</span>
<span class="line-removed">337 </span>
<span class="line-removed">338 Note that importing configuration/ide/eclipse as an Eclipse project should automatically make the development launchers available to you.</span>
