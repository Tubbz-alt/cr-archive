  LowOnPhysicalMemoryFactory_TEXT_INFO=The maximum amount of used memory was {0} of the physical memory available.
  # {0} is a size in bytes, {1} is a percentage, {2} is a size in bytes
  LowOnPhysicalMemoryFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=The maximum amount of memory used was {0}. This is {1} of the {2} of physical memory available. Having little free memory may lead to swapping, which is very expensive. To avoid this, either decrease the memory usage or increase the amount of available memory.
  LowOnPhysicalMemoryFactory_TEXT_OK=The system did not run low on physical memory during this recording.
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ LuceneVersionRule_LONG_DESCRIPTION_LUCENE=Older versions of Apache Lucene unnecessarily create new LookaheadSuccess error instances for each query parser. This causes additional work to unroll the stack and slows down application performance. The issue was fixed in Lucene 7.1.0.</span>

  ManagementAgentRule_TEXT_INFO=Management agent settings (port, authentication and/or SSL) were changed during runtime.
  ManagementAgentRule_TEXT_INFO_LONG=Management agent settings (port, authentication and/or SSL) were changed during runtime, this is not likely to have had any effect, but could be useful to investigate.
  ManagmentAgentRuleFactory_RULE_NAME=Discouraged Management Agent Settings
  ManagmentAgentRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_SSL_DISABLED=Insecure management agent settings: SSL disabled.
  ManagmentAgentRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_SSL_DISABLED_LONG=The runtime management agent settings were insecure. SSL/TLS was disabled. This is discouraged in production systems, since the traffic will not be secure.
