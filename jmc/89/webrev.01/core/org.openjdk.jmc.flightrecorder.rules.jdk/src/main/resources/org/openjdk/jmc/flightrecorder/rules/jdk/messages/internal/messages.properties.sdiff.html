395 JavaBlockingRule_TEXT_MOST_BLOCKED_CLASS=The most blocking monitor class was &#39;&#39;{0}&#39;&#39;, which was blocked {1} times for a total of {2}.
396 # {0} is a thread name, {1} is a number, {2} is a time period
397 JavaBlockingRule_TEXT_MOST_BLOCKED_THREAD=The most blocking thread was &#39;&#39;{0}&#39;&#39;, which was blocked {1} times for a total of {2}.
398 JavaBlockingRule_TEXT_OK=No problems with lock contention were found.
399 LongGcPauseRuleFactory_RULE_NAME=GC Pause Peak Duration
400 # {0} is a time period
401 LongGcPauseRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO=The longest GC pause was {0}.
402 LongGcPauseRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_G1=You may want to use the G1 garbage collector which is built to reduce garbage collector pauses. To enable G1, add &#39;-XX:+UseG1GC&#39; to the command line.
403 # {0} is a size in bytes, {1} is a size in bytes
404 LongGcPauseRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_MX=The application ran with a live set of {0} and a heap size of {1}. Decreasing the heap size may decrease the garbage collection pause times.
405 LongGcPauseRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_REFERENCES=Processing reference objects was a considerable part of the garbage collector pauses. You may be able to decrease this by reducing the amount of references or by enabling parallel reference processing with &#39;-XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled&#39;.
406 LongGcPauseRuleFactory_TEXT_OK=The application did not cause any long GC pause times.
407 LongGcPauseRule_CONFIG_INFO_LIMIT=GC pause warning limit
408 LongGcPauseRule_CONFIG_INFO_LIMIT_LONG=The GC pause time needed to trigger a warning
409 LowOnPhysicalMemoryFactory_RULE_NAME=Free Physical Memory
410 # {0} is a percentage
411 LowOnPhysicalMemoryFactory_TEXT_INFO=The maximum amount of used memory was {0} of the physical memory available.
412 # {0} is a size in bytes, {1} is a percentage, {2} is a size in bytes
413 LowOnPhysicalMemoryFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=The maximum amount of memory used was {0}. This is {1} of the {2} of physical memory available. Having little free memory may lead to swapping, which is very expensive. To avoid this, either decrease the memory usage or increase the amount of available memory.
414 LowOnPhysicalMemoryFactory_TEXT_OK=The system did not run low on physical memory during this recording.











415 ManagementAgentRule_TEXT_INFO=Management agent settings (port, authentication and/or SSL) were changed during runtime.
416 ManagementAgentRule_TEXT_INFO_LONG=Management agent settings (port, authentication and/or SSL) were changed during runtime, this is not likely to have had any effect, but could be useful to investigate.
417 ManagmentAgentRuleFactory_RULE_NAME=Discouraged Management Agent Settings
418 ManagmentAgentRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_SSL_DISABLED=Insecure management agent settings: SSL disabled.
419 ManagmentAgentRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_SSL_DISABLED_LONG=The runtime management agent settings were insecure. SSL/TLS was disabled. This is discouraged in production systems, since the traffic will not be secure.
420 ManagmentAgentRuleFactory_TEXT_OK=No problems were found with the management agent settings.
421 ManagmentAgentRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN_AUTH_DISABLED=Insecure management agent settings: Password authentication disabled.
422 ManagmentAgentRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN_AUTH_DISABLED_LONG=The runtime management agent settings were insecure. Password authentication was disabled. A remote user who knows (or guesses) the port number and host name will be able to monitor and control the Java application and platform. This is highly discouraged for production systems.
423 ManagmentAgentRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN_BOTH_DISABLED=Insecure management agent settings: Both password authentication and SSL were disabled.
424 ManagmentAgentRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN_BOTH_DISABLED_LONG=The runtime management agent settings were insecure. Both password authentication and SSL were disabled. A remote user who knows (or guesses) the port number and host name will be able to monitor and control the Java application and platform. This is highly discouraged for production systems.
425 ManagmentAgentRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN_CONFIGURE_GUIDE=See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html&quot;&gt;Java Monitoring and Management Guide&lt;/a&gt; for more information about how to configure the management agent.
426 ManyRunningProcessesRule_RULE_NAME=Competing Processes
427 # {0} is a number, {1} is a time stamp
428 ManyRunningProcessesRule_TEXT_INFO={0} processes were running while this Flight Recording was made.
429 # {0} is a number, {1} is a time stamp
430 ManyRunningProcessesRule_TEXT_INFO_LONG=At {1}, a total of {0} other processes were running on the host machine that this Flight Recording was made on.
431 ManyRunningProcessesRule_TEXT_RECOMMENDATION=If this is a server environment, it may be good to only run other critical processes on that machine.
432 ManyRunningProcessesRule_INFO_LIMIT=Competing processes limit
433 ManyRunningProcessesRule_INFO_LIMIT_LONG=The number of simultaneous processes needed to trigger an info notice
434 MetaspaceOomRuleFactory_RULE_NAME=Metaspace Out of Memory
