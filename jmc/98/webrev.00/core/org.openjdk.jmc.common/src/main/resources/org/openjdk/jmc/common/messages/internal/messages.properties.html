104 # Spelled out names of units, within a given kind of quantity (a subset of the &quot;content types&quot; above).
105 # Note that unit names are not required. The names of units are only used for two purposes:
106 # 1) In unit descriptions when selecting a unit.
107 # 2) To match against for content assist (type completion) when editing a value of this kind of quantity.
108 #
109 # If a unit name is not defined for a given unit, but the unit is a prefixed unit and the base (or &quot;atom&quot;)
110 # unit has a name, a unit name is constructed (currently) by concatenating the names or the prefix and
111 # the &quot;atom&quot; unit. If no name can be constructed for a unit, no spelled out name will be included in
112 # the unit description and content assist will only match against the unit symbol. A unit can explicitly
113 # be unnamed by setting the name to an empty string.
114 #
115 # Also, the actual symbols used to display and edit values can be overridden, but this should be used very
116 # sparingly. There are only two known use cases:
117 # 1) The year has a standardized symbol &quot;a&quot;, for the latin &quot;annum&quot;, in the persisting convention we use (UCUM),
118 # but &quot;y&quot; is used elsewhere and is likely more understandable for English speakers.
119 # 2) Languages like French use the (arguably more correct) unit &quot;octet&quot; with symbol &quot;o&quot;, instead of &quot;byte&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.
120 #
121 # When overridden, content assist will also match against the original identifier.
