 29 The timing for creating a changeset is important. Creating the changeset long
 30 before it gets pushed into the parent repository may require complex merges. If
 31 a changeset is created before sufficient review or testing, a rollback may be
 32 required and a new changeset may be required to correct previous mistakes. The
 33 [mq extension](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch12.html#x16-26500012) is
 34 recommended for managing changes before they become
 35 committed to a changeset.
 36 
 37 In the examples below, the script
 38 `common/bin/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply the
 39 Mercurial command to all the repositories in the forest. So when you see
 40 _**`hg`**_, if you are dealing with one repository, just use
 41 &quot;`hg`&quot;, if it&#39;s a forest, use &quot;`sh common/bin/hgforest.sh`&quot;.
 42 
 43 
 44 Each repository in the forest is managed independently. After editing files in
 45 the individual cloned repositories of the forest, the `hg
 46 status` command may be used to see the changes in a single
 47 repository.
 48 
<span class="line-modified"> 49 &gt;     $ hg root</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 50 &gt;     /u/iris/sandbox/box</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 51 &gt;     $ hg status</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 52 &gt;     ? duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 53 &gt;     $ hg add duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 54 &gt;     $ hg status</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 55 &gt;     A duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png</span>
 56 
 57 To see changes made to the repositories use _**`hg`**_ `status`:
 58 
<span class="line-modified"> 59 &gt;     $ hg status</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 60 &gt;     [.]</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 61 &gt;     A duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png</span>
 62 
 63 In this example, the repository was previously cloned as described in
 64 [Cloning a Sandbox Repository](repositories.html#cloneSandbox). A new file
 65 `DukeTubbingSmall.png` was added to a new subdirectory.
 66 
 67 #### Formatting a Changeset Comment
 68 
 69 A single change is described by a block of text of the following form:
 70 
<span class="line-modified"> 71 &gt;     &lt;bugid&gt;: &lt;synopsis-of-symptom&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 72 &gt;     Summary: &lt;summary-of-code-change&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 73 &gt;     Reviewed-by: &lt;reviewer&gt;+</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 74 &gt;     Contributed-by: &lt;contributor-email&gt;</span>
 75 
 76 There may be more than one _bugid_ line, but there
 77 must be at least one.
 78 
 79 The _summary_ line is optional, but authors are
 80 strongly encouraged to include one if the nature of the change is not obvious
 81 from the synopsis. It&#39;s just one line, meant to give the reader a clue as to
 82 how the code changed. A more complete description of the change belongs in the
 83 bug report.
 84 
 85 A _reviewed-by_ line is required. Reviewers must have
 86 the ability to deal with any adverse consequences of the change, and so must
 87 themselves be authors. They are therefore identified by their OpenJDK usernames
 88 rather than full e-mail addresses.
 89 
 90 The _contributed-by_ line is optional. If present, it
 91 is a list of comma-separated email addresses. It should be included only when
 92 the author or authors of the change do not have commit rights to the target
 93 repository and thus would not otherwise receive acknowledgment.
 94 
 95 There will be exceptions for merge changesets, tag changesets, etc.
 96 
 97 Example:
 98 
<span class="line-modified"> 99 &gt;     1234567: NPE thrown on FileInputStream(&quot;&quot;)</span>
<span class="line-modified">100 &gt;     Summary: Rewrite precondition-checking code in io.c</span>
<span class="line-modified">101 &gt;     Reviewed-by: mr</span>
<span class="line-modified">102 &gt;     Contributed-by: Ben Bitdiddle &lt;ben at bits.org&gt;</span>
103 
104 If a changeset contains multiple unrelated changes (this is frowned upon, but
105 may happen from time to time) then its comment will contain multiple blocks of
106 the above form, separated by blank lines.
107 
108 The required format of the comments will be enforced whenever the changeset is
109 pushed into the JDK master or team repository forests. Other Projects may copy
110 these conventions, adopt some other conventions, or have no conventions,
111 depending upon their goals.
112 
113 #### Committing a Changeset
114 
115 The following commands commit all of the changes in a repository to a
116 changeset.
117 
<span class="line-modified">118 &gt;     $ cat ../message</span>
<span class="line-modified">119 &gt;     1111111: Missing Duke gif</span>
<span class="line-modified">120 &gt;     Summary:  Add missing file</span>
<span class="line-modified">121 &gt;     Reviewed-by: iag</span>
<span class="line-modified">122 &gt;     $ hg commit -l ../message</span>
<span class="line-modified">123 &gt;     $ hg toutgoing</span>
<span class="line-modified">124 &gt;     [.]</span>

132 
133 ## Merging
134 
135 It is often necessary to merge local changes with those made in the parent
136 repositories. The first step in a merge process is to retrieve (or pull) the
137 collection of changesets which have been pushed since the last merge or initial
138 clone. If there if there are merge conflicts, then they must be resolved.
139 [Chapter 3](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch3.html#x7-530003) of
140 the Mercurial book contains detailed information on the
141 merging process.
142 
143 There are two basic ways to update the working set files in the repositories:
144 
145 Option 1: _**`hg`**_ `pull`
146 
147 &gt; One way to merge the parent repository with the working set of files is to use
148 &gt; _**`hg`**_ `pull` all by itself. This option allows merging off-line or at a
149 &gt; later time.
150 &gt;
<span class="line-modified">151 &gt;&gt;     $ hg pull</span>
<span class="line-modified">152 &gt;&gt;     [.]</span>
<span class="line-modified">153 &gt;&gt;     pulling from http://hg.openjdk.java.net/sandbox/box</span>
<span class="line-modified">154 &gt;&gt;     searching for changes</span>
<span class="line-modified">155 &gt;&gt;     no changes found</span>
156 &gt;
157 &gt; In Mercurial, pulling changesets will not update or merge into the working set
158 &gt; of files. To update the clone, run _**`hg`**_ `update`. If the update
159 &gt; reports conflicts, run _**`hg`**_ `merge` to resolve them.
160 
161 Option 2: _**`hg`**_ `fetch`
162 
163 &gt; Alternatively, use _**`hg`**_ `fetch` to pull the changes, update the
164 &gt; working set files, and create simple merge changesets as necessary. The
165 &gt; fetch extension is distributed with Mercurial but needs to be enabled. Edit
166 &gt; the `.hgrc` to include the following entries:
167 &gt;
<span class="line-modified">168 &gt;&gt;     [extensions]</span>
<span class="line-modified">169 &gt;&gt;     fetch=</span>
170 &gt;
171 &gt; Once the fetch extension has been enabled, _**`hg`**_ `fetch` may be invoked as follows:
172 &gt;
<span class="line-modified">173 &gt;&gt;     $ hg fetch</span>
<span class="line-modified">174 &gt;&gt;     [.]</span>
<span class="line-modified">175 &gt;&gt;     pulling from http://hg.openjdk.java.net/sandbox/box</span>
<span class="line-modified">176 &gt;&gt;     searching for changes</span>
<span class="line-modified">177 &gt;&gt;     no changes found</span>
178 
179 &gt; ---
180 &gt; Actual file merging will be done with the selected Mercurial merging tool see
181 &gt; [MergeProgram](https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MergeProgram)
182 &gt; for the details on how to define the selected merge tool in ` ~/.hgrc`.
183 
184 &gt; ---
185 
186 ## Pushing
187 
188 In order to push changesets into the parent repository, some additional
189 configuration is required. The following sections describe the operations that
190 will be performed by users with push access.
191 
192 #### Generating an SSH Key
193 
194 All pushes require an ssh key which must be installed on the Mercurial server.
195 The `ssh-keygen` command generates an ssh key. The
196 `-b` option overrides the default number of bits
197 for the key. Allow a few minutes to generate a 4096 bit key; a key of at least
198 2048 bits is recommended. While it is possible to use ssh without a passphrase,
199 this is **strongly** discouraged. Empty or
200 insecure passphrases may be reset using `ssh-keygen
201 -p`; this does not change the keys.
202 
<span class="line-modified">203 &gt;     $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096</span>
<span class="line-modified">204 &gt;     Enter file in which to save the key(/u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa):</span>
<span class="line-modified">205 &gt;     Generating public/private rsa key pair.</span>
<span class="line-modified">206 &gt;     Enter passphrase(empty for no passphrase):</span>
<span class="line-modified">207 &gt;     Enter same passphrase again:</span>
<span class="line-modified">208 &gt;     Your identification has been saved in /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa.</span>
<span class="line-modified">209 &gt;     Your public key has been saved in /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.</span>
<span class="line-modified">210 &gt;     The key fingerprint is:</span>
<span class="line-modified">211 &gt;     md5 4096 c2:b7:00:e6:4b:da:ea:ec:32:30:f5:bd:12:26:04:83 iris@duke</span>
<span class="line-modified">212 &gt;     The key&#39;s randomart image is:</span>
<span class="line-modified">213 &gt;     +--[ RSA 4096]----+</span>
<span class="line-modified">214 &gt;     |    E.=          |</span>
<span class="line-modified">215 &gt;     |     . *         |</span>
<span class="line-modified">216 &gt;     |      o .   .    |</span>
<span class="line-modified">217 &gt;     |         + o     |</span>
<span class="line-modified">218 &gt;     |        S + .    |</span>
<span class="line-modified">219 &gt;     |       .   + .   |</span>
<span class="line-modified">220 &gt;     |        + + +..  |</span>
<span class="line-modified">221 &gt;     |       * . oo+.  |</span>
<span class="line-modified">222 &gt;     |      o . .o..   |</span>
<span class="line-modified">223 &gt;     +-----------------+</span>
224 
225 The `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` is a text file
226 containing the public ssh key. This file should be mailed as an attachment
227 along with the JDK username to
228 [keys(at)openjdk.java.net](mailto:keys-at-openjdk.java.net).
229 An administrator will install your key on the server and notify you on
230 completion. This process may take a couple of days.
231 
232 &gt; ---
233 &gt; Users behind a SOCKS firewall can add a directive to the
234 &gt; `~/.ssh/config` file to connect to the OpenJDK
235 &gt; Mercurial server:
236 &gt; 
<span class="line-modified">237 &gt;&gt;     Host *.openjdk.java.net</span>
<span class="line-modified">238 &gt;&gt;     ProxyCommand /usr/lib/ssh/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect -h [socks_proxy_address] %h %p</span>
239 &gt;
240 &gt; See the `ssh-socks5-proxy-connect` man page and
241 &gt; `ssh-config` man page for more information. Other
242 &gt; systems may require proxy access via other programs. Some Linux distributions
243 &gt; provide the `corkscrew` package which provides ssh
244 &gt; access through HTTP proxies.
245 &gt; 
246 &gt; **It is recommended that all users check with their network
247 &gt; administrators before installing any kind of TCP forwarding tool on their
248 &gt; network. Many corporations and institutions have strict security policies in
249 &gt; this area.**
250 
251 &gt; ---
252 
253 #### SSH Shortcuts
254 
255 The following section provides some tips for improving the usability of
256 ssh-related operations.
257 
258 * _Using SSH in multiple shells_
259 
260   To avoid having to constantly type in the passphrase, use the ssh-agent on your
261   local client to cache your pashphrase:
262 
<span class="line-modified">263   &gt;     $ eval `ssh-agent`</span>
<span class="line-modified">264   &gt;     Agent pid 17450</span>
<span class="line-modified">265   &gt;     $ ssh-add</span>
<span class="line-modified">266   &gt;     Enter passphrase for /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa:</span>
<span class="line-modified">267   &gt;     Identity added: /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa(/u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa)</span>
268 
269   The same ssh-agent process can be shared with multiple shells. There are
270   various ways to do this. Bash users can accomplish this with the following code
271   in `.bashrc`:
272 
<span class="line-modified">273   &gt;     if [ &quot;$PS1&quot; -a -d $HOME/.ssh ]; then</span>
<span class="line-modified">274   &gt;       if [ &quot;x$SSH_AUTH_SOCK&quot; = x ]; then</span>
<span class="line-modified">275   &gt;         eval `ssh-agent | grep -v &#39;echo Agent pid&#39;`</span>
<span class="line-modified">276   &gt;         ssh-add</span>
<span class="line-modified">277   &gt;         trap &quot;echo Killing SSH agent $SSH_AGENT_PID; kill $SSH_AGENT_PID&quot; 0</span>
<span class="line-modified">278   &gt;       fi</span>
<span class="line-modified">279   &gt;     fi</span>
280 
281   For secure operation, only start an ssh-agent when needed and kill it off when
282   the shell completes. Test this by running `ssh &#39;hostname&#39; echo
283   hello` multiple times.
284 
285 * _Logging in without a password_
286 
287   To avoid needing to constantly type in the password, add the public key to the
288   list of ssh authorized keys.
289 
<span class="line-modified">290   &gt;     $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</span>
<span class="line-modified">291   &gt;     $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</span>
292 
293 #### Setting the `default-push` Path to the Server Repositories
294 
295 &lt;!-- 
296 #. Option 1: Add default-push path to every &lt;code&gt;.hg/hgrc&lt;/code&gt;
297 --&gt;
298 
299 This is the typical development model:
300 
301 :::{style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;}
302 ![Diagram of server repos and user&#39;s clone](devModel.gif)
303 :::
304 
305 Changesets need to be _pushed_ via ssh to the
306 read/write repository which resides on the OpenJDK Mercurial server. The
307 easiest way to do this is to have each repository define the &quot;default-push&quot;
308 path in every repository&#39;s `.hg/hgrc` file. The
309 `.hg/hgrc` file in is not a managed file - it is
310 private to the repository. The following example defines the &quot;default&quot; and
311 &quot;default-push&quot; paths for clones of the jdk9/dev team repository.
312 
<span class="line-modified">313 &gt;     [paths]</span>
<span class="line-modified">314 &gt;     default = http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev</span>
<span class="line-modified">315 &gt;     default-push = ssh://&lt;JDK_username&gt;@hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev</span>
316 
317 Given a `JDK_username` this simple script will
318 attempt to do this for all the repositories:
319 
<span class="line-modified">320 &gt;     #!/bin/sh</span>
<span class="line-modified">321 &gt;     username=$1</span>
<span class="line-modified">322 &gt;     hgdirs=&quot;`find . -type d -name .hg`&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">323 &gt;     for i in ${hgdirs}; do</span>
<span class="line-modified">324 &gt;       d=&quot;`dirname ${i}`&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">325 &gt;       defpush=&quot;`(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths default-push 2&gt; /dev/null)`&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">326 &gt;       if [ &quot;${defpush}&quot; = &quot;&quot; ] ; then</span>
<span class="line-modified">327 &gt;         defpath=&quot;`(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths default 2&gt; /dev/null)`&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">328 &gt;         if [ &quot;${defpath}&quot; != &quot;&quot; ] ; then</span>
<span class="line-modified">329 &gt;           defpush=&quot;`echo ${defpath} | sed -e &#39;s@http://\([^/]*/[^/]*/[^/]*\)/\(.*\)@ssh://$username\@\1/\2@&#39;`&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">330 &gt;           cp ${i}/hgrc ${i}/hgrc.orig</span>
<span class="line-modified">331 &gt;           echo &quot;default-push = ${defpush}&quot; &gt;&gt; ${i}/hgrc</span>
<span class="line-modified">332 &gt;           echo &quot;Added default-push: ${defpush}&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">333 &gt;         fi</span>
<span class="line-modified">334 &gt;       fi</span>
<span class="line-modified">335 &gt;     done</span>
<span class="line-modified">336 &gt;     for i in ${hgdirs}; do</span>
<span class="line-modified">337 &gt;       d=&quot;`dirname ${i}`&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">338 &gt;       echo &quot;(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths)&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">339 &gt;       (cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths)</span>
<span class="line-modified">340 &gt;     done</span>
<span class="line-modified">341 &gt;     exit 0</span>
342 
343 &lt;!--
344 #. Option 2: Use the &lt;code&gt;defpath&lt;/code&gt; ExtensionAnother way to setup the default-push path is to use the Mercurial defpath
345     extension, which is available in /java/jdk/lib/hgext/defpath.py. To enable
346     this extension add the following to the &lt;code&gt;~/hgrc&lt;/code&gt; file:
347 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
348 [extensions]
349 defpath = /java/jdk/lib/hgext/defpath.py  # Or the pathname of a local copy
350 &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
351      The defpath extension actually adds two new Mercurial subcommands:
352     defpath to operate upon a single repository and fdefpath for an entire
353     forest. hg help defpath or hg help fdefpath will tell you more. For a
354     freshly cloned open/closed forest the command you probably want is
355 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
356 $ hg fdefpath -dgv
357 &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
358      Be sure to try this with the -n flag first to see if it will do what
359     you actually expect. If your OpenJDK username differs from your Oracle
360     username then add -u name to the command line.
361      The defpath extension defines the default-push path, which is the path
362     that Mercurial uses by default in push operations.
363 --&gt;
364 
365 #### Pushing a Changeset
366 
367 [Committers](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer)
368 can use the _**hg**_ `push` command to propagate changesets into the repositories.
369 
370 Most developers will only find a need to create changesets in one or two
371 repositories. However, it is important that before any changesets are pushed,
372 the corresponding forest pull and merge with the destination forest be
373 performed; otherwise there is a risk of breaking the build.
374 
<span class="line-modified">375 &gt;     $ hg push</span>
376 
377 After the push has been accepted, an automatic e-mail notification will be sent
378 to the [mailing list](https://mail.openjdk.java.net) associated with the
379 repository. In most cases notifications
380 are sent to the Project&#39;s _-dev_ mailing list. Some
381 Projects with high traffic _-dev_ mailing lists use a
382 dedicated _-changes_ list for notifications.
383 
384 &gt; ---
385 &gt; Who has push access?
386 &gt;
387 &gt; All of a Project&#39;s [Committers](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer)
388 &gt; can push to all of the the Project&#39;s repositories.
389 &gt;
390 &gt; Some Projects may chose to restrict the set of Committers with push to key
391 &gt; repositories. For instance, JDK Release Projects restrict push access to MASTER
392 &gt; repositories to Committers who are either integrators or members of the Release
393 &gt; Engineering Team.

 29 The timing for creating a changeset is important. Creating the changeset long
 30 before it gets pushed into the parent repository may require complex merges. If
 31 a changeset is created before sufficient review or testing, a rollback may be
 32 required and a new changeset may be required to correct previous mistakes. The
 33 [mq extension](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch12.html#x16-26500012) is
 34 recommended for managing changes before they become
 35 committed to a changeset.
 36 
 37 In the examples below, the script
 38 `common/bin/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply the
 39 Mercurial command to all the repositories in the forest. So when you see
 40 _**`hg`**_, if you are dealing with one repository, just use
 41 &quot;`hg`&quot;, if it&#39;s a forest, use &quot;`sh common/bin/hgforest.sh`&quot;.
 42 
 43 
 44 Each repository in the forest is managed independently. After editing files in
 45 the individual cloned repositories of the forest, the `hg
 46 status` command may be used to see the changes in a single
 47 repository.
 48 
<span class="line-modified"> 49     $ hg root</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 50     /u/iris/sandbox/box</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 51     $ hg status</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 52     ? duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 53     $ hg add duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 54     $ hg status</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 55     A duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png</span>
 56 
 57 To see changes made to the repositories use _**`hg`**_ `status`:
 58 
<span class="line-modified"> 59     $ hg status</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 60     [.]</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 61     A duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png</span>
 62 
 63 In this example, the repository was previously cloned as described in
 64 [Cloning a Sandbox Repository](repositories.html#cloneSandbox). A new file
 65 `DukeTubbingSmall.png` was added to a new subdirectory.
 66 
 67 #### Formatting a Changeset Comment
 68 
 69 A single change is described by a block of text of the following form:
 70 
<span class="line-modified"> 71     &lt;bugid&gt;: &lt;synopsis-of-symptom&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 72     Summary: &lt;summary-of-code-change&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 73     Reviewed-by: &lt;reviewer&gt;+</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 74     Contributed-by: &lt;contributor-email&gt;</span>
 75 
 76 There may be more than one _bugid_ line, but there
 77 must be at least one.
 78 
 79 The _summary_ line is optional, but authors are
 80 strongly encouraged to include one if the nature of the change is not obvious
 81 from the synopsis. It&#39;s just one line, meant to give the reader a clue as to
 82 how the code changed. A more complete description of the change belongs in the
 83 bug report.
 84 
 85 A _reviewed-by_ line is required. Reviewers must have
 86 the ability to deal with any adverse consequences of the change, and so must
 87 themselves be authors. They are therefore identified by their OpenJDK usernames
 88 rather than full e-mail addresses.
 89 
 90 The _contributed-by_ line is optional. If present, it
 91 is a list of comma-separated email addresses. It should be included only when
 92 the author or authors of the change do not have commit rights to the target
 93 repository and thus would not otherwise receive acknowledgment.
 94 
 95 There will be exceptions for merge changesets, tag changesets, etc.
 96 
 97 Example:
 98 
<span class="line-modified"> 99     1234567: NPE thrown on FileInputStream(&quot;&quot;)</span>
<span class="line-modified">100     Summary: Rewrite precondition-checking code in io.c</span>
<span class="line-modified">101     Reviewed-by: mr</span>
<span class="line-modified">102     Contributed-by: Ben Bitdiddle &lt;ben at bits.org&gt;</span>
103 
104 If a changeset contains multiple unrelated changes (this is frowned upon, but
105 may happen from time to time) then its comment will contain multiple blocks of
106 the above form, separated by blank lines.
107 
108 The required format of the comments will be enforced whenever the changeset is
109 pushed into the JDK master or team repository forests. Other Projects may copy
110 these conventions, adopt some other conventions, or have no conventions,
111 depending upon their goals.
112 
113 #### Committing a Changeset
114 
115 The following commands commit all of the changes in a repository to a
116 changeset.
117 
<span class="line-modified">118     $ cat ../message</span>
<span class="line-modified">119     1111111: Missing Duke gif</span>
<span class="line-modified">120     Summary:  Add missing file</span>
<span class="line-modified">121     Reviewed-by: iag</span>
<span class="line-modified">122     $ hg commit -l ../message</span>
<span class="line-modified">123     $ hg toutgoing</span>
<span class="line-modified">124     [.]</span>

132 
133 ## Merging
134 
135 It is often necessary to merge local changes with those made in the parent
136 repositories. The first step in a merge process is to retrieve (or pull) the
137 collection of changesets which have been pushed since the last merge or initial
138 clone. If there if there are merge conflicts, then they must be resolved.
139 [Chapter 3](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch3.html#x7-530003) of
140 the Mercurial book contains detailed information on the
141 merging process.
142 
143 There are two basic ways to update the working set files in the repositories:
144 
145 Option 1: _**`hg`**_ `pull`
146 
147 &gt; One way to merge the parent repository with the working set of files is to use
148 &gt; _**`hg`**_ `pull` all by itself. This option allows merging off-line or at a
149 &gt; later time.
150 &gt;
<span class="line-modified">151 &gt;     $ hg pull</span>
<span class="line-modified">152 &gt;     [.]</span>
<span class="line-modified">153 &gt;     pulling from http://hg.openjdk.java.net/sandbox/box</span>
<span class="line-modified">154 &gt;     searching for changes</span>
<span class="line-modified">155 &gt;     no changes found</span>
156 &gt;
157 &gt; In Mercurial, pulling changesets will not update or merge into the working set
158 &gt; of files. To update the clone, run _**`hg`**_ `update`. If the update
159 &gt; reports conflicts, run _**`hg`**_ `merge` to resolve them.
160 
161 Option 2: _**`hg`**_ `fetch`
162 
163 &gt; Alternatively, use _**`hg`**_ `fetch` to pull the changes, update the
164 &gt; working set files, and create simple merge changesets as necessary. The
165 &gt; fetch extension is distributed with Mercurial but needs to be enabled. Edit
166 &gt; the `.hgrc` to include the following entries:
167 &gt;
<span class="line-modified">168 &gt;     [extensions]</span>
<span class="line-modified">169 &gt;     fetch=</span>
170 &gt;
171 &gt; Once the fetch extension has been enabled, _**`hg`**_ `fetch` may be invoked as follows:
172 &gt;
<span class="line-modified">173 &gt;     $ hg fetch</span>
<span class="line-modified">174 &gt;     [.]</span>
<span class="line-modified">175 &gt;     pulling from http://hg.openjdk.java.net/sandbox/box</span>
<span class="line-modified">176 &gt;     searching for changes</span>
<span class="line-modified">177 &gt;     no changes found</span>
178 
179 &gt; ---
180 &gt; Actual file merging will be done with the selected Mercurial merging tool see
181 &gt; [MergeProgram](https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MergeProgram)
182 &gt; for the details on how to define the selected merge tool in ` ~/.hgrc`.
183 
184 &gt; ---
185 
186 ## Pushing
187 
188 In order to push changesets into the parent repository, some additional
189 configuration is required. The following sections describe the operations that
190 will be performed by users with push access.
191 
192 #### Generating an SSH Key
193 
194 All pushes require an ssh key which must be installed on the Mercurial server.
195 The `ssh-keygen` command generates an ssh key. The
196 `-b` option overrides the default number of bits
197 for the key. Allow a few minutes to generate a 4096 bit key; a key of at least
198 2048 bits is recommended. While it is possible to use ssh without a passphrase,
199 this is **strongly** discouraged. Empty or
200 insecure passphrases may be reset using `ssh-keygen
201 -p`; this does not change the keys.
202 
<span class="line-modified">203     $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096</span>
<span class="line-modified">204     Enter file in which to save the key(/u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa):</span>
<span class="line-modified">205     Generating public/private rsa key pair.</span>
<span class="line-modified">206     Enter passphrase(empty for no passphrase):</span>
<span class="line-modified">207     Enter same passphrase again:</span>
<span class="line-modified">208     Your identification has been saved in /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa.</span>
<span class="line-modified">209     Your public key has been saved in /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.</span>
<span class="line-modified">210     The key fingerprint is:</span>
<span class="line-modified">211     md5 4096 c2:b7:00:e6:4b:da:ea:ec:32:30:f5:bd:12:26:04:83 iris@duke</span>
<span class="line-modified">212     The key&#39;s randomart image is:</span>
<span class="line-modified">213     +--[ RSA 4096]----+</span>
<span class="line-modified">214     |    E.=          |</span>
<span class="line-modified">215     |     . *         |</span>
<span class="line-modified">216     |      o .   .    |</span>
<span class="line-modified">217     |         + o     |</span>
<span class="line-modified">218     |        S + .    |</span>
<span class="line-modified">219     |       .   + .   |</span>
<span class="line-modified">220     |        + + +..  |</span>
<span class="line-modified">221     |       * . oo+.  |</span>
<span class="line-modified">222     |      o . .o..   |</span>
<span class="line-modified">223     +-----------------+</span>
224 
225 The `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` is a text file
226 containing the public ssh key. This file should be mailed as an attachment
227 along with the JDK username to
228 [keys(at)openjdk.java.net](mailto:keys-at-openjdk.java.net).
229 An administrator will install your key on the server and notify you on
230 completion. This process may take a couple of days.
231 
232 &gt; ---
233 &gt; Users behind a SOCKS firewall can add a directive to the
234 &gt; `~/.ssh/config` file to connect to the OpenJDK
235 &gt; Mercurial server:
236 &gt; 
<span class="line-modified">237 &gt;     Host *.openjdk.java.net</span>
<span class="line-modified">238 &gt;     ProxyCommand /usr/lib/ssh/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect -h [socks_proxy_address] %h %p</span>
239 &gt;
240 &gt; See the `ssh-socks5-proxy-connect` man page and
241 &gt; `ssh-config` man page for more information. Other
242 &gt; systems may require proxy access via other programs. Some Linux distributions
243 &gt; provide the `corkscrew` package which provides ssh
244 &gt; access through HTTP proxies.
245 &gt; 
246 &gt; **It is recommended that all users check with their network
247 &gt; administrators before installing any kind of TCP forwarding tool on their
248 &gt; network. Many corporations and institutions have strict security policies in
249 &gt; this area.**
250 
251 &gt; ---
252 
253 #### SSH Shortcuts
254 
255 The following section provides some tips for improving the usability of
256 ssh-related operations.
257 
258 * _Using SSH in multiple shells_
259 
260   To avoid having to constantly type in the passphrase, use the ssh-agent on your
261   local client to cache your pashphrase:
262 
<span class="line-modified">263       $ eval `ssh-agent`</span>
<span class="line-modified">264       Agent pid 17450</span>
<span class="line-modified">265       $ ssh-add</span>
<span class="line-modified">266       Enter passphrase for /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa:</span>
<span class="line-modified">267       Identity added: /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa(/u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa)</span>
268 
269   The same ssh-agent process can be shared with multiple shells. There are
270   various ways to do this. Bash users can accomplish this with the following code
271   in `.bashrc`:
272 
<span class="line-modified">273       if [ &quot;$PS1&quot; -a -d $HOME/.ssh ]; then</span>
<span class="line-modified">274         if [ &quot;x$SSH_AUTH_SOCK&quot; = x ]; then</span>
<span class="line-modified">275           eval `ssh-agent | grep -v &#39;echo Agent pid&#39;`</span>
<span class="line-modified">276           ssh-add</span>
<span class="line-modified">277           trap &quot;echo Killing SSH agent $SSH_AGENT_PID; kill $SSH_AGENT_PID&quot; 0</span>
<span class="line-modified">278         fi</span>
<span class="line-modified">279       fi</span>
280 
281   For secure operation, only start an ssh-agent when needed and kill it off when
282   the shell completes. Test this by running `ssh &#39;hostname&#39; echo
283   hello` multiple times.
284 
285 * _Logging in without a password_
286 
287   To avoid needing to constantly type in the password, add the public key to the
288   list of ssh authorized keys.
289 
<span class="line-modified">290       $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</span>
<span class="line-modified">291       $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</span>
292 
293 #### Setting the `default-push` Path to the Server Repositories
294 
295 &lt;!-- 
296 #. Option 1: Add default-push path to every &lt;code&gt;.hg/hgrc&lt;/code&gt;
297 --&gt;
298 
299 This is the typical development model:
300 
301 :::{style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;}
302 ![Diagram of server repos and user&#39;s clone](devModel.gif)
303 :::
304 
305 Changesets need to be _pushed_ via ssh to the
306 read/write repository which resides on the OpenJDK Mercurial server. The
307 easiest way to do this is to have each repository define the &quot;default-push&quot;
308 path in every repository&#39;s `.hg/hgrc` file. The
309 `.hg/hgrc` file in is not a managed file - it is
310 private to the repository. The following example defines the &quot;default&quot; and
311 &quot;default-push&quot; paths for clones of the jdk9/dev team repository.
312 
<span class="line-modified">313     [paths]</span>
<span class="line-modified">314     default = http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev</span>
<span class="line-modified">315     default-push = ssh://&lt;JDK_username&gt;@hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev</span>
316 
317 Given a `JDK_username` this simple script will
318 attempt to do this for all the repositories:
319 
<span class="line-modified">320     #!/bin/sh</span>
<span class="line-modified">321     username=$1</span>
<span class="line-modified">322     hgdirs=&quot;`find . -type d -name .hg`&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">323     for i in ${hgdirs}; do</span>
<span class="line-modified">324       d=&quot;`dirname ${i}`&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">325       defpush=&quot;`(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths default-push 2&gt; /dev/null)`&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">326       if [ &quot;${defpush}&quot; = &quot;&quot; ] ; then</span>
<span class="line-modified">327         defpath=&quot;`(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths default 2&gt; /dev/null)`&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">328         if [ &quot;${defpath}&quot; != &quot;&quot; ] ; then</span>
<span class="line-modified">329           defpush=&quot;`echo ${defpath} | sed -e &#39;s@http://\([^/]*/[^/]*/[^/]*\)/\(.*\)@ssh://$username\@\1/\2@&#39;`&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">330           cp ${i}/hgrc ${i}/hgrc.orig</span>
<span class="line-modified">331           echo &quot;default-push = ${defpush}&quot; &gt;&gt; ${i}/hgrc</span>
<span class="line-modified">332           echo &quot;Added default-push: ${defpush}&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">333         fi</span>
<span class="line-modified">334       fi</span>
<span class="line-modified">335     done</span>
<span class="line-modified">336     for i in ${hgdirs}; do</span>
<span class="line-modified">337       d=&quot;`dirname ${i}`&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">338       echo &quot;(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths)&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">339       (cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths)</span>
<span class="line-modified">340     done</span>
<span class="line-modified">341     exit 0</span>
342 
343 &lt;!--
344 #. Option 2: Use the &lt;code&gt;defpath&lt;/code&gt; ExtensionAnother way to setup the default-push path is to use the Mercurial defpath
345     extension, which is available in /java/jdk/lib/hgext/defpath.py. To enable
346     this extension add the following to the &lt;code&gt;~/hgrc&lt;/code&gt; file:
347 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
348 [extensions]
349 defpath = /java/jdk/lib/hgext/defpath.py  # Or the pathname of a local copy
350 &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
351      The defpath extension actually adds two new Mercurial subcommands:
352     defpath to operate upon a single repository and fdefpath for an entire
353     forest. hg help defpath or hg help fdefpath will tell you more. For a
354     freshly cloned open/closed forest the command you probably want is
355 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
356 $ hg fdefpath -dgv
357 &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
358      Be sure to try this with the -n flag first to see if it will do what
359     you actually expect. If your OpenJDK username differs from your Oracle
360     username then add -u name to the command line.
361      The defpath extension defines the default-push path, which is the path
362     that Mercurial uses by default in push operations.
363 --&gt;
364 
365 #### Pushing a Changeset
366 
367 [Committers](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer)
368 can use the _**hg**_ `push` command to propagate changesets into the repositories.
369 
370 Most developers will only find a need to create changesets in one or two
371 repositories. However, it is important that before any changesets are pushed,
372 the corresponding forest pull and merge with the destination forest be
373 performed; otherwise there is a risk of breaking the build.
374 
<span class="line-modified">375     $ hg push</span>
376 
377 After the push has been accepted, an automatic e-mail notification will be sent
378 to the [mailing list](https://mail.openjdk.java.net) associated with the
379 repository. In most cases notifications
380 are sent to the Project&#39;s _-dev_ mailing list. Some
381 Projects with high traffic _-dev_ mailing lists use a
382 dedicated _-changes_ list for notifications.
383 
384 &gt; ---
385 &gt; Who has push access?
386 &gt;
387 &gt; All of a Project&#39;s [Committers](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer)
388 &gt; can push to all of the the Project&#39;s repositories.
389 &gt;
390 &gt; Some Projects may chose to restrict the set of Committers with push to key
391 &gt; repositories. For instance, JDK Release Projects restrict push access to MASTER
392 &gt; repositories to Committers who are either integrators or members of the Release
393 &gt; Engineering Team.
