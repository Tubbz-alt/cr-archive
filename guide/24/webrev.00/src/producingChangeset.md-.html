  7 This section is confined to the actual Mercurial mechanics required to produce
  8 a changeset:
  9 
 10 * [Setting a JDK User Name](#setting-a-jdk-user-name) reminds
 11 the user to confirm proper configuration.
 12 * [Creating](#creating) includes instructions for the
 13 required format of a changeset comment and describes how to commit files to a
 14 changeset.
 15 * [Merging](#merging) describes how to pull changes
 16 from a parent forest or clone and incorporate the changes into the current
 17 working set of files.
 18 * [Pushing](#pushing) covers configuring ssh, setting
 19 the `default-push` path, and pushing changesets.
 20 
 21 ## Setting a JDK User Name
 22 
 23 Ensure that _ui.username_ has a value in the
 24 `~/.hgrc` file as described in
 25 [Verifying the Configuration](repositories.html#verify).
 26 
 27 ## Creating
 28 
 29 The timing for creating a changeset is important. Creating the changeset long
 30 before it gets pushed into the parent repository may require complex merges. If
 31 a changeset is created before sufficient review or testing, a rollback may be
 32 required and a new changeset may be required to correct previous mistakes. The
 33 [mq extension](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch12.html#x16-26500012) is
 34 recommended for managing changes before they become
 35 committed to a changeset.
 36 
 37 In the examples below, the script
 38 `common/bin/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply the
 39 Mercurial command to all the repositories in the forest. So when you see
 40 _**`hg`**_, if you are dealing with one repository, just use
 41 &quot;`hg`&quot;, if it&#39;s a forest, use &quot;`sh common/bin/hgforest.sh`&quot;.
 42 
 43 
 44 Each repository in the forest is managed independently. After editing files in
 45 the individual cloned repositories of the forest, the `hg
 46 status` command may be used to see the changes in a single
 47 repository.
 48 
 49 &gt;     $ hg root
 50 &gt;     /u/iris/sandbox/box
 51 &gt;     $ hg status
 52 &gt;     ? duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png
 53 &gt;     $ hg add duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png
 54 &gt;     $ hg status
 55 &gt;     A duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png
 56 
 57 To see changes made to the repositories use _**`hg`**_ `status`:
 58 
 59 &gt;     $ hg status
 60 &gt;     [.]
 61 &gt;     A duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png
 62 
 63 In this example, the repository was previously cloned as described in
 64 [Cloning a Sandbox Repository](repositories.html#cloneSandbox). A new file
 65 `DukeTubbingSmall.png` was added to a new subdirectory.
 66 
 67 #### Formatting a Changeset Comment
 68 
 69 A single change is described by a block of text of the following form:
 70 
 71 &gt;     &lt;bugid&gt;: &lt;synopsis-of-symptom&gt;
 72 &gt;     Summary: &lt;summary-of-code-change&gt;
 73 &gt;     Reviewed-by: &lt;reviewer&gt;+
 74 &gt;     Contributed-by: &lt;contributor-email&gt;
 75 
 76 There may be more than one _bugid_ line, but there
 77 must be at least one.
 78 
 79 The _summary_ line is optional, but authors are
 80 strongly encouraged to include one if the nature of the change is not obvious
 81 from the synopsis. It&#39;s just one line, meant to give the reader a clue as to
 82 how the code changed. A more complete description of the change belongs in the
 83 bug report.
 84 
 85 A _reviewed-by_ line is required. Reviewers must have
 86 the ability to deal with any adverse consequences of the change, and so must
 87 themselves be authors. They are therefore identified by their OpenJDK usernames
 88 rather than full e-mail addresses.
 89 
 90 The _contributed-by_ line is optional. If present, it
 91 is a list of comma-separated email addresses. It should be included only when
 92 the author or authors of the change do not have commit rights to the target
 93 repository and thus would not otherwise receive acknowledgment.
 94 
 95 There will be exceptions for merge changesets, tag changesets, etc.
 96 
 97 Example:
 98 
 99 &gt;     1234567: NPE thrown on FileInputStream(&quot;&quot;)
100 &gt;     Summary: Rewrite precondition-checking code in io.c
101 &gt;     Reviewed-by: mr
102 &gt;     Contributed-by: Ben Bitdiddle &lt;ben at bits.org&gt;
103 
104 If a changeset contains multiple unrelated changes (this is frowned upon, but
105 may happen from time to time) then its comment will contain multiple blocks of
106 the above form, separated by blank lines.
107 
108 The required format of the comments will be enforced whenever the changeset is
109 pushed into the JDK master or team repository forests. Other Projects may copy
110 these conventions, adopt some other conventions, or have no conventions,
111 depending upon their goals.
112 
113 #### Committing a Changeset
114 
115 The following commands commit all of the changes in a repository to a
116 changeset.
117 
118 &gt;     $ cat ../message
119 &gt;     1111111: Missing Duke gif
120 &gt;     Summary:  Add missing file
121 &gt;     Reviewed-by: iag
122 &gt;     $ hg commit -l ../message
123 &gt;     $ hg toutgoing

131 &gt;     summary:     1111111: Missing Duke gif
132 
133 ## Merging
134 
135 It is often necessary to merge local changes with those made in the parent
136 repositories. The first step in a merge process is to retrieve (or pull) the
137 collection of changesets which have been pushed since the last merge or initial
138 clone. If there if there are merge conflicts, then they must be resolved.
139 [Chapter 3](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch3.html#x7-530003) of
140 the Mercurial book contains detailed information on the
141 merging process.
142 
143 There are two basic ways to update the working set files in the repositories:
144 
145 Option 1: _**`hg`**_ `pull`
146 
147 &gt; One way to merge the parent repository with the working set of files is to use
148 &gt; _**`hg`**_ `pull` all by itself. This option allows merging off-line or at a
149 &gt; later time.
150 &gt;
151 &gt;&gt;     $ hg pull
152 &gt;&gt;     [.]
153 &gt;&gt;     pulling from http://hg.openjdk.java.net/sandbox/box
154 &gt;&gt;     searching for changes
155 &gt;&gt;     no changes found
156 &gt;
157 &gt; In Mercurial, pulling changesets will not update or merge into the working set
158 &gt; of files. To update the clone, run _**`hg`**_ `update`. If the update
159 &gt; reports conflicts, run _**`hg`**_ `merge` to resolve them.
160 
161 Option 2: _**`hg`**_ `fetch`
162 
163 &gt; Alternatively, use _**`hg`**_ `fetch` to pull the changes, update the
164 &gt; working set files, and create simple merge changesets as necessary. The
165 &gt; fetch extension is distributed with Mercurial but needs to be enabled. Edit
166 &gt; the `.hgrc` to include the following entries:
167 &gt;
168 &gt;&gt;     [extensions]
169 &gt;&gt;     fetch=
170 &gt;
171 &gt; Once the fetch extension has been enabled, _**`hg`**_ `fetch` may be invoked as follows:
172 &gt;
173 &gt;&gt;     $ hg fetch
174 &gt;&gt;     [.]
175 &gt;&gt;     pulling from http://hg.openjdk.java.net/sandbox/box
176 &gt;&gt;     searching for changes
177 &gt;&gt;     no changes found
178 
179 &gt; ---
180 &gt; Actual file merging will be done with the selected Mercurial merging tool see
181 &gt; [MergeProgram](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MergeProgram)
182 &gt; for the details on how to define the selected merge tool in ` ~/.hgrc`.
183 
184 &gt; ---
185 
186 ## Pushing
187 
188 In order to push changesets into the parent repository, some additional
189 configuration is required. The following sections describe the operations that
190 will be performed by users with push access.
191 
192 #### Generating an SSH Key
193 
194 All pushes require an ssh key which must be installed on the Mercurial server.
195 The `ssh-keygen` command generates an ssh key. The
196 `-b` option overrides the default number of bits
197 for the key. Allow a few minutes to generate a 4096 bit key; a key of at least
198 2048 bits is recommended. While it is possible to use ssh without a passphrase,
199 this is **strongly** discouraged. Empty or
200 insecure passphrases may be reset using `ssh-keygen
201 -p`; this does not change the keys.
202 
203 &gt;     $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
204 &gt;     Enter file in which to save the key(/u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa):
205 &gt;     Generating public/private rsa key pair.
206 &gt;     Enter passphrase(empty for no passphrase):
207 &gt;     Enter same passphrase again:
208 &gt;     Your identification has been saved in /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa.
209 &gt;     Your public key has been saved in /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
210 &gt;     The key fingerprint is:
211 &gt;     md5 4096 c2:b7:00:e6:4b:da:ea:ec:32:30:f5:bd:12:26:04:83 iris@duke
212 &gt;     The key&#39;s randomart image is:
213 &gt;     +--[ RSA 4096]----+
214 &gt;     |    E.=          |
215 &gt;     |     . *         |
216 &gt;     |      o .   .    |
217 &gt;     |         + o     |
218 &gt;     |        S + .    |
219 &gt;     |       .   + .   |
220 &gt;     |        + + +..  |
221 &gt;     |       * . oo+.  |
222 &gt;     |      o . .o..   |
223 &gt;     +-----------------+
224 
225 The `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` is a text file
226 containing the public ssh key. This file should be mailed as an attachment
227 along with the JDK username to
228 [keys(at)openjdk.java.net](mailto:keys-at-openjdk.java.net).
229 An administrator will install your key on the server and notify you on
230 completion. This process may take a couple of days.
231 
232 &gt; ---
233 &gt; Users behind a SOCKS firewall can add a directive to the
234 &gt; `~/.ssh/config` file to connect to the OpenJDK
235 &gt; Mercurial server:
236 &gt; 
237 &gt;&gt;     Host *.openjdk.java.net
238 &gt;&gt;     ProxyCommand /usr/lib/ssh/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect -h [socks_proxy_address] %h %p
239 &gt;
240 &gt; See the `ssh-socks5-proxy-connect` man page and
241 &gt; `ssh-config` man page for more information. Other
242 &gt; systems may require proxy access via other programs. Some Linux distributions
243 &gt; provide the `corkscrew` package which provides ssh
244 &gt; access through HTTP proxies.
245 &gt; 
246 &gt; **It is recommended that all users check with their network
247 &gt; administrators before installing any kind of TCP forwarding tool on their
248 &gt; network. Many corporations and institutions have strict security policies in
249 &gt; this area.**
250 
251 &gt; ---
252 
253 #### SSH Shortcuts
254 
255 The following section provides some tips for improving the usability of
256 ssh-related operations.
257 
258 * _Using SSH in multiple shells_
259 
260   To avoid having to constantly type in the passphrase, use the ssh-agent on your
261   local client to cache your pashphrase:
262 
263   &gt;     $ eval `ssh-agent`
264   &gt;     Agent pid 17450
265   &gt;     $ ssh-add
266   &gt;     Enter passphrase for /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa:
267   &gt;     Identity added: /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa(/u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa)
268 
269   The same ssh-agent process can be shared with multiple shells. There are
270   various ways to do this. Bash users can accomplish this with the following code
271   in `.bashrc`:
272 
273   &gt;     if [ &quot;$PS1&quot; -a -d $HOME/.ssh ]; then
274   &gt;       if [ &quot;x$SSH_AUTH_SOCK&quot; = x ]; then
275   &gt;         eval `ssh-agent | grep -v &#39;echo Agent pid&#39;`
276   &gt;         ssh-add
277   &gt;         trap &quot;echo Killing SSH agent $SSH_AGENT_PID; kill $SSH_AGENT_PID&quot; 0
278   &gt;       fi
279   &gt;     fi
280 
281   For secure operation, only start an ssh-agent when needed and kill it off when
282   the shell completes. Test this by running `ssh &#39;hostname&#39; echo
283   hello` multiple times.
284 
285 * _Logging in without a password_
286 
287   To avoid needing to constantly type in the password, add the public key to the
288   list of ssh authorized keys.
289 
290   &gt;     $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
291   &gt;     $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
292 
293 #### Setting the `default-push` Path to the Server Repositories
294 
295 &lt;!-- 
296 #. Option 1: Add default-push path to every &lt;code&gt;.hg/hgrc&lt;/code&gt;
297 --&gt;
298 
299 This is the typical development model:
300 
301 :::{style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;}
302 ![Diagram of server repos and user&#39;s clone](devModel.gif)
303 :::
304 
305 Changesets need to be _pushed_ via ssh to the
306 read/write repository which resides on the OpenJDK Mercurial server. The
307 easiest way to do this is to have each repository define the &quot;default-push&quot;
308 path in every repository&#39;s `.hg/hgrc` file. The
309 `.hg/hgrc` file in is not a managed file - it is
310 private to the repository. The following example defines the &quot;default&quot; and
311 &quot;default-push&quot; paths for clones of the jdk9/dev team repository.
312 
313 &gt;     [paths]
314 &gt;     default = http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev
315 &gt;     default-push = ssh://&lt;JDK_username&gt;@hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev
316 
317 Given a `JDK_username` this simple script will
318 attempt to do this for all the repositories:
319 
320 &gt;     #!/bin/sh
321 &gt;     username=$1
322 &gt;     hgdirs=&quot;`find . -type d -name .hg`&quot;
323 &gt;     for i in ${hgdirs}; do
324 &gt;       d=&quot;`dirname ${i}`&quot;
325 &gt;       defpush=&quot;`(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths default-push 2&gt; /dev/null)`&quot;
326 &gt;       if [ &quot;${defpush}&quot; = &quot;&quot; ] ; then
327 &gt;         defpath=&quot;`(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths default 2&gt; /dev/null)`&quot;
328 &gt;         if [ &quot;${defpath}&quot; != &quot;&quot; ] ; then
329 &gt;           defpush=&quot;`echo ${defpath} | sed -e &#39;s@http://\([^/]*/[^/]*/[^/]*\)/\(.*\)@ssh://$username\@\1/\2@&#39;`&quot;
330 &gt;           cp ${i}/hgrc ${i}/hgrc.orig
331 &gt;           echo &quot;default-push = ${defpush}&quot; &gt;&gt; ${i}/hgrc
332 &gt;           echo &quot;Added default-push: ${defpush}&quot;
333 &gt;         fi
334 &gt;       fi
335 &gt;     done
336 &gt;     for i in ${hgdirs}; do
337 &gt;       d=&quot;`dirname ${i}`&quot;
338 &gt;       echo &quot;(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths)&quot;
339 &gt;       (cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths)
340 &gt;     done
341 &gt;     exit 0
342 
343 &lt;!--
344 #. Option 2: Use the &lt;code&gt;defpath&lt;/code&gt; ExtensionAnother way to setup the default-push path is to use the Mercurial defpath
345     extension, which is available in /java/jdk/lib/hgext/defpath.py. To enable
346     this extension add the following to the &lt;code&gt;~/hgrc&lt;/code&gt; file:
347 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
348 [extensions]
349 defpath = /java/jdk/lib/hgext/defpath.py  # Or the pathname of a local copy
350 &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
351      The defpath extension actually adds two new Mercurial subcommands:
352     defpath to operate upon a single repository and fdefpath for an entire
353     forest. hg help defpath or hg help fdefpath will tell you more. For a
354     freshly cloned open/closed forest the command you probably want is
355 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
356 $ hg fdefpath -dgv
357 &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
358      Be sure to try this with the -n flag first to see if it will do what
359     you actually expect. If your OpenJDK username differs from your Oracle
360     username then add -u name to the command line.
361      The defpath extension defines the default-push path, which is the path
362     that Mercurial uses by default in push operations.
363 --&gt;
364 
365 #### Pushing a Changeset
366 
367 [Committers](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer)
368 can use the _**hg**_ `push` command to propagate changesets into the repositories.
369 
370 Most developers will only find a need to create changesets in one or two
371 repositories. However, it is important that before any changesets are pushed,
372 the corresponding forest pull and merge with the destination forest be
373 performed; otherwise there is a risk of breaking the build.
374 
375 &gt;     $ hg push
376 
377 After the push has been accepted, an automatic e-mail notification will be sent
378 to the [mailing list](http://mail.openjdk.java.net) associated with the
379 repository. In most cases notifications
380 are sent to the Project&#39;s _-dev_ mailing list. Some
381 Projects with high traffic _-dev_ mailing lists use a
382 dedicated _-changes_ list for notifications.
383 
384 &gt; ---
385 &gt; Who has push access?
386 &gt;
387 &gt; All of a Project&#39;s [Committers](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer)
388 &gt; can push to all of the the Project&#39;s repositories.
389 &gt;
390 &gt; Some Projects may chose to restrict the set of Committers with push to key
391 &gt; repositories. For instance, JDK Release Projects restrict push access to MASTER
392 &gt; repositories to Committers who are either integrators or members of the Release
393 &gt; Engineering Team.
394 &gt;
395 &gt; Refer to the
396 &gt; [Nominating a Contributor or Author to be a Committer](../projects/index.html#project-committer)
397 &gt; section of the [Project](../projects/index.html) page for
398 &gt; information about becoming a Project Committer.
