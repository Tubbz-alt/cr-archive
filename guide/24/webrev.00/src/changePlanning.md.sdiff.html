 30 &gt; Some steps refer to operations which can not be performed directly without the
 31 &gt; assistance of a [Project Committer](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer).
 32 &gt; For example, any changes to the
 33 &gt; [bug database](http://bugs.openjdk.java.net) fall into
 34 &gt; this category. Since these steps are required,
 35 &gt; [Contributors](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#contributor)
 36 &gt; are urged to work with their [Sponsors](/sponsor/)
 37 &gt; to complete these tasks.

 41 For the purposes of brevity this document will use the term &quot;bug&quot; to refer to
 42 both bugs and enhancements unless otherwise noted. Hence &quot;fix for a bug&quot; could
 43 also imply &quot;implementation for an enhancement&quot;.
 44 
 45 #. **Discuss the intended change**
 46 
 47    Send an e-mail to the appropriate development mailing list for the Project that
 48    maintains the code. The e-mail should have a subject line of the form:
 49 
<span class="line-modified"> 50    &gt;     6543210: My favorite bug</span>
 51 
 52    where `6543210` is replaced with the actual bug id number or
 53    &quot;[NEW BUG]&quot; if the bug id is not known and `My favorite bug` is
 54    replaced with the bug&#39;s summary.  The message should describe the intended
 55    change, which components may be affected, and any other risks or
 56    concerns.
 57 
 58 #. **Does a bug id exist for the work?**
 59 
 60    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 61     Y   Continue
 62 
 63     N   Create a bug in an appropriate component/sub-component.
 64    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 65 
 66 #. **Set the bug status to &quot;Open&quot;**
 67 
 68    This communicates intent to fix the bug to other members of the Project. It
 69    also sets the expectation for downstream teams such as SQE and JCK that the bug
 70    will be fixed in an upcoming integration.
