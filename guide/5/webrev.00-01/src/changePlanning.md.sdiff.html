 11 This section describes the development process of identifying a bug or
 12 enhancement (formerly &quot;Request for Enhancement&quot; (RFE)) and providing a
 13 solution. The instructions assume that the
 14 [Contributor](/bylaws#contributor) already has a
 15 working build environment and has some familiarity with an existing OpenJDK
 16 [Project](bylaws#_6) and its repositories.
 17 
 18 Three classes of changes are treated in separate sections:
 19 
 20 * [Fixing a Bug](#fixing-a-bug) provides a step-by-step
 21 workflow for fixing a simple bug. Of particular note is the list of
 22 [noreg bug labels](#noreg) for changes which do not have regression tests.
 23 * [Adding an API](#adding-an-api) is TBD.
 24 * [Adding a Feature/JSR](#adding-a-featurejsr) is TBD.

286 ## Adding an API
287 
288 TBD
289 
290 This section will cover additional considerations for changes that add new
291 public APIs. For instance, they need to be implementable on all platforms.
292 
293 ## Adding a Feature/JSR
294 
295 TBD
296 
297 This section will describe the process for adding new functionality which
298 requires more than just a few new APIs. In particular, this will cover how the
299 JSR process interacts with the OpenJDK development life cycle.
