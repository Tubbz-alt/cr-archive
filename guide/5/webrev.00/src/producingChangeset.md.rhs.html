 11 This section is confined to the actual Mercurial mechanics required to produce
 12 a changeset:
 13 
 14 * [Setting a JDK User Name](#setting-a-jdk-user-name) reminds
 15 the user to confirm proper configuration.
 16 * [Creating](#creating) includes instructions for the
 17 required format of a changeset comment and describes how to commit files to a
 18 changeset.
 19 * [Merging](#merging) describes how to pull changes
 20 from a parent forest or clone and incorporate the changes into the current
 21 working set of files.
 22 * [Pushing](#pushing) covers configuring ssh, setting
 23 the `default-push` path, and pushing changesets.
 24 
 25 ## Setting a JDK User Name
 26 
 27 Ensure that _ui.username_ has a value in the
 28 `~/.hgrc` file as described in
 29 [Verifying the Configuration](repositories.html#verify).
 30 
 31 ## Creating
 32 
 33 The timing for creating a changeset is important. Creating the changeset long
 34 before it gets pushed into the parent repository may require complex merges. If
 35 a changeset is created before sufficient review or testing, a rollback may be
 36 required and a new changeset may be required to correct previous mistakes. The
 37 [mq extension](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch12.html#x16-26500012) is
 38 recommended for managing changes before they become
 39 committed to a changeset.
 40 
 41 In the examples below, the script
 42 `common/bin/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply the
 43 Mercurial command to all the repositories in the forest. So when you see
 44 _**`hg`**_, if you are dealing with one repository, just use
 45 &quot;`hg`&quot;, if it&#39;s a forest, use &quot;`sh common/bin/hgforest.sh`&quot;.
 46 
 47 
 48 Each repository in the forest is managed independently. After editing files in
 49 the individual cloned repositories of the forest, the `hg
 50 status` command may be used to see the changes in a single
 51 repository.
 52 
 53 &gt;     $ hg root
 54 &gt;     /u/iris/sandbox/box
 55 &gt;     $ hg status
 56 &gt;     ? duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png
 57 &gt;     $ hg add duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png
 58 &gt;     $ hg status
 59 &gt;     A duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png
 60 
 61 To see changes made to the repositories use _**`hg`**_ `status`:
 62 
 63 &gt;     $ hg status
 64 &gt;     [.]
 65 &gt;     A duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png
 66 
 67 In this example, the repository was previously cloned as described in
 68 [Cloning a Sandbox Repository](repositories.html#cloneSandbox). A new file
 69 `DukeTubbingSmall.png` was added to a new subdirectory.
 70 
 71 #### Formatting a Changeset Comment
 72 
 73 A single change is described by a block of text of the following form:
 74 
 75 &gt;     &lt;bugid&gt;: &lt;synopsis-of-symptom&gt;
 76 &gt;     Summary: &lt;summary-of-code-change&gt;
 77 &gt;     Reviewed-by: &lt;reviewer&gt;+
 78 &gt;     Contributed-by: &lt;contributor-email&gt;
 79 
 80 There may be more than one _bugid_ line, but there
 81 must be at least one.
 82 
 83 The _summary_ line is optional, but authors are
 84 strongly encouraged to include one if the nature of the change is not obvious
 85 from the synopsis. It&#39;s just one line, meant to give the reader a clue as to
 86 how the code changed. A more complete description of the change belongs in the
 87 bug report.
 88 
 89 A _reviewed-by_ line is required. Reviewers must have
 90 the ability to deal with any adverse consequences of the change, and so must
 91 themselves be authors. They are therefore identified by their OpenJDK usernames
 92 rather than full e-mail addresses.
 93 
 94 The _contributed-by_ line is optional. If present, it
 95 is a list of comma-separated email addresses. It should be included only when
 96 the author or authors of the change do not have commit rights to the target
 97 repository and thus would not otherwise receive acknowledgment.
 98 
 99 There will be exceptions for merge changesets, tag changesets, etc.
100 
101 Example:
102 
103 &gt;     1234567: NPE thrown on FileInputStream(&quot;&quot;)
104 &gt;     Summary: Rewrite precondition-checking code in io.c
105 &gt;     Reviewed-by: mr
106 &gt;     Contributed-by: Ben Bitdiddle &lt;ben at bits.org&gt;
107 
108 If a changeset contains multiple unrelated changes (this is frowned upon, but
109 may happen from time to time) then its comment will contain multiple blocks of
110 the above form, separated by blank lines.
111 
112 The required format of the comments will be enforced whenever the changeset is
113 pushed into the JDK master or team repository forests. Other Projects may copy
114 these conventions, adopt some other conventions, or have no conventions,
115 depending upon their goals.
116 
117 #### Committing a Changeset
118 
119 The following commands commit all of the changes in a repository to a
120 changeset.
121 
122 &gt;     $ cat ../message
123 &gt;     1111111: Missing Duke gif
124 &gt;     Summary:  Add missing file
125 &gt;     Reviewed-by: iag
126 &gt;     $ hg commit -l ../message
127 &gt;     $ hg toutgoing

136 
137 ## Merging
138 
139 It is often necessary to merge local changes with those made in the parent
140 repositories. The first step in a merge process is to retrieve (or pull) the
141 collection of changesets which have been pushed since the last merge or initial
142 clone. If there if there are merge conflicts, then they must be resolved.
143 [Chapter 3](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch3.html#x7-530003) of
144 the Mercurial book contains detailed information on the
145 merging process.
146 
147 There are two basic ways to update the working set files in the repositories:
148 
149 Option 1: _**`hg`**_ `pull`
150 
151 &gt; One way to merge the parent repository with the working set of files is to use
152 &gt; _**`hg`**_ `pull` all by itself. This option allows merging off-line or at a
153 &gt; later time.
154 &gt;
155 &gt;&gt;     $ hg pull
156 &gt;&gt;     [.]
157 &gt;&gt;     pulling from http://hg.openjdk.java.net/sandbox/box
158 &gt;&gt;     searching for changes
159 &gt;&gt;     no changes found
160 &gt;
161 &gt; In Mercurial, pulling changesets will not update or merge into the working set
162 &gt; of files. To update the clone, run _**`hg`**_ `update`. If the update
163 &gt; reports conflicts, run _**`hg`**_ `merge` to resolve them.
164 
165 Option 2: _**`hg`**_ `fetch`
166 
167 &gt; Alternatively, use _**`hg`**_ `fetch` to pull the changes, update the
168 &gt; working set files, and create simple merge changesets as necessary. The
169 &gt; fetch extension is distributed with Mercurial but needs to be enabled. Edit
170 &gt; the `.hgrc` to include the following entries:
171 &gt;
172 &gt;&gt;     [extensions]
173 &gt;&gt;     fetch=
174 &gt;
175 &gt; Once the fetch extension has been enabled, _**`hg`**_ `fetch` may be invoked as follows:
176 &gt;
177 &gt;&gt;     $ hg fetch
178 &gt;&gt;     [.]
179 &gt;&gt;     pulling from http://hg.openjdk.java.net/sandbox/box
180 &gt;&gt;     searching for changes
181 &gt;&gt;     no changes found
182 
183 &gt; ---
184 &gt; Actual file merging will be done with the selected Mercurial merging tool see
185 &gt; [MergeProgram](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MergeProgram)
186 &gt; for the details on how to define the selected merge tool in ` ~/.hgrc`.
187 
188 &gt; ---
189 
190 ## Pushing
191 
192 In order to push changesets into the parent repository, some additional
193 configuration is required. The following sections describe the operations that
194 will be performed by users with push access.
195 
196 #### Generating an SSH Key
197 
198 All pushes require an ssh key which must be installed on the Mercurial server.
199 The `ssh-keygen` command generates an ssh key. The
200 `-b` option overrides the default number of bits
201 for the key. Allow a few minutes to generate a 4096 bit key; a key of at least
202 2048 bits is recommended. While it is possible to use ssh without a passphrase,
203 this is **strongly** discouraged. Empty or
204 insecure passphrases may be reset using `ssh-keygen
205 -p`; this does not change the keys.
206 
207 &gt;     $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
208 &gt;     Enter file in which to save the key(/u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa):
209 &gt;     Generating public/private rsa key pair.
210 &gt;     Enter passphrase(empty for no passphrase):
211 &gt;     Enter same passphrase again:
212 &gt;     Your identification has been saved in /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa.
213 &gt;     Your public key has been saved in /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
214 &gt;     The key fingerprint is:
215 &gt;     md5 4096 c2:b7:00:e6:4b:da:ea:ec:32:30:f5:bd:12:26:04:83 iris@duke
216 &gt;     The key&#39;s randomart image is:
217 &gt;     +--[ RSA 4096]----+
218 &gt;     |    E.=          |
219 &gt;     |     . *         |
220 &gt;     |      o .   .    |
221 &gt;     |         + o     |
222 &gt;     |        S + .    |
223 &gt;     |       .   + .   |
224 &gt;     |        + + +..  |
225 &gt;     |       * . oo+.  |
226 &gt;     |      o . .o..   |
227 &gt;     +-----------------+
228 
229 The `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` is a text file
230 containing the public ssh key. This file should be mailed as an attachment
231 along with the JDK username to
232 [keys(at)openjdk.java.net](mailto:keys-at-openjdk.java.net).
233 An administrator will install your key on the server and notify you on
234 completion. This process may take a couple of days.
235 
236 &gt; ---
237 &gt; Users behind a SOCKS firewall can add a directive to the
238 &gt; `~/.ssh/config` file to connect to the OpenJDK
239 &gt; Mercurial server:
240 &gt; 
241 &gt;&gt;     Host *.openjdk.java.net
242 &gt;&gt;     ProxyCommand /usr/lib/ssh/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect -h [socks_proxy_address] %h %p
243 &gt;
244 &gt; See the `ssh-socks5-proxy-connect` man page and
245 &gt; `ssh-config` man page for more information. Other
246 &gt; systems may require proxy access via other programs. Some Linux distributions
247 &gt; provide the `corkscrew` package which provides ssh
248 &gt; access through HTTP proxies.
249 &gt; 
250 &gt; **It is recommended that all users check with their network
251 &gt; administrators before installing any kind of TCP forwarding tool on their
252 &gt; network. Many corporations and institutions have strict security policies in
253 &gt; this area.**
254 
255 &gt; ---
256 
257 #### SSH Shortcuts
258 
259 The following section provides some tips for improving the usability of
260 ssh-related operations.
261 
262 * _Using SSH in multiple shells_
263 
264   To avoid having to constantly type in the passphrase, use the ssh-agent on your
265   local client to cache your pashphrase:
266 
267   &gt;     $ eval `ssh-agent`
268   &gt;     Agent pid 17450
269   &gt;     $ ssh-add
270   &gt;     Enter passphrase for /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa:
271   &gt;     Identity added: /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa(/u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa)
272 
273   The same ssh-agent process can be shared with multiple shells. There are
274   various ways to do this. Bash users can accomplish this with the following code
275   in `.bashrc`:
276 
277   &gt;     if [ &quot;$PS1&quot; -a -d $HOME/.ssh ]; then
278   &gt;       if [ &quot;x$SSH_AUTH_SOCK&quot; = x ]; then
279   &gt;         eval `ssh-agent | grep -v &#39;echo Agent pid&#39;`
280   &gt;         ssh-add
281   &gt;         trap &quot;echo Killing SSH agent $SSH_AGENT_PID; kill $SSH_AGENT_PID&quot; 0
282   &gt;       fi
283   &gt;     fi
284 
285   For secure operation, only start an ssh-agent when needed and kill it off when
286   the shell completes. Test this by running `ssh &#39;hostname&#39; echo
287   hello` multiple times.
288 
289 * _Logging in without a password_
290 
291   To avoid needing to constantly type in the password, add the public key to the
292   list of ssh authorized keys.
293 
294   &gt;     $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
295   &gt;     $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
296 
297 #### Setting the `default-push` Path to the Server Repositories
298 
299 &lt;!-- 
300 #. Option 1: Add default-push path to every &lt;code&gt;.hg/hgrc&lt;/code&gt;
301 --&gt;
302 
303 This is the typical development model:
304 
305 :::{style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;}
306 ![Diagram of server repos and user&#39;s clone](devModel.gif)
307 :::
308 
309 Changesets need to be _pushed_ via ssh to the
310 read/write repository which resides on the OpenJDK Mercurial server. The
311 easiest way to do this is to have each repository define the &quot;default-push&quot;
312 path in every repository&#39;s `.hg/hgrc` file. The
313 `.hg/hgrc` file in is not a managed file - it is
314 private to the repository. The following example defines the &quot;default&quot; and
315 &quot;default-push&quot; paths for clones of the jdk9/dev team repository.
316 
317 &gt;     [paths]
318 &gt;     default = http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev
319 &gt;     default-push = ssh://&lt;JDK_username&gt;@hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev
320 
321 Given a `JDK_username` this simple script will
322 attempt to do this for all the repositories:
323 
324 &gt;     #!/bin/sh
325 &gt;     username=$1
326 &gt;     hgdirs=&quot;`find . -type d -name .hg`&quot;
327 &gt;     for i in ${hgdirs}; do
328 &gt;       d=&quot;`dirname ${i}`&quot;
329 &gt;       defpush=&quot;`(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths default-push 2&gt; /dev/null)`&quot;
330 &gt;       if [ &quot;${defpush}&quot; = &quot;&quot; ] ; then
331 &gt;         defpath=&quot;`(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths default 2&gt; /dev/null)`&quot;
332 &gt;         if [ &quot;${defpath}&quot; != &quot;&quot; ] ; then
333 &gt;           defpush=&quot;`echo ${defpath} | sed -e &#39;s@http://\([^/]*/[^/]*/[^/]*\)/\(.*\)@ssh://$username\@\1/\2@&#39;`&quot;
334 &gt;           cp ${i}/hgrc ${i}/hgrc.orig
335 &gt;           echo &quot;default-push = ${defpush}&quot; &gt;&gt; ${i}/hgrc
336 &gt;           echo &quot;Added default-push: ${defpush}&quot;
337 &gt;         fi
338 &gt;       fi
339 &gt;     done
340 &gt;     for i in ${hgdirs}; do
341 &gt;       d=&quot;`dirname ${i}`&quot;
342 &gt;       echo &quot;(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths)&quot;
343 &gt;       (cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths)
344 &gt;     done
345 &gt;     exit 0
346 
347 &lt;!--
348 #. Option 2: Use the &lt;code&gt;defpath&lt;/code&gt; ExtensionAnother way to setup the default-push path is to use the Mercurial defpath
349     extension, which is available in /java/jdk/lib/hgext/defpath.py. To enable
350     this extension add the following to the &lt;code&gt;~/hgrc&lt;/code&gt; file:
351 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
352 [extensions]
353 defpath = /java/jdk/lib/hgext/defpath.py  # Or the pathname of a local copy
354 &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
355      The defpath extension actually adds two new Mercurial subcommands:
356     defpath to operate upon a single repository and fdefpath for an entire
357     forest. hg help defpath or hg help fdefpath will tell you more. For a
358     freshly cloned open/closed forest the command you probably want is
359 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
360 $ hg fdefpath -dgv
361 &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
362      Be sure to try this with the -n flag first to see if it will do what
363     you actually expect. If your OpenJDK username differs from your Oracle
364     username then add -u name to the command line.
365      The defpath extension defines the default-push path, which is the path
366     that Mercurial uses by default in push operations.
367 --&gt;
368 
369 #### Pushing a Changeset
370 
371 [Committers](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer)
372 can use the _**hg**_ `push` command to propagate changesets into the repositories.
373 
374 Most developers will only find a need to create changesets in one or two
375 repositories. However, it is important that before any changesets are pushed,
376 the corresponding forest pull and merge with the destination forest be
377 performed; otherwise there is a risk of breaking the build.
378 
379 &gt;     $ hg push
380 
381 After the push has been accepted, an automatic e-mail notification will be sent
382 to the [mailing list](http://mail.openjdk.java.net) associated with the
383 repository. In most cases notifications
384 are sent to the Project&#39;s _-dev_ mailing list. Some
385 Projects with high traffic _-dev_ mailing lists use a
386 dedicated _-changes_ list for notifications.
387 
388 &gt; ---
389 &gt; Who has push access?
390 &gt;
391 &gt; All of a Project&#39;s [Committers](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer)
392 &gt; can push to all of the the Project&#39;s repositories.
393 &gt;
394 &gt; Some Projects may chose to restrict the set of Committers with push to key
395 &gt; repositories. For instance, JDK Release Projects restrict push access to MASTER
396 &gt; repositories to Committers who are either integrators or members of the Release
397 &gt; Engineering Team.
398 &gt;
399 &gt; Refer to the
400 &gt; [Nominating a Contributor or Author to be a Committer](../projects/index.html#project-committer)
401 &gt; section of the [Project](../projects/index.html) page for
402 &gt; information about becoming a Project Committer.
