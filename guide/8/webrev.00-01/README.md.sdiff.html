 1 # OpenJDK Developer&#39;s Guide
 2 
 3 This project maintains the [OpenJDK Developers&#39; Guide](https://openjdk.java.net/guide/).
 4 The goal of this guide is to answer questions that the developers of the JDK might have around
<span class="line-modified"> 5 development process, tooling, standards, et.c. The formal rules and processes are described in</span>
 6 other documents, like [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1) for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal
 7 &amp; Roadmap Process, or [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3) for the JDK Release Process.
 8 This guide is meant to be a complement with tutorials and examples for how to follow these rules
 9 and how to work together with the rest of the OpenJDK community.
10 
<span class="line-modified">11 There are many common use cases that isn&#39;t detailed in the formal process. This guide contains the</span>
12 defacto standard for how to work in such cases.
13 
14 ## Audience
15 
16 The target audience for this document is anyone in the OpenJDK community who aims to contribute
17 to the development of OpenJDK. The nature of such a document is to target those who are not
18 familiar with the process. People who are regular contributors would already know much of
19 what this guide has to offer. Still, the guide should work as a source of knowledge also for
20 experienced contributors. This means that any descriptions in the guide should be self-contained
21 or have explicit references to any information the reader is expected to already know. The information
22 should also be structured in such a way that it&#39;s easy to find details for any process, so that
23 one who already knows the big picture can quickly find that particular detail that was forgotten.
24 
25 ## Contributing
26 
27 To engage in the development of the guide itself create a private fork of the guide and join
28 the dedicated [guide-dev mail list](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/guide-dev).
