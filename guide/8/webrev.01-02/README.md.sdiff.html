 1 # OpenJDK Developer&#39;s Guide
 2 
<span class="line-modified"> 3 This project maintains the [OpenJDK Developers&#39; Guide](https://openjdk.java.net/guide/).</span>
 4 The goal of this guide is to answer questions that the developers of the JDK might have around
 5 development process, tooling, standards, etc. The formal rules and processes are described in
 6 other documents, like [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1) for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal
 7 &amp; Roadmap Process, or [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3) for the JDK Release Process.
 8 This guide is meant to be a complement with tutorials and examples for how to follow these rules
 9 and how to work together with the rest of the OpenJDK community.
10 
11 There are many common use cases that aren&#39;t detailed in the formal process. This guide contains the
12 defacto standard for how to work in such cases.
13 
14 ## Audience
15 
16 The target audience for this document is anyone in the OpenJDK community who aims to contribute
17 to the development of OpenJDK. The nature of such a document is to target those who are not
18 familiar with the process. People who are regular contributors would already know much of
<span class="line-modified">19 what this guide has to offer. Still, the guide should work as a source of knowledge also for</span>
<span class="line-modified">20 experienced contributors. This means that any descriptions in the guide should be self-contained</span>
21 or have explicit references to any information the reader is expected to already know. The information
22 should also be structured in such a way that it&#39;s easy to find details for any process, so that
23 one who already knows the big picture can quickly find that particular detail that was forgotten.
24 
25 ## Contributing
26 
<span class="line-modified">27 To engage in the development of the guide itself create a private fork of the guide and join</span>
28 the dedicated [guide-dev mail list](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/guide-dev).

<span class="line-modified">30 ## Building the guide</span>
31 
32 The project comes with a makefile. Simply type `make` to generate html files from the source
<span class="line-modified">33 markdown. The build requires the tools `pandoc` and `ìconv` and assumes a posix environment.</span>
34 The resulting html files in the `build` directory are exactly the files published on the
35 OpenJDK web server. There is however a larger framework on the web server with fonts and CSS
<span class="line-modified">36 that is not part of this guide project. This means that the html files as they are generated</span>
37 will not look exactly the same as the final published version. Still they are hopefully good
38 enough to proof read changes and see the layout in a browser.
