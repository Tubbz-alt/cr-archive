  The goal of this guide is to answer questions that the developers of the JDK might have around
  development process, tooling, standards, etc. The formal rules and processes are described in
  other documents, like [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1) for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal
  &amp; Roadmap Process, or [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3) for the JDK Release Process.
  This guide is meant to be a complement with tutorials and examples for how to follow these rules

  ## Audience
  
  The target audience for this document is anyone in the OpenJDK community who aims to contribute
  to the development of OpenJDK. The nature of such a document is to target those who are not
  familiar with the process. People who are regular contributors would already know much of

<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ what this guide has to offer. Still, the Developers&#39; Guide should work as a source of knowledge also</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ for experienced contributors. This means that any descriptions in the Guide should be self-contained</span>
  or have explicit references to any information the reader is expected to already know. The information
  should also be structured in such a way that it&#39;s easy to find details for any process, so that
  one who already knows the big picture can quickly find that particular detail that was forgotten.

  enough to proof read changes and see the layout in a browser.
