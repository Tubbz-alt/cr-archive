 11 This section describes the development process of identifying a bug or
 12 enhancement (formerly &quot;Request for Enhancement&quot; (RFE)) and providing a
 13 solution. The instructions assume that the
 14 [Contributor](/bylaws#contributor) already has a
 15 working build environment and has some familiarity with an existing OpenJDK
 16 [Project](bylaws#_6) and its repositories.
 17 
 18 Three classes of changes are treated in separate sections:
 19 
 20 * [Fixing a Bug](#fixing-a-bug) provides a step-by-step
 21 workflow for fixing a simple bug. Of particular note is the list of
 22 [noreg bug labels](#noreg) for changes which do not have regression tests.
 23 * [Adding an API](#adding-an-api) is TBD.
 24 * [Adding a Feature/JSR](#adding-a-featurejsr) is TBD.
 25 
 26 ## Fixing a Bug
 27 
 28 This is the list of steps which should be performed when fixing a small bug.
 29 Small bugs include typos in code or specification, algorithm improvements for
 30 correctness or performance, and code changes required to correctly implement
 31 the specification.
 32 
 33 &gt; ---
 34 &gt; Some steps refer to operations which can not be performed directly without the
 35 &gt; assistance of a [Project Committer](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer).
 36 &gt; For example, any changes to the
 37 &gt; [bug database](http://bugs.openjdk.java.net) fall into
 38 &gt; this category. Since these steps are required,
 39 &gt; [Contributors](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#contributor)
 40 &gt; are urged to work with their [Sponsors](/sponsor/)
 41 &gt; to complete these tasks.
 42 
 43 &gt; ---
 44 
 45 For the purposes of brevity this document will use the term &quot;bug&quot; to refer to
 46 both bugs and enhancements unless otherwise noted. Hence &quot;fix for a bug&quot; could
 47 also imply &quot;implementation for an enhancement&quot;.
 48 
 49 #. **Discuss the intended change**
 50 
 51    Send an e-mail to the appropriate development mailing list for the Project that
 52    maintains the code. The e-mail should have a subject line of the form:
 53 
 54    &gt;     6543210: My favorite bug
 55 
 56    where `6543210` is replaced with the actual bug id number or
 57    &quot;[NEW BUG]&quot; if the bug id is not known and `My favorite bug` is
 58    replaced with the bug&#39;s summary.  The message should describe the intended
 59    change, which components may be affected, and any other risks or
 60    concerns.
 61 
 62 #. **Does a bug id exist for the work?**
 63 
 64    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 65     Y   Continue
 66 
 67     N   Create a bug in an appropriate component/sub-component.
 68    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 69 
 70 #. **Set the bug status to &quot;Open&quot;**
 71 
 72    This communicates intent to fix the bug to other members of the Project. It
 73    also sets the expectation for downstream teams such as SQE and JCK that the bug
 74    will be fixed in an upcoming integration.
 75 
 76 #. **Does the fix for the bug require a specification change,
 77    directly affect an external interface, or otherwise have a compatibility
 78    impact?**
 79 
 80    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 81     Y   Submission of a CCC request is required. Work may begin after the
 82         request has been [accepted](glossary.html#accepted) by the CCC; the
 83         changeset implementing the fix may be committed to a team forest
 84         after the request has been [approved](glossary.html#approved) by the CCC.
 85         A description of the CCC requirements may be found in
 86         [Review Bodies](reviewBodies.html).
 87 
 88     N   Continue
 89    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 90 
 91 #. **Fix the bug**
 92 
 93    Assuming that the development team approves of the intended approach, begin
 94    working on the code using the latest source available from the appropriate
 95    OpenJDK Project [repository](http://hg.openjdk.java.net).
 96 
 97 #. **Is it possible to write a test to detect the bug?**
 98 
 99    +:-:+:---------------------------------------------------------------------+
100    | Y | For bugs, provide a [jtreg](../jtreg/) regression test               |
101    |   | as part of the changeset. For enhancements that directly affect      |
102    |   | one or more exported interfaces, add an adequate set of jtreg unit   |
103    |   | tests as part of the changeset. By convention all regression and     |
104    |   | unit tests should contain a                                          |
105    |   | [\@bug tag](http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg/tag-spec.html#INFORMATIONAL_TAGS9) |
106    |   | referencing at least one bugid.                                      |
107    |   |                                                                      |
108    |   | An entirely new test (or tests) may not be required. For             |
109    |   | example, if the bug is an existing regression test failure, then     |
110    |   | when fixing the bug you should just add the new bug ID to the list   |
111    |   | of space-delimited bugs in the                                       |
112    |   | [\@bug tag](http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg/tag-spec.html#INFORMATIONAL_TAGS) |
113    |   | of the failing regression test, even if the test did not need to     |
114    |   | be updated.                                                          |
115    +---+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
116    | N | An explanation for why a test is unnecessary or infeasible is        |
117    |   | required.  Such an explanation is recorded by adding a label, and    |
118    |   | possibly a comment, to the bug report.  The label has the prefix     |
119    |   | &quot;noreg&quot; for regression tests and &quot;nounit&quot; for unit tests.  The       |
120    |   | suffixes and their meanings are as follows:                          |
121    |   |                                                                      |
122    |   | **-sqe**                                                             |
123    |   | :    Change can be verified by running an existing SQE test suite;   |
124    |   |      the bug should identify the suite and the specific test case(s). |
125    |   |                                                                      |
126    |   | **-jck**                                                             |
127    |   | :    Change can be verified by running the JCK; the bug should       |
128    |   |      identify the specific test case(s).                             |
129    |   |                                                                      |

131    |   | :    Change can be verified by running an existing external test     |
132    |   |      suite; the bug should identify the suite and the specific test  |
133    |   |      case(s).                                                        |
134    |   |                                                                      |
135    |   | **-doc**                                                             |
136    |   | :    Change only affects documentation.                              |
137    |   |                                                                      |

139    |   | :    Change only affects demo code.                                  |
140    |   |                                                                      |

142    |   | :    Change only affects build infrastructure (makefiles,            |
143    |   |      copyrights, scripts, etc.).                                     |
144    |   |                                                                      |

146    |   | :    Change is a fix to a regression or unit test itself.            |
147    |   |                                                                      |

149    |   | :    Change is for a performance bug for which writing a regression  |
150    |   |      test is infeasible; the bug should describe how to verify the   |
151    |   |      fix.                                                            |
152    |   |                                                                      |
153    |   | **-hard**                                                            |
154    |   | :    It is too hard to write a regression or unit test for this bug  |
155    |   |      (e.g., theoretical race condition, complex setup, reboot        |
156    |   |      required, editing of installed files required, specific         |
157    |   |      graphics card required); the bug should explain why.            |
158    |   |                                                                      |

160    |   | :    Testing requires a very long running time (e.g., more than a    |
161    |   |      few minutes).                                                   |
162    |   |                                                                      |
163    |   | **-big**                                                             |
164    |   | :    Testing requires an unreasonable quantity of resources (e.g.,   |
165    |   |      tens of gigabytes of filesystem space).                         |
166    |   |                                                                      |
167    |   | **-trivial**                                                         |
168    |   | :    Change is so trivial that nothing could possibly go wrong with  |
169    |   |      it.                                                             |
170    |   |                                                                      |
171    |   | **-cleanup**                                                         |
172    |   | :    Change is a cleanup or refactoring of existing code that is     |
173    |   |      covered by existing tests.                                      |
174    |   |                                                                      |

176    |   | :    Change only affects localized text.                             |
177    |   |                                                                      |

179    |   | :    Change is a reversion of a previous faulty change.              |
180    |   |                                                                      |

182    |   | :    Regression or unit test is unnecessary or infeasible for some   |
183    |   |      other reason; the bug report should explain why.                |
184    |   |                                                                      |
185    |   | Examples:  If a bug fix only corrects a change in the build system,  |
186    |   | then add the &quot;noreg-build&quot; label to the corresponding bug. If the    |
187    |   | change improves loop optimizations in HotSpot, then add              |
188    |   | &quot;nounit-perf&quot; to the corresponding bug.                              |

191 #. **Is modification of shared Java code needed?**
192 
193    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
194     Y   It is often sufficient to build and test on a single platform,
195         but sometimes it is not. Use discretion.
196 
197     N   Continue
198    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
199 
200 #. **Is modification of shared C code needed?**
201 
202    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
203     Y   Build and test on at least one instance of all three of the
204         supported operating systems (Solaris, Linux, and
205         Windows).
206 
207     N   Continue
208    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
209 
210 #. **Is modification of C or Java platform-specific code needed?**
211 
212    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
213     Y   Build and test on all relevant platforms.  Code under
214         `src/solaris` builds on Solaris, Linux, and MacOS X
215         despite its name.
216 
217     N   Continue
218    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
219 
220 #. **Run relevant regression and unit tests on all relevant platforms**
221 
222    These include tests for external interfaces as well as other kinds of tests,
223    e.g., HotSpot tests that use internal verification mechanisms. See
224    [Testing Changes](testingChanges.html) for more details.
225 
226 #. **Run relevant JCK tests on all relevant platforms**
227 
228    Running JCK tests is particularly important if the change may have unexpected
229    side-effects. See [JCK Acquisition](jckAcquisition.html) for more details.
230 
231 #. **Request a review of the changes by sending an e-mail to
232 the development alias**
233 
234    A patch can be submitted as described in [Contributing](../contribute/). Alternatively, a
235    [&quot;webrev&quot;](webrevHelp.html) may be generated and
236    uploaded to the [community code review](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/) server.
237    The complete webrev generation and upload procedure is described at
238    [http://cr.openjdk.java.net](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/).
239 
240    Changeset pushes before the
241    [Feature Complete](/projects/jdk8/milestones#Feature_Complete)
242    require at least one [Reviewer](/bylaws#reviewer); pushes after
243    the Feature Complete require at least two Reviewers. In either case, the
244    more the merrier. Some teams may require more Reviewers. Check with
245    members of the Project.
246 
247    Reviewers should examine not only the code being added or
248    changed but also the relevant unit or regression tests.
249 
250    A change may require multiple Reviewers because it affects
251    multiple areas.  Reviewers should be aware that they take full
252    responsibility for the appropriateness and correctness of any changes in
253    their area of expertise.  If something goes wrong (e.g., the build breaks)
254    and the change&amp;apos;s author is unavailable, they may be asked to deal with
255    the problem.  Potential Reviewers are encouraged to refuse to review code
256    for which they are not qualified.
257 
258 #. **Create a changeset**
259 
260    Follow the instructions in [Producing a Changeset](producingChangeset.html).
261 
262 #. **Update the bug content**
263 
264    Bug descriptions and comments should be written
265    in a professional manner.
266 
267 #. **Push the changeset into the Project&#39;s forest**
268 
269    Follow the instructions in [Producing a Changeset](producingChangeset.html).
270    If working with a Sponsor, send the changeset to the
271    development mailing list so that they can handle the final push.
272 
273    The push will trigger a update to the bug which will make the
