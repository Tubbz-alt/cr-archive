13     primary goals are to ensure that the proposed changes are suitable for the
14     release in a general sense and that the requisite JCK and SQE resources will be
15     available.
16 
17 **approved** (by the CCC)
18 :   The stage of the CCC process after &quot;FINAL&quot;. The CCC has approved the final
