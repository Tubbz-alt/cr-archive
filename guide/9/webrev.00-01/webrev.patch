+# OpenJDK Developer's Guide
+
+This Project maintains the [OpenJDK Developers' Guide](https://openjdk.java.net/guide/).
+The goal of this guide is to answer questions that the developers of the JDK might have around
+development process, tooling, standards, etc. The formal rules and processes are described in
+other documents, like [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1) for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal
+& Roadmap Process, or [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3) for the JDK Release Process.
+This guide is meant to be a complement with tutorials and examples for how to follow these rules
+and how to work together with the rest of the OpenJDK community.
+
+There are many common use cases that aren't detailed in the formal process. This guide contains the
+defacto standard for how to work in such cases.
+
+## Audience
+
+The target audience for this document is anyone in the OpenJDK community who aims to contribute
+to the development of OpenJDK. The nature of such a document is to target those who are not
+familiar with the process. People who are regular contributors would already know much of
+what this guide has to offer. Still, the Developers' Guide should work as a source of knowledge also
+for experienced contributors. This means that any descriptions in the Guide should be self-contained
+or have explicit references to any information the reader is expected to already know. The information
+should also be structured in such a way that it's easy to find details for any process, so that
+one who already knows the big picture can quickly find that particular detail that was forgotten.
+
+## Contributing
+
+To engage in the development of the Developers' Guide itself, create a private fork and join
+the dedicated [guide-dev mail list](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/guide-dev).
+
+## Building the Developers' Guide
+
+The project comes with a makefile. Simply type `make` to generate html files from the source
+markdown. The build requires the tools `pandoc`, `Ã¬conv`, and `perl` and assumes a posix environment.
+The resulting html files in the `build` directory are exactly the files published on the
+OpenJDK web server. There is however a larger framework on the web server with fonts and CSS
+that is not part of this project. This means that the html files as they are generated
+will not look exactly the same as the final published version. Still they are hopefully good
+enough to proof read changes and see the layout in a browser.
