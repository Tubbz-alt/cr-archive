  ## Building the Developers&#39; Guide
  
  The project comes with a makefile. Simply type `make` to generate html files from the source
<span class="line-modified">! markdown. The build requires the tools `pandoc`, `Ã¬conv`, and `perl` and assumes a posix environment.</span>
  The resulting html files in the `build` directory are exactly the files published on the
  OpenJDK web server. There is however a larger framework on the web server with fonts and CSS
  that is not part of this project. This means that the html files as they are generated
  will not look exactly the same as the final published version. Still they are hopefully good
  enough to proof read changes and see the layout in a browser.
