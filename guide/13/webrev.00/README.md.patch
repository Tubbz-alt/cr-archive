+markdown. The build requires the tools `pandoc`, `iconv`, and `perl` and assumes a posix environment.
 The resulting html files in the `build` directory are exactly the files published on the
 OpenJDK web server. There is however a larger framework on the web server with fonts and CSS
 that is not part of this project. This means that the html files as they are generated
 will not look exactly the same as the final published version. Still they are hopefully good
 enough to proof read changes and see the layout in a browser.
