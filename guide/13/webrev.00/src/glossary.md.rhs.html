<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified"> 7 [**accepted**]{#accepted} (by the CCC)</span>
 8 :   The stage of the CCC process after &quot;DRAFT&quot;, and &quot;PROPOSED&quot;. At this stage the
 9     primary goals are to ensure that the proposed changes are suitable for the
10     release in a general sense and that the requisite JCK and SQE resources will be
11     available.
12 
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">13 [**approved**]{#approved} (by the CCC)</span>
14 :   The stage of the CCC process after &quot;FINAL&quot;. The CCC has approved the final
15    version of the request which permits push into the project forest.
16 
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a><span class="line-modified">17 [**changeset**]{#changeset}</span>
18 :   A collection of changes with respect to the current clone of a repository.
19 
<a name="4" id="anc4"></a><span class="line-modified">20 [**development freeze**]{#developmentfreeze}</span>
21 :   The date by which all planned work should be complete for a particular line of
22     development. After a line&#39;s development freeze, only exit-criteria bugs may be
23     fixed in that line.
24 
<a name="5" id="anc5"></a><span class="line-modified">25 [**forest**]{#forest}</span>
26 :   A collection of Mercurial repositories which can be managed as a set of nested
27     repositories. The name &quot;Forest&quot; originally came from the Mercurial &quot;Forest
28     Extension&quot; which can be used with some versions of Mercurial, but in general is
29     no longer recommended. The script
30     `common/bin/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply a
31     Mercurial `hg` command to all the repositories in
32     a forest.
33 
<a name="6" id="anc6"></a><span class="line-modified">34 [**Group**]{#group}</span>
35 :   A collection of [Participants](/bylaws#participant) who engage in
36     open conversation about a common interest. That interest may be in the
37     creation, enhancement, or maintenance of a specific body of code or it may lie
38     in other areas, e.g., quality, documentation, or evangelism. See the
39     [Group overview](../groups/).
40 
<a name="7" id="anc7"></a><span class="line-modified">41 [**Mercurial**]{#mercurial}</span>
42 :   A free, cross-platform, distributed source management tool. Source bundles and
43     binary packages for Mercurial are available at
44     [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial).
45     The main Mercurial documentation is available at
46     [http://hgbook.red-bean.com](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/).
47 
<a name="8" id="anc8"></a><span class="line-modified">48 [**Project**]{#project}</span>
49 :   A collaborative effort to produce a specific artifact, which may be a body of
50     code, or documentation, or some other material. See the
51     [Project overview](../projects/).
52 
<a name="9" id="anc9"></a><span class="line-modified">53 [**repository**]{#repository}</span>
54 :   A directory tree in the filesystem that Mercurial treats specially. This tree
55    contains the source files and their revision history.
56 
<a name="10" id="anc10"></a><span class="line-modified">57 [**webrev**]{#webrev}</span>
58 :   A tool and its output. In JDK release forests, the script,
59     [`webrev.ksh`](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/webrev/raw-file/tip/webrev.ksh),
60     examines a forest or repository to generate a set of web-based views of
61     differences.
