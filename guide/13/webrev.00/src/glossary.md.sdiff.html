<span class="line-modified"> 7 **accepted** (by the CCC)</span>
 8 :   The stage of the CCC process after &quot;DRAFT&quot;, and &quot;PROPOSED&quot;. At this stage the
 9     primary goals are to ensure that the proposed changes are suitable for the
10     release in a general sense and that the requisite JCK and SQE resources will be
11     available.
12 
<span class="line-modified">13 **approved** (by the CCC)</span>
14 :   The stage of the CCC process after &quot;FINAL&quot;. The CCC has approved the final
15    version of the request which permits push into the project forest.
16 
<span class="line-modified">17 **changeset**</span>
18 :   A collection of changes with respect to the current clone of a repository.
19 
<span class="line-modified">20 **development freeze**</span>
21 :   The date by which all planned work should be complete for a particular line of
22     development. After a line&#39;s development freeze, only exit-criteria bugs may be
23     fixed in that line.
24 
<span class="line-modified">25 **forest**</span>
26 :   A collection of Mercurial repositories which can be managed as a set of nested
27     repositories. The name &quot;Forest&quot; originally came from the Mercurial &quot;Forest
28     Extension&quot; which can be used with some versions of Mercurial, but in general is
29     no longer recommended. The script
30     `common/bin/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply a
31     Mercurial `hg` command to all the repositories in
32     a forest.
33 
<span class="line-modified">34 **Group**</span>
35 :   A collection of [Participants](/bylaws#participant) who engage in
36     open conversation about a common interest. That interest may be in the
37     creation, enhancement, or maintenance of a specific body of code or it may lie
38     in other areas, e.g., quality, documentation, or evangelism. See the
39     [Group overview](../groups/).
40 
<span class="line-modified">41 **Mercurial**</span>
42 :   A free, cross-platform, distributed source management tool. Source bundles and
43     binary packages for Mercurial are available at
44     [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial).
45     The main Mercurial documentation is available at
46     [http://hgbook.red-bean.com](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/).
47 
<span class="line-modified">48 **Project**</span>
49 :   A collaborative effort to produce a specific artifact, which may be a body of
50     code, or documentation, or some other material. See the
51     [Project overview](../projects/).
52 
<span class="line-modified">53 **repository**</span>
54 :   A directory tree in the filesystem that Mercurial treats specially. This tree
55    contains the source files and their revision history.
56 
<span class="line-modified">57 **webrev**</span>
58 :   A tool and its output. In JDK release forests, the script,
59     [`webrev.ksh`](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/webrev/raw-file/tip/webrev.ksh),
60     examines a forest or repository to generate a set of web-based views of
61     differences.
