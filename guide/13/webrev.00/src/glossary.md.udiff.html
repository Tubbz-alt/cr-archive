<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- **accepted** (by the CCC)</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ [**accepted**]{#accepted} (by the CCC)</span>
  :   The stage of the CCC process after &quot;DRAFT&quot;, and &quot;PROPOSED&quot;. At this stage the
      primary goals are to ensure that the proposed changes are suitable for the
      release in a general sense and that the requisite JCK and SQE resources will be
      available.
  
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- **approved** (by the CCC)</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ [**approved**]{#approved} (by the CCC)</span>
  :   The stage of the CCC process after &quot;FINAL&quot;. The CCC has approved the final
     version of the request which permits push into the project forest.
  
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- **changeset**</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ [**changeset**]{#changeset}</span>
  :   A collection of changes with respect to the current clone of a repository.
  
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- **development freeze**</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ [**development freeze**]{#developmentfreeze}</span>
  :   The date by which all planned work should be complete for a particular line of
      development. After a line&#39;s development freeze, only exit-criteria bugs may be
      fixed in that line.
  
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- **forest**</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ [**forest**]{#forest}</span>
  :   A collection of Mercurial repositories which can be managed as a set of nested
      repositories. The name &quot;Forest&quot; originally came from the Mercurial &quot;Forest
      Extension&quot; which can be used with some versions of Mercurial, but in general is
      no longer recommended. The script
      `common/bin/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply a
      Mercurial `hg` command to all the repositories in
      a forest.
  
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- **Group**</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ [**Group**]{#group}</span>
  :   A collection of [Participants](/bylaws#participant) who engage in
      open conversation about a common interest. That interest may be in the
      creation, enhancement, or maintenance of a specific body of code or it may lie
      in other areas, e.g., quality, documentation, or evangelism. See the
      [Group overview](../groups/).
  
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- **Mercurial**</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ [**Mercurial**]{#mercurial}</span>
  :   A free, cross-platform, distributed source management tool. Source bundles and
      binary packages for Mercurial are available at
      [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial).
      The main Mercurial documentation is available at
      [http://hgbook.red-bean.com](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/).
  
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- **Project**</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ [**Project**]{#project}</span>
  :   A collaborative effort to produce a specific artifact, which may be a body of
      code, or documentation, or some other material. See the
      [Project overview](../projects/).
  
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- **repository**</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ [**repository**]{#repository}</span>
  :   A directory tree in the filesystem that Mercurial treats specially. This tree
     contains the source files and their revision history.
  
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- **webrev**</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ [**webrev**]{#webrev}</span>
  :   A tool and its output. In JDK release forests, the script,
      [`webrev.ksh`](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/webrev/raw-file/tip/webrev.ksh),
      examines a forest or repository to generate a set of web-based views of
      differences.
