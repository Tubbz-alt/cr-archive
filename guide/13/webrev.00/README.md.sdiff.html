14 ## Audience
15 
16 The target audience for this document is anyone in the OpenJDK community who aims to contribute
17 to the development of OpenJDK. The nature of such a document is to target those who are not
18 familiar with the process. People who are regular contributors would already know much of
19 what this guide has to offer. Still, the Developers&#39; Guide should work as a source of knowledge also
20 for experienced contributors. This means that any descriptions in the Guide should be self-contained
21 or have explicit references to any information the reader is expected to already know. The information
22 should also be structured in such a way that it&#39;s easy to find details for any process, so that
23 one who already knows the big picture can quickly find that particular detail that was forgotten.

30 ## Building the Developers&#39; Guide
31 
32 The project comes with a makefile. Simply type `make` to generate html files from the source
<span class="line-modified">33 markdown. The build requires the tools `pandoc`, `Ã¬conv`, and `perl` and assumes a posix environment.</span>
34 The resulting html files in the `build` directory are exactly the files published on the
35 OpenJDK web server. There is however a larger framework on the web server with fonts and CSS
36 that is not part of this project. This means that the html files as they are generated
37 will not look exactly the same as the final published version. Still they are hopefully good
38 enough to proof read changes and see the layout in a browser.
