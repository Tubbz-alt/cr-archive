 The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work.
+All participation in an OpenJDK project starts with joining the project mailing
+list. All OpenJDK mailing lists are found here:
+
+> [`mail.openjdk.java.net`](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo)
+
+The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it's important to
+keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global.
+Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists.
+Even though English is the required language for all lists, many participants
+speak other languages as their mother tongue. A high tolerance for non-perfect
+English is expected from anyone joining these lists.
+
+You must be in the list to send to the list. Some lists are moderated to keep the
+content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older
+conversations on the list.
+
+There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what
+the list is intended for, `<project>-<suffix>`, where the first part is the project
+that owns the list and the second part is explained below.
+
+> `-dev`
+> :    Technical discussions around the implementation of the project artifacts. This
+       is also where code reviews happen.
+
+> `-use`
+> :    Technical discussions around the usage of the project artifacts.
+
+> `-discuss`
+> :    General discussions around the project. The special case `discuss(at)openjdk.java.net`
+       is used for general discussions around the OpenJDK project. Discussions around new
+       project proposals usually happens here.
+
+>  `-changes`
+> :    Changeset notifications from the source code repositories maintained by the project.
+
+> `-announce`
+> :    General project announcements. These lists are tightly moderated and are
+       expected to be low traffic. The special case `announce(at)openjdk.java.net`
+       is used for announcements for the OpenJDK project.
+
+> `-comments`
+> :    Expert group comments around the project.
+
+> `-experts`
+> :    Expert group discussions (moderated).
+
+> `-observers`
+> :    List used to follow and comment on the discussions in the corresponding `-experts` list.
+
 
-This section will contain a pointer to the existing
-[mailing list page](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo)
-and any associated infrastructure. It will describe the
-naming conventions, for instance _&ast;-dev_ and
-_&ast;-discuss_ and other suffixes such as those for code
-review requests, changeset notifications, and automatic bug updates as these
-services become available.
