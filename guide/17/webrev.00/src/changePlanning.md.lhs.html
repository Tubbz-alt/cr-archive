  7 This section describes the development process of identifying a bug or
  8 enhancement (formerly &quot;Request for Enhancement&quot; (RFE)) and providing a
  9 solution. The instructions assume that the
 10 [Contributor](/bylaws#contributor) already has a
 11 working build environment and has some familiarity with an existing OpenJDK
 12 [Project](bylaws#_6) and its repositories.
 13 
 14 Three classes of changes are treated in separate sections:
 15 
 16 * [Fixing a Bug](#fixing-a-bug) provides a step-by-step
 17 workflow for fixing a simple bug. Of particular note is the list of
 18 [noreg bug labels](#noreg) for changes which do not have regression tests.
 19 * [Adding an API](#adding-an-api) is TBD.
 20 * [Adding a Feature/JSR](#adding-a-featurejsr) is TBD.
 21 
 22 ## Fixing a Bug
 23 
 24 This is the list of steps which should be performed when fixing a small bug.
 25 Small bugs include typos in code or specification, algorithm improvements for
 26 correctness or performance, and code changes required to correctly implement
 27 the specification.
 28 
 29 &gt; ---
 30 &gt; Some steps refer to operations which can not be performed directly without the
 31 &gt; assistance of a [Project Committer](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer).
 32 &gt; For example, any changes to the
 33 &gt; [bug database](http://bugs.openjdk.java.net) fall into
 34 &gt; this category. Since these steps are required,
 35 &gt; [Contributors](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#contributor)
 36 &gt; are urged to work with their [Sponsors](/sponsor/)
 37 &gt; to complete these tasks.
 38 
 39 &gt; ---
 40 
 41 For the purposes of brevity this document will use the term &quot;bug&quot; to refer to
 42 both bugs and enhancements unless otherwise noted. Hence &quot;fix for a bug&quot; could
 43 also imply &quot;implementation for an enhancement&quot;.
 44 
 45 #. **Discuss the intended change**
 46 
 47    Send an e-mail to the appropriate development mailing list for the Project that
 48    maintains the code. The e-mail should have a subject line of the form:
 49 
 50    &gt;     6543210: My favorite bug
 51 
 52    where `6543210` is replaced with the actual bug id number or
 53    &quot;[NEW BUG]&quot; if the bug id is not known and `My favorite bug` is
 54    replaced with the bug&#39;s summary.  The message should describe the intended
 55    change, which components may be affected, and any other risks or
 56    concerns.
 57 
 58 #. **Does a bug id exist for the work?**
 59 
 60    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 61     Y   Continue
 62 
 63     N   Create a bug in an appropriate component/sub-component.
 64    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 65 
 66 #. **Set the bug status to &quot;Open&quot;**
 67 
 68    This communicates intent to fix the bug to other members of the Project. It
 69    also sets the expectation for downstream teams such as SQE and JCK that the bug
 70    will be fixed in an upcoming integration.
 71 
 72 #. **Does the fix for the bug require a specification change,
 73    directly affect an external interface, or otherwise have a compatibility
 74    impact?**
 75 
 76    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified"> 77     Y   Submission of a CCC request is required. Work may begin after the</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 78         request has been [accepted](glossary.html#accepted) by the CCC; the</span>
 79         changeset implementing the fix may be committed to a team forest

 86 
 87 #. **Fix the bug**
 88 
 89    Assuming that the development team approves of the intended approach, begin
 90    working on the code using the latest source available from the appropriate
 91    OpenJDK Project [repository](http://hg.openjdk.java.net).
 92 
 93 #. **Is it possible to write a test to detect the bug?**
 94 
 95    +:-:+:---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 96    | Y | For bugs, provide a [jtreg](../jtreg/) regression test               |
 97    |   | as part of the changeset. For enhancements that directly affect      |
 98    |   | one or more exported interfaces, add an adequate set of jtreg unit   |
 99    |   | tests as part of the changeset. By convention all regression and     |
100    |   | unit tests should contain a                                          |
101    |   | [\@bug tag](http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg/tag-spec.html#INFORMATIONAL_TAGS9) |
102    |   | referencing at least one bugid.                                      |
103    +---+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
104    |   | An entirely new test (or tests) may not be required. For             |
105    |   | example, if the bug is an existing regression test failure, then     |
106    |   | when fixing the bug you should just add the new bug ID to the list   |
107    |   | of space-delimited bugs in the                                       |
108    |   | [\@bug tag](http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg/tag-spec.html#INFORMATIONAL_TAGS) |
109    |   | of the failing regression test, even if the test did not need to     |
110    |   | be updated.                                                          |
111    +---+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
112    | N | An explanation for why a test is unnecessary or infeasible is        |
113    |   | required.  Such an explanation is recorded by adding a label, and    |
114    |   | possibly a comment, to the bug report.  The label has the prefix     |
115    |   | &quot;noreg&quot; for regression tests and &quot;nounit&quot; for unit tests.  The       |
116    |   | suffixes and their meanings are as follows:                          |
117    +---+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
118    |   | [**-sqe**]{#noreg-sqe}                                               |
119    |   | :    Change can be verified by running an existing SQE test suite;   |
120    |   |      the bug should identify the suite and the specific test case(s).|
121    |   |                                                                      |

123    |   | :    Change can be verified by running the JCK; the bug should       |
124    |   |      identify the specific test case(s).                             |
125    |   |                                                                      |

127    |   | :    Change can be verified by running an existing external test     |
128    |   |      suite; the bug should identify the suite and the specific test  |
129    |   |      case(s).                                                        |
130    |   |                                                                      |

132    |   | :    Change only affects documentation.                              |
133    |   |                                                                      |

135    |   | :    Change only affects demo code.                                  |
136    |   |                                                                      |

138    |   | :    Change only affects build infrastructure (makefiles,            |
139    |   |      copyrights, scripts, etc.).                                     |

141    |   | [**-self**]{#noreg-self}                                             |
142    |   | :    Change is a fix to a regression or unit test itself.            |
143    |   |                                                                      |

145    |   | :    Change is for a performance bug for which writing a regression  |
146    |   |      test is infeasible; the bug should describe how to verify the   |
147    |   |      fix.                                                            |
148    |   |                                                                      |
149    |   | [**-hard**]{#noreg-hard}                                             |
150    |   | :    It is too hard to write a regression or unit test for this bug  |
151    |   |      (e.g., theoretical race condition, complex setup, reboot        |
152    |   |      required, editing of installed files required, specific         |
153    |   |      graphics card required); the bug should explain why.            |
154    |   |                                                                      |

156    |   | :    Testing requires a very long running time (e.g., more than a    |
157    |   |      few minutes).                                                   |
158    |   |                                                                      |
159    |   | [**-big**]{#noreg-big}                                               |
160    |   | :    Testing requires an unreasonable quantity of resources (e.g.,   |
161    |   |      tens of gigabytes of filesystem space).                         |
162    |   |                                                                      |
163    |   | [**-trivial**]{#noreg-trivial}                                       |
164    |   | :    Change is so trivial that nothing could possibly go wrong with  |
165    |   |      it.                                                             |
166    |   |                                                                      |
167    |   | [**-cleanup**]{#noreg-cleanup}                                       |
168    |   | :    Change is a cleanup or refactoring of existing code that is     |
169    |   |      covered by existing tests.                                      |
170    |   |                                                                      |
171    |   | [**-l10n**]{#noreg-l10n}                                             |
172    |   | :    Change only affects localized text.                             |
173    |   |                                                                      |

175    |   | :    Change is a reversion of a previous faulty change.              |
176    |   |                                                                      |

178    |   | :    Regression or unit test is unnecessary or infeasible for some   |
179    |   |      other reason; the bug report should explain why.                |
180    |   |                                                                      |
181    |   | Examples:  If a bug fix only corrects a change in the build system,  |
182    |   | then add the &quot;noreg-build&quot; label to the corresponding bug. If the    |
183    |   | change improves loop optimizations in HotSpot, then add              |
184    |   | &quot;nounit-perf&quot; to the corresponding bug.                              |

187 #. **Is modification of shared Java code needed?**
188 
189    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
190     Y   It is often sufficient to build and test on a single platform,
191         but sometimes it is not. Use discretion.
192 
193     N   Continue
194    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
195 
196 #. **Is modification of shared C code needed?**
197 
198    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
199     Y   Build and test on at least one instance of all three of the
200         supported operating systems (Solaris, Linux, and
201         Windows).
202 
203     N   Continue
204    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
205 
206 #. **Is modification of C or Java platform-specific code needed?**
207 
208    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
209     Y   Build and test on all relevant platforms.  Code under
210         `src/solaris` builds on Solaris, Linux, and MacOS X
211         despite its name.
212 
213     N   Continue
214    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
215 
216 #. **Run relevant regression and unit tests on all relevant platforms**
217 
218    These include tests for external interfaces as well as other kinds of tests,
219    e.g., HotSpot tests that use internal verification mechanisms. See
220    [Testing Changes](testingChanges.html) for more details.
221 
222 #. **Run relevant JCK tests on all relevant platforms**
223 
224    Running JCK tests is particularly important if the change may have unexpected
225    side-effects. See [JCK Acquisition](jckAcquisition.html) for more details.
226 
227 #. **Request a review of the changes by sending an e-mail to
228 the development alias**
229 
230    A patch can be submitted as described in [Contributing](../contribute/). Alternatively, a
231    [&quot;webrev&quot;](webrevHelp.html) may be generated and
232    uploaded to the [community code review](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/) server.
233    The complete webrev generation and upload procedure is described at
234    [http://cr.openjdk.java.net](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/).
235 
236    Changeset pushes before the
237    [Feature Complete](/projects/jdk8/milestones#Feature_Complete)
238    require at least one [Reviewer](/bylaws#reviewer); pushes after
239    the Feature Complete require at least two Reviewers. In either case, the
240    more the merrier. Some teams may require more Reviewers. Check with
241    members of the Project.
242 
243    Reviewers should examine not only the code being added or
244    changed but also the relevant unit or regression tests.
245 
246    A change may require multiple Reviewers because it affects
247    multiple areas.  Reviewers should be aware that they take full
248    responsibility for the appropriateness and correctness of any changes in
249    their area of expertise.  If something goes wrong (e.g., the build breaks)
250    and the change&amp;apos;s author is unavailable, they may be asked to deal with
251    the problem.  Potential Reviewers are encouraged to refuse to review code
252    for which they are not qualified.
253 
254 #. **Create a changeset**
255 
256    Follow the instructions in [Producing a Changeset](producingChangeset.html).
257 
258 #. **Update the bug content**
259 
260    Bug descriptions and comments should be written
261    in a professional manner.
262 
263 #. **Push the changeset into the Project&#39;s forest**
264 
265    Follow the instructions in [Producing a Changeset](producingChangeset.html).
266    If working with a Sponsor, send the changeset to the
267    development mailing list so that they can handle the final push.
268 
269    The push will trigger a update to the bug which will make the
270    following changes:
271     
272     * Set the bug&#39;s &quot;Status&quot; to &quot;Resolved&quot; and &quot;Resolution to &quot;Fixed&quot;.
273     * Set the bug&#39;s &quot;Fix Version/s&quot; to an appropriate release.
274     * Set the bug&#39;s &quot;Resolved in Build&quot; to &quot;team&quot;.
275     * Add a Comment containing a reference to the changeset.
276
