  The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work.
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ All participation in an OpenJDK project starts with joining the project mailing</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ list. All OpenJDK mailing lists are found here:</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; [`mail.openjdk.java.net`](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo)</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it&#39;s important to</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ Even though English is the required language for all lists, many participants</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ speak other languages as their mother tongue. A high tolerance for non-perfect</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ English is expected from anyone joining these lists.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ You must be in the list to send to the list. Some lists are moderated to keep the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ conversations on the list.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ the list is intended for, `&lt;project&gt;-&lt;suffix&gt;`, where the first part is the project</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ that owns the list and the second part is explained below.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; `-dev`</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; :    Technical discussions around the implementation of the project artifacts. This</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+        is also where code reviews happen.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; `-use`</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; :    Technical discussions around the usage of the project artifacts.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; `-discuss`</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; :    General discussions around the project. The special case `discuss(at)openjdk.java.net`</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+        is used for general discussions around the OpenJDK project. Discussions around new</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+        project proposals usually happens here.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt;  `-changes`</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; :    Changeset notifications from the source code repositories maintained by the project.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; `-announce`</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; :    General project announcements. These lists are tightly moderated and are</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+        expected to be low traffic. The special case `announce(at)openjdk.java.net`</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+        is used for announcements for the OpenJDK project.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; `-comments`</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; :    Expert group comments around the project.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; `-experts`</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; :    Expert group discussions (moderated).</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; `-observers`</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &gt; :    List used to follow and comment on the discussions in the corresponding `-experts` list.</span>
