  The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it&#39;s important to
  keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global.
  Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists.
  Even though English is the required language for all lists, many participants
<span class="line-modified">! speak other languages as their mother tongue. A high tolerance for non-perfect</span>
  English is expected from anyone joining these lists.
  
  You must be in the list to send to the list. Some lists are moderated to keep the
  content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older
  conversations on the list.
