 7 The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work.
 8 All participation in an OpenJDK project starts with joining the project mailing
 9 list. All OpenJDK mailing lists are found here:
10 
11 &gt; [`mail.openjdk.java.net`](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo)
12 
13 The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it&#39;s important to
14 keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global.
15 Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists.
16 Even though English is the required language for all lists, many participants
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified">17 speak other languages as their native language. A high tolerance for non-perfect</span>
18 English is expected from anyone joining these lists.
19 
20 You must be in the list to send to the list. Some lists are moderated to keep the
21 content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older
22 conversations on the list.
23 
24 There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what
25 the list is intended for, `&lt;project&gt;-&lt;suffix&gt;`, where the first part is the project
26 that owns the list and the second part is explained below.
27 
28 &gt; `-dev`
29 &gt; :    Technical discussions around the implementation of the project artifacts. This
30        is also where code reviews happen.
31 
32 &gt; `-use`
33 &gt; :    Technical discussions around the usage of the project artifacts.
34 
35 &gt; `-discuss`
36 &gt; :    General discussions around the project. The special case `discuss(at)openjdk.java.net`
37        is used for general discussions around the OpenJDK project. Discussions around new
38        project proposals usually happens here.
39 
40 &gt;  `-changes`
41 &gt; :    Changeset notifications from the source code repositories maintained by the project.
42 
43 &gt; `-announce`
44 &gt; :    General project announcements. These lists are tightly moderated and are
45        expected to be low traffic. The special case `announce(at)openjdk.java.net`
46        is used for announcements for the OpenJDK project.

48 &gt; `-experts`
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a><span class="line-modified">49 &gt; :    Expert group discussions. The list is restricted; only members of the expert</span>
<span class="line-added">50        group can subscribe.</span>
51 
52 &gt; `-observers`
<a name="4" id="anc4"></a><span class="line-modified">53 &gt; :    Open for anyone to subscribe to see what the experts are discussing and potentially</span>
<span class="line-modified">54        to have some dialog with other non-experts. There is no guarantee that an expert is</span>
<span class="line-added">55        subscribed to the `-observers` list or will see any responses on that list.</span>
56 
<a name="5" id="anc5"></a><span class="line-added">57 &gt; `-comments`</span>
<span class="line-added">58 &gt; :    Used by observers to directly provide feedback/comments to the experts (typically</span>
<span class="line-added">59        a lead will process the comments list and forward things on to the experts list).</span>
