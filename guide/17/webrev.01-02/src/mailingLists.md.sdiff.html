13 The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it&#39;s important to
14 keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global.
15 Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists.
16 Even though English is the required language for all lists, many participants
17 speak other languages as their native language. A high tolerance for non-perfect
18 English is expected from anyone joining these lists.

20 You must be in the list to send to the list. Some lists are moderated to keep the
21 content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older
22 conversations on the list.

38        project proposals usually happens here.

41 &gt; :    Changeset notifications from the source code repositories maintained by the project.
42 
43 &gt; `-announce`
