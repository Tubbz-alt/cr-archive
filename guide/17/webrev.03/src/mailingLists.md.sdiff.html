 7 The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work.
<span class="line-added"> 8 All participation in an OpenJDK project starts with joining the relevant mailing</span>
<span class="line-added"> 9 list. A subscriber to an OpenJDK mailing list is referred to as a Participant</span>
<span class="line-added">10 in the [Bylaws](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws). As a general recommendation we suggest</span>
<span class="line-added">11 to subscribe to [announce](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/announce),</span>
<span class="line-added">12 [discuss](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/discuss), and the `-dev` lists</span>
<span class="line-added">13 covering your explicit area of interest. All OpenJDK mailing lists are found here:</span>
14 
<span class="line-modified">15 &gt; [`mail.openjdk.java.net`](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo)</span>
<span class="line-modified">16 </span>
<span class="line-modified">17 The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it&#39;s important to</span>
<span class="line-modified">18 keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global.</span>
<span class="line-modified">19 Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists.</span>
<span class="line-modified">20 Even though English is the required language for all lists, many Participants</span>
<span class="line-modified">21 speak other languages as their native language. A high tolerance for non-perfect</span>
<span class="line-added">22 English is expected from anyone joining these lists.</span>
<span class="line-added">23 </span>
<span class="line-added">24 You must be in the list to send to the list. Some lists are moderated to keep the</span>
<span class="line-added">25 content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older</span>
<span class="line-added">26 conversations on the list.</span>
<span class="line-added">27 </span>
<span class="line-added">28 There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what</span>
<span class="line-added">29 the list is intended for, `&lt;name&gt;-&lt;suffix&gt;`. The name often refers to the project</span>
<span class="line-added">30 that owns the list or a specific area of interest that the list focuses on.</span>
<span class="line-added">31 The suffix is explained below. Not all projects or areas have all types of</span>
<span class="line-added">32 lists described here.</span>
<span class="line-added">33 </span>
<span class="line-added">34 &gt; `-dev`</span>
<span class="line-added">35 &gt; :    Technical discussions around the implementation of the project artifacts. This</span>
<span class="line-added">36        is also where code reviews happen.</span>
<span class="line-added">37 </span>
<span class="line-added">38 &gt; `-use`</span>
<span class="line-added">39 &gt; :    Technical discussions around the usage of the project artifacts.</span>
<span class="line-added">40 </span>
<span class="line-added">41 &gt; `-discuss`</span>
<span class="line-added">42 &gt; :    General discussions around the project. The special case `discuss(at)openjdk.java.net`</span>
<span class="line-added">43        is used for general discussions around the OpenJDK project. Discussions around new</span>
<span class="line-added">44        project proposals usually happens here.</span>
<span class="line-added">45 </span>
<span class="line-added">46 &gt;  `-changes`</span>
<span class="line-added">47 &gt; :    Changeset notifications from the source code repositories maintained by the project.</span>
<span class="line-added">48 </span>
<span class="line-added">49 &gt; `-announce`</span>
<span class="line-added">50 &gt; :    General project announcements. These lists are tightly moderated and are</span>
<span class="line-added">51        expected to be low traffic. The special case `announce(at)openjdk.java.net`</span>
<span class="line-added">52        is used for announcements for the OpenJDK project.</span>
<span class="line-added">53 </span>
<span class="line-added">54 &gt; `-experts`</span>
<span class="line-added">55 &gt; :    Expert group discussions. The list is restricted; only members of the expert</span>
<span class="line-added">56        group can subscribe.</span>
<span class="line-added">57 </span>
<span class="line-added">58 &gt; `-observers`</span>
<span class="line-added">59 &gt; :    Open for anyone to subscribe to see what the experts are discussing and potentially</span>
<span class="line-added">60        to have some dialog with other non-experts. There is no guarantee that an expert is</span>
<span class="line-added">61        subscribed to the `-observers` list or will see any responses on that list.</span>
<span class="line-added">62 </span>
<span class="line-added">63 &gt; `-comments`</span>
<span class="line-added">64 &gt; :    Used by observers to directly provide feedback/comments to the experts (typically</span>
<span class="line-added">65        a lead will process the comments list and forward things on to the experts list).</span>
