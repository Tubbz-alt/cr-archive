 7 The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work.
 8 All participation in an OpenJDK project starts with joining the relevant mailing
<span class="line-modified"> 9 list. All OpenJDK mailing lists are found here:</span>




10 
11 &gt; [`mail.openjdk.java.net`](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo)
12 
13 The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it&#39;s important to
14 keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global.
15 Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists.
<span class="line-modified">16 Even though English is the required language for all lists, many participants</span>
17 speak other languages as their native language. A high tolerance for non-perfect
18 English is expected from anyone joining these lists.
19 
20 You must be in the list to send to the list. Some lists are moderated to keep the
21 content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older
22 conversations on the list.
23 
24 There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what
25 the list is intended for, `&lt;name&gt;-&lt;suffix&gt;`. The name often refers to the project
26 that owns the list or a specific area of interest that the list focuses on.
27 The suffix is explained below. Not all projects or areas have all types of
28 lists described here.
29 
30 &gt; `-dev`
31 &gt; :    Technical discussions around the implementation of the project artifacts. This
32        is also where code reviews happen.
33 
34 &gt; `-use`
35 &gt; :    Technical discussions around the usage of the project artifacts.
