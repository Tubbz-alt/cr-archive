 7 The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work.
<span class="line-added"> 8 All participation in an OpenJDK project starts with joining the project mailing</span>
<span class="line-added"> 9 list. All OpenJDK mailing lists are found here:</span>
10 
<span class="line-modified">11 &gt; [`mail.openjdk.java.net`](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo)</span>
<span class="line-modified">12 </span>
<span class="line-modified">13 The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it&#39;s important to</span>
<span class="line-modified">14 keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global.</span>
<span class="line-modified">15 Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists.</span>
<span class="line-modified">16 Even though English is the required language for all lists, many participants</span>
<span class="line-modified">17 speak other languages as their native language. A high tolerance for non-perfect</span>
<span class="line-added">18 English is expected from anyone joining these lists.</span>
<span class="line-added">19 </span>
<span class="line-added">20 You must be in the list to send to the list. Some lists are moderated to keep the</span>
<span class="line-added">21 content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older</span>
<span class="line-added">22 conversations on the list.</span>
<span class="line-added">23 </span>
<span class="line-added">24 There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what</span>
<span class="line-added">25 the list is intended for, `&lt;project&gt;-&lt;suffix&gt;`, where the first part is the project</span>
<span class="line-added">26 that owns the list and the second part is explained below.</span>
<span class="line-added">27 </span>
<span class="line-added">28 &gt; `-dev`</span>
<span class="line-added">29 &gt; :    Technical discussions around the implementation of the project artifacts. This</span>
<span class="line-added">30        is also where code reviews happen.</span>
<span class="line-added">31 </span>
<span class="line-added">32 &gt; `-use`</span>
<span class="line-added">33 &gt; :    Technical discussions around the usage of the project artifacts.</span>
<span class="line-added">34 </span>
<span class="line-added">35 &gt; `-discuss`</span>
<span class="line-added">36 &gt; :    General discussions around the project. The special case `discuss(at)openjdk.java.net`</span>
<span class="line-added">37        is used for general discussions around the OpenJDK project. Discussions around new</span>
<span class="line-added">38        project proposals usually happens here.</span>
<span class="line-added">39 </span>
<span class="line-added">40 &gt;  `-changes`</span>
<span class="line-added">41 &gt; :    Changeset notifications from the source code repositories maintained by the project.</span>
<span class="line-added">42 </span>
<span class="line-added">43 &gt; `-announce`</span>
<span class="line-added">44 &gt; :    General project announcements. These lists are tightly moderated and are</span>
<span class="line-added">45        expected to be low traffic. The special case `announce(at)openjdk.java.net`</span>
<span class="line-added">46        is used for announcements for the OpenJDK project.</span>
<span class="line-added">47 </span>
<span class="line-added">48 &gt; `-experts`</span>
<span class="line-added">49 &gt; :    Expert group discussions. The list is restricted; only members of the expert</span>
<span class="line-added">50        group can subscribe.</span>
<span class="line-added">51 </span>
<span class="line-added">52 &gt; `-observers`</span>
<span class="line-added">53 &gt; :    Open for anyone to subscribe to see what the experts are discussing and potentially</span>
<span class="line-added">54        to have some dialog with other non-experts. There is no guarantee that an expert is</span>
<span class="line-added">55        subscribed to the `-observers` list or will see any responses on that list.</span>
<span class="line-added">56 </span>
<span class="line-added">57 &gt; `-comments`</span>
<span class="line-added">58 &gt; :    Used by observers to directly provide feedback/comments to the experts (typically</span>
<span class="line-added">59        a lead will process the comments list and forward things on to the experts list).</span>
