 7 The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work.
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-added"> 8 All participation in an OpenJDK project starts with joining the relevant mailing</span>
<span class="line-added"> 9 list. All OpenJDK mailing lists are found here:</span>

<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">11 &gt; [`mail.openjdk.java.net`](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo)</span>
<span class="line-modified">12 </span>
<span class="line-modified">13 The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it&#39;s important to</span>
<span class="line-modified">14 keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global.</span>
<span class="line-modified">15 Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists.</span>
<span class="line-modified">16 Even though English is the required language for all lists, many participants</span>
<span class="line-modified">17 speak other languages as their native language. A high tolerance for non-perfect</span>
<span class="line-added">18 English is expected from anyone joining these lists.</span>
<span class="line-added">19 </span>
<span class="line-added">20 You must be in the list to send to the list. Some lists are moderated to keep the</span>
<span class="line-added">21 content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older</span>
<span class="line-added">22 conversations on the list.</span>
<span class="line-added">23 </span>
<span class="line-added">24 There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what</span>
<span class="line-added">25 the list is intended for, `&lt;name&gt;-&lt;suffix&gt;`. The name often refers to the project</span>
<span class="line-added">26 that owns the list or a specific area of interest that the list focuses on.</span>
<span class="line-added">27 The suffix is explained below. Not all projects or areas have all types of</span>
<span class="line-added">28 lists described here.</span>
<span class="line-added">29 </span>
<span class="line-added">30 &gt; `-dev`</span>
<span class="line-added">31 &gt; :    Technical discussions around the implementation of the project artifacts. This</span>
<span class="line-added">32        is also where code reviews happen.</span>
<span class="line-added">33 </span>

<span class="line-added">44 </span>
<span class="line-added">45 &gt; `-announce`</span>
<span class="line-added">46 &gt; :    General project announcements. These lists are tightly moderated and are</span>
<span class="line-added">47        expected to be low traffic. The special case `announce(at)openjdk.java.net`</span>

<span class="line-added">54 &gt; `-observers`</span>
<span class="line-added">55 &gt; :    Open for anyone to subscribe to see what the experts are discussing and potentially</span>
<span class="line-added">56        to have some dialog with other non-experts. There is no guarantee that an expert is</span>
<span class="line-added">57        subscribed to the `-observers` list or will see any responses on that list.</span>
<span class="line-added">58 </span>

<span class="line-added">60 &gt; :    Used by observers to directly provide feedback/comments to the experts (typically</span>
<span class="line-added">61        a lead will process the comments list and forward things on to the experts list).</span>
