 7 This is a set of code conventions for JDK Release Projects in the OpenJDK Community. Other OpenJDK Projects, and projects outside of OpenJDK, are welcome to adopt these guidelines as they see fit.
 8 
 9 ## Motivation
10 Code that looks familiar is easier to understand and therefore also easier to review, debug and maintain. To ensure that code looks familiar to all developers on the project it’s important to agree on a common set of conventions.
11 
12 This section provides guidelines for low level coding practices such as how to indent code and how to name types and variables. Many of the stylistic choices are subjective and different developers may have different opinions about them. Keep in mind however, that having a consistent style is more important than to satisfy each individual developers preference.

14 ## Guiding Principles
15 The guidelines in this section strive to maximize,
16 
17 #. Correctness
18 #. Readability
19 #. Maintainability
20 #. Debuggability
21 #. Consistency
22 #. Aesthetics

<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-added">24 While this section covers a lot of ground, it should be noted that no style guide can answer all questions for us, and developers will always need to use good judgment towards the end of producing code that is correct, readable, maintainable, debuggable, consistently formatted, and aesthetically pleasing.</span>
<span class="line-added">25 </span>
<span class="line-added">26 Examples in this section are non-normative; While they intend to illustrate a correct way of formatting the code, there may be other ways to correctly format the code. This is a general principle: There may be several ways to format the code, all adhering to the guidelines in this section.</span>
<span class="line-added">27 </span>
<span class="line-added">28 Tool support is nice, but ultimately each IDE and style checking tool can handle different sets of rules, and support for rules that can’t be handled today might be added in future versions. So, whether a rule plays well with tools or not can be a factor, but it’s secondary to the above principles.</span>
