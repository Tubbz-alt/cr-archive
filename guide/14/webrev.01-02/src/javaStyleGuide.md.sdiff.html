<span class="line-removed">   7 While this section covers a lot of ground, it should be noted that no style guide can answer all questions for us, and developers will always need to use good judgment towards the end of producing code that is correct, readable, maintainable, debuggable, consistently formatted, and aesthetically pleasing.</span>
<span class="line-removed">   8 </span>
<span class="line-removed">   9 Examples in this section are non-normative; While they intend to illustrate correct way of formatting the code, there may be other ways to correctly format the code. This is a general principle: There may be several ways to format the code, all adhering to the guidelines in this section.</span>
<span class="line-removed">  10 </span>
<span class="line-removed">  11 Tool support is nice, but ultimately each IDE and style checking tool can handle different sets of rules, and support for rules that can’t be handled today might be added in future versions. So, whether a rule plays well with tools or not can be a factor, but it’s secondary to the above principles.</span>

  45 ## Java Source Files
<span class="line-removed">  46 This section concerns ordinary `.java` files only. Rules do not necessarily apply to other source files such as `.jasm`, `.sh` or `.gmk`.</span>
  47 
  48 ::: conventions
  49 - Source files must be encoded in 7-bit ASCII.
  50 - All lines must be terminated with a line feed character (`LF`, ASCII value 10) and *not* for instance `CR` or `CR`+`LF`.
  51 - There may be no trailing white space at the end of a line.
  52 - The name of a source file must equal the name of the class it contains followed by the `.java` extension, even for files that only contain a package private class. This does not apply to files that do not contain any class declarations, such as `package-info.java`.
  53 :::
  54 
  55 ::: box
  56 [Motivation]{.boxheader}
  57 7-bit ASCII reduces errors due to confusion of characters since there are no invisible spaces, characters that look like minus signs but are really dashes, etc. It also ensures packages and classes are named in such way that the corresponding directories and source files are portable across different filesystems.
  58   
  59 Agreeing on a common line delimiter character is important since different operating systems have different defaults. Editing a file on Windows that was originally written on Linux, may cause all `LF` to be saved back as `CR`+`LF`. This creates unnecessarily big patches and may not display correctly in the text editor it was originally written in. A single line feed character is default for Unix-like systems and supported by all common text editors and IDEs.
  60 
  61 Trailing white space is nothing but unnecessary cruft. It’s easy to remove and agreeing on doing so consistently minimizes diffs.
  62 
  63 Not using the name of the class as filename can be confusing. Also, unless the file is given explicitly to the compiler, the class it contains may not be resolved correctly.
