  ## Building the Developers&#39; Guide
  
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- The project comes with a makefile. Simply type `make` to generate html files from the source</span>

<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- The resulting html files in the `build` directory are exactly the files published on the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- OpenJDK web server. There is however a larger framework on the web server with fonts and CSS</span>

  enough to proof read changes and see the layout in a browser.
