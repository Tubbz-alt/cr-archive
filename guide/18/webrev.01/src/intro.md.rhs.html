 7 Welcome to the OpenJDK Developers&#39; Guide!

<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified"> 9 The OpenJDK Community is the place to collaborate on open-source implementations</span>
<span class="line-modified">10 of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects.  It was created in</span>
<span class="line-modified">11 November 2006, when initial portions of the JDK source code were published under</span>
<span class="line-modified">12 the GPLv2 license.</span>
13 
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">14 In order to work together efficiently, clear directions are sometimes needed to</span>
15 avoid misconceptions and to align developers&#39; views of terminology and process.
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a><span class="line-modified">16 The OpenJDK Community is a fairly pragmatic place. &quot;Do the right thing&quot; is most</span>
17 often the right course of action. Still, if people do things in the same right way
<a name="4" id="anc4"></a><span class="line-modified">18 then everyone&#39;s work becomes more transparent and easier for others to follow. For</span>
19 this reason most parts of the development process have standard flows that are the
20 recommended ways to do things.
21 
<a name="5" id="anc5"></a><span class="line-modified">22 The goal of this guide is to answer questions that developers of the JDK might</span>
<span class="line-modified">23 have around development process, tooling, standards, and so forth. The formal rules and</span>
<span class="line-modified">24 processes are described in other documents, such as [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1)</span>
<span class="line-modified">25 for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal &amp; Roadmap Process, and [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3)</span>
<span class="line-modified">26 for the JDK Release Process. This guide is meant to be a complement to such documents,</span>
<span class="line-modified">27 with tutorials and examples for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest</span>
<span class="line-modified">28 of the OpenJDK Community.</span>
29 
30 There are many common use cases that aren&#39;t detailed in the formal process. This
<a name="6" id="anc6"></a><span class="line-modified">31 guide suggests how to work in such cases.</span>
