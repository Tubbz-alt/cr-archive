<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- OpenJDK was created when the JDK was first released under the GPLv2 license in May</span>

<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ The OpenJDK Community is the place to collaborate on open-source implementations</span>

<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ November 2006, when initial portions of the JDK source code were published under</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ the GPLv2 license.</span>
