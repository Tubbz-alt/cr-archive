<span class="line-modified">! # OpenJDK Developer&#39;s Guide</span>
  
  This Project maintains the [OpenJDK Developers&#39; Guide](https://openjdk.java.net/guide/).
<span class="line-modified">! The goal of this guide is to answer questions that the developers of the JDK might have around</span>
<span class="line-modified">! development process, tooling, standards, etc. The formal rules and processes are described in</span>
<span class="line-modified">! other documents, like [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1) for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal</span>
<span class="line-modified">! &amp; Roadmap Process, or [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3) for the JDK Release Process.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! This guide is meant to be a complement with tutorials and examples for how to follow these rules</span>
<span class="line-modified">! and how to work together with the rest of the OpenJDK community.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">! There are many common use cases that aren&#39;t detailed in the formal process. This guide contains the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! defacto standard for how to work in such cases.</span>
  
  ## Audience
  
<span class="line-modified">! The target audience for this document is anyone in the OpenJDK community who aims to contribute</span>
<span class="line-modified">! to the development of OpenJDK. The nature of such a document is to target those who are not</span>
<span class="line-modified">! familiar with the process. People who are regular contributors would already know much of</span>
  what this guide has to offer. Still, the Developers&#39; Guide should work as a source of knowledge also
<span class="line-modified">! for experienced contributors. This means that any descriptions in the Guide should be self-contained</span>
<span class="line-modified">! or have explicit references to any information the reader is expected to already know. The information</span>
<span class="line-modified">! should also be structured in such a way that it&#39;s easy to find details for any process, so that</span>
<span class="line-modified">! one who already knows the big picture can quickly find that particular detail that was forgotten.</span>

  ## Building the Developers&#39; Guide
  
<span class="line-modified">! The project comes with a makefile. Simply type `make` to generate html files from the source</span>
<span class="line-modified">! markdown. The build requires the tools `pandoc`, `iconv`, and `perl` and assumes a posix environment.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! The resulting html files in the `build` directory are exactly the files published on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! OpenJDK web server. There is however a larger framework on the web server with fonts and CSS</span>
<span class="line-modified">! that is not part of this project. This means that the html files as they are generated</span>
  will not look exactly the same as the final published version. Still they are hopefully good
  enough to proof read changes and see the layout in a browser.
