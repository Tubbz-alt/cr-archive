 1 # OpenJDK Developers&#39; Guide
 2 
 3 This Project maintains the [OpenJDK Developers&#39; Guide](https://openjdk.java.net/guide/).
 4 The goal of this guide is to answer questions that developers of the JDK might have around
 5 development process, tooling, standards, and so forth. The formal rules and processes are described in
 6 other documents, such as [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1) for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal
 7 &amp; Roadmap Process, and [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3) for the JDK Release Process.
 8 This guide is meant to be a complement to such documents, with tutorials and examples
 9 for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest of the OpenJDK Community.
10 
11 There are many common use cases that aren&#39;t detailed in the formal process. This guide suggests
12 how to work in such cases.
13 
14 ## Audience
15 
16 The target audience for this document is anyone in the OpenJDK Community who aims to contribute
17 to the development of the JDK but is not yet
18 familiar with the process. People who are already regular contributors will already know much of
19 what this guide has to offer. Still, the Developers&#39; Guide should work as a source of knowledge also
20 for experienced contributors. Any descriptions in the Guide should thus be self-contained
21 or have explicit references to any information thata the reader is expected to already know. The information
22 should also be structured in such a way that it&#39;s easy to find the details for any process, so that
23 a reader who already knows the big picture can quickly find a particular detail that was forgotten.
24 
25 ## Contributing
26 
27 To engage in the development of the Developers&#39; Guide itself, create a private fork and join
28 the dedicated [guide-dev mail list](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/guide-dev).

30 ## Building the Developers&#39; Guide
31 
32 The project comes with a `Makefile`. Simply type `make` to generate HTML files from the source
33 Markdown. The build requires the tools `pandoc`, `iconv`, and `perl` and assumes a POSIX environment.
34 The resulting HTML files in the `build` directory are exactly the files published on the
35 [OpenJDK web server](https://openjdk.java.net/guide/). There is, however, a larger framework
36 on the web server with fonts and CSS
37 that is not part of this project. This means that the HTML files as they are generated
38 will not look exactly the same as the final published version. Still they are hopefully good
39 enough to proof read changes and see the layout in a browser.
