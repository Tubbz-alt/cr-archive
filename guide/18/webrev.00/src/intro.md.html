 7 Welcome to the OpenJDK Developers&#39; Guide!
 8 
 9 The OpenJDK Community is the place to collaborate on open-source implementations
10 of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects.  It was created in
11 November 2006, when initial portions of the JDK source code were published under
12 the GPLv2 license.
13 
14 In order to work together efficiently, clear directions are sometimes needed to
15 avoid misconceptions and to align developers&#39; views of terminology and process.
16 The OpenJDK Community is a fairly pragmatic place. &quot;Do the right thing&quot; is most
17 often the right course of action. Still, if people do things in the same right way
18 then everyone&#39;s work becomes more transparent and easier for others to follow. For
19 this reason most parts of the development process have standard flows that are the
20 recommended ways to do things.
21 
22 The goal of this guide is to answer questions that developers of the JDK might
23 have around development process, tooling, standards, and so forth. The formal rules and
24 processes are described in other documents, such as [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1)
25 for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal &amp; Roadmap Process, and [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3)
26 for the JDK Release Process. This guide is meant to be a complement to such documents,
27 with tutorials and examples for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest
28 of the OpenJDK Community.
29 
30 There are many common use cases that aren&#39;t detailed in the formal process. This
31 guide suggests how to work in such cases.
