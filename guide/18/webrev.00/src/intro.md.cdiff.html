  Welcome to the OpenJDK Developers&#39; Guide!
  
<span class="line-modified">! OpenJDK is the place to collaborate on an open-source implementation</span>
<span class="line-modified">! of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! OpenJDK was created when the JDK was first released under the GPLv2 license in May</span>
<span class="line-modified">! 2007 and since then a community has grown around it to help develop and maintain Java.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">! In order to work together efficiently clear directions are sometimes needed to</span>
  avoid misconceptions and to align developers&#39; views of terminology and process.
<span class="line-modified">! The OpenJDK community is a fairly pragmatic place. &quot;Do what&#39;s right&quot; is most</span>
  often the right course of action. Still, if people do things in the same right way
<span class="line-modified">! everyone&#39;s work becomes more transparent and easier for others to follow. For</span>
  this reason most parts of the development process have standard flows that are the
  recommended ways to do things.
  
<span class="line-modified">! The goal of this guide is to answer questions that the developers of the JDK might</span>
<span class="line-modified">! have around development process, tooling, standards, etc. The formal rules and</span>
<span class="line-modified">! processes are described in other documents, like [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1)</span>
<span class="line-modified">! for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal &amp; Roadmap Process, or [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3)</span>
<span class="line-modified">! for the JDK Release Process. This guide is meant to be a complement with tutorials</span>
<span class="line-modified">! and examples for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest</span>
<span class="line-modified">! of the OpenJDK community.</span>
  
  There are many common use cases that aren&#39;t detailed in the formal process. This
<span class="line-modified">! guide contains the defacto standard for how to work in such cases.</span>

  Welcome to the OpenJDK Developers&#39; Guide!
  
<span class="line-modified">! The OpenJDK Community is the place to collaborate on open-source implementations</span>
<span class="line-modified">! of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects.  It was created in</span>
<span class="line-modified">! November 2006, when initial portions of the JDK source code were published under</span>
<span class="line-modified">! the GPLv2 license.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">! In order to work together efficiently, clear directions are sometimes needed to</span>
  avoid misconceptions and to align developers&#39; views of terminology and process.
