 7 Welcome to the OpenJDK Developers&#39; Guide!
 8 
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified"> 9 OpenJDK is the place to collaborate on an open-source implementation</span>
<span class="line-modified">10 of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects.</span>
<span class="line-modified">11 OpenJDK was created when the JDK was first released under the GPLv2 license in May</span>
<span class="line-modified">12 2007 and since then a community has grown around it to help develop and maintain Java.</span>
13 
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">14 In order to work together efficiently clear directions are sometimes needed to</span>
15 avoid misconceptions and to align developers&#39; views of terminology and process.
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a><span class="line-modified">16 The OpenJDK community is a fairly pragmatic place. &quot;Do what&#39;s right&quot; is most</span>
17 often the right course of action. Still, if people do things in the same right way
<a name="4" id="anc4"></a><span class="line-modified">18 everyone&#39;s work becomes more transparent and easier for others to follow. For</span>
19 this reason most parts of the development process have standard flows that are the
20 recommended ways to do things.
21 
<a name="5" id="anc5"></a><span class="line-modified">22 The goal of this guide is to answer questions that the developers of the JDK might</span>
<span class="line-modified">23 have around development process, tooling, standards, etc. The formal rules and</span>
<span class="line-modified">24 processes are described in other documents, like [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1)</span>
<span class="line-modified">25 for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal &amp; Roadmap Process, or [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3)</span>
<span class="line-modified">26 for the JDK Release Process. This guide is meant to be a complement with tutorials</span>
<span class="line-modified">27 and examples for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest</span>
<span class="line-modified">28 of the OpenJDK community.</span>
29 
30 There are many common use cases that aren&#39;t detailed in the formal process. This
<a name="6" id="anc6"></a><span class="line-modified">31 guide contains the defacto standard for how to work in such cases.</span>
