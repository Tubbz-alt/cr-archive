11 **accepted** (by the CCC)
12 :   The stage of the CCC process after &quot;DRAFT&quot;, and &quot;PROPOSED&quot;. At this stage the
13     primary goals are to ensure that the proposed changes are suitable for the
14     release in a general sense and that the requisite JCK and SQE resources will be
15     available.
16 
17 **approved** (by the CCC)
18 :   The stage of the CCC process after &quot;FINAL&quot;. The CCC has approved the final
19    version of the request which permits push into the project forest.
20 
21 **changeset**
22 :   A collection of changes with respect to the current clone of a repository.
23 
24 **development freeze**
25 :   The date by which all planned work should be complete for a particular line of
26     development. After a line&#39;s development freeze, only exit-criteria bugs may be
27     fixed in that line.
28 
29 **forest**
30 :   A collection of Mercurial repositories which can be managed as a set of nested
31     repositories. The name &quot;Forest&quot; originally came from the Mercurial &quot;Forest
32     Extension&quot; which can be used with some versions of Mercurial, but in general is
33     no longer recommended. The script
34     `common/bin/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply a
35     Mercurial `hg` command to all the repositories in
36     a forest.
37 
38 **Group**
39 :   A collection of [Participants](/bylaws#participant) who engage in
40     open conversation about a common interest. That interest may be in the
41     creation, enhancement, or maintenance of a specific body of code or it may lie
42     in other areas, e.g., quality, documentation, or evangelism. See the
43     [Group overview](../groups/).
44 
45 **Mercurial**
46 :   A free, cross-platform, distributed source management tool. Source bundles and
47     binary packages for Mercurial are available at
48     [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial).
49     The main Mercurial documentation is available at
50     [http://hgbook.red-bean.com](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/).
51 
52 **Project**
53 :   A collaborative effort to produce a specific artifact, which may be a body of
54     code, or documentation, or some other material. See the
55     [Project overview](../projects/).
56 
57 **repository**
58 :   A directory tree in the filesystem that Mercurial treats specially. This tree
59    contains the source files and their revision history.
60 
61 **webrev**
62 :   A tool and its output. In JDK release forests, the script,
63     [`webrev.ksh`](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/webrev/raw-file/tip/webrev.ksh),
64     examines a forest or repository to generate a set of web-based views of
65     differences.
