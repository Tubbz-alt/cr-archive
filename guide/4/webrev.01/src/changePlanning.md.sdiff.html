 11 This section describes the development process of identifying a bug or
 12 enhancement (formerly &quot;Request for Enhancement&quot; (RFE)) and providing a
 13 solution. The instructions assume that the
 14 [Contributor](/bylaws#contributor) already has a
 15 working build environment and has some familiarity with an existing OpenJDK
 16 [Project](bylaws#_6) and its repositories.

102    |   | one or more exported interfaces, add an adequate set of jtreg unit   |
103    |   | tests as part of the changeset. By convention all regression and     |
104    |   | unit tests should contain a                                          |

108    |   | An entirely new test (or tests) may not be required. For             |
109    |   | example, if the bug is an existing regression test failure, then     |
110    |   | when fixing the bug you should just add the new bug ID to the list   |
111    |   | of space-delimited bugs in the                                       |

117    |   | required.  Such an explanation is recorded by adding a label, and    |
118    |   | possibly a comment, to the bug report.  The label has the prefix     |
119    |   | &quot;noreg&quot; for regression tests and &quot;nounit&quot; for unit tests.  The       |
