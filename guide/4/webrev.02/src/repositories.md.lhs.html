 11 This section describes the OpenJDK repository terminology and naming scheme. It
 12 also includes minimal instructions to acquire source from the OpenJDK
 13 repository,
 14 [`http://hg.openjdk.java.net/`](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/).
 15 
 16 &gt; ---
 17 &gt; Note that source may be available from other locations, for example
 18 &gt; `src.zip` from a full JDK distribution. However,
 19 &gt; OpenJDK contributions must use source from the
 20 &gt; [OpenJDK Mercurial repository](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/)
 21 &gt; since other source distributions may contain older code
 22 &gt; or code which differs due to licensing.
 23 
 24 &gt; ---
 25 
 26 Operations which are performed repeatedly, such as creating changesets,
 27 merging, and pushing are described in [Producing a Changeset](producingChangeset.html).
 28 
 29 * [Terminology and Naming Scheme](#terminology-and-naming-scheme) defines the
 30 nomenclature used by OpenJDK.
 31 * [Installing and Configuring Mercurial](#installing-and-configuring) enumerates the required software, provides links for
 32 download, and describes basic installation and configuration.
 33 * [Cloning](#clone) covers the procedure for
 34 obtaining private copies of source repositories.
 35 
 36 This document assumes familiarity with the first two chapters of the free
 37 on-line book [Mercurial: The Definitive Guide](http://hgbook.red-bean.com).
 38 
 39 ## Terminology and Naming Scheme
 40 
 41 The OpenJDK code base for all
 42 [Projects](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#_6) is
 43 stored in Mercurial repositories which contain the source files and their
 44 change history. Some Projects may choose to organize their code into multiple,
 45 possibly related, Mercurial repositories. For instance,
 46 [JDK 9](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9)
 47 uses a forest of multiple related repositories which contain components of the
 48 entire JDK. Projects which are based on the JDK, such as
 49 [IcedTea](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/icedtea)
 50 and
 51 [Jigsaw](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw)
 52 also use this model. In contrast,
 53 [Code Tools](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools) uses an unrelated repository for each tool and
 54 [Graal](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/graal)
 55 uses only a single repository. Regardless of how a Project has chosen to store
 56 their code, each
 57 [Contributor](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#contributor)
 58 clones the repository associated with the code they are modifying.
 59 
 60 &gt; ---
 61 &gt; Consult the Project&#39;s documentation or
 62 &gt; [mailing list](http://mail.openjdk.java.net) to
 63 &gt; determine the appropriate repository, development conventions, and helpful
 64 &gt; tools.
 65 
 66 &gt; ---
 67 
 68 This is the typical development model:
 69 
 70 ::: {style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;}
 71 ![Diagram of server repos and user&#39;s clone](devModel.gif)
 72 :::
 73 
 74 A Contributor creates a _clone_ (a local copy called
 75 &quot;9dev&quot;) of a read/write repository (&quot;jdk9/dev&quot;) which resides on the OpenJDK
 76 Mercurial server. They work on their change in the clone and locally
 77 _commit_ a changeset. After the new changeset(s) are
 78 verified, they&#39;re either _pushed_ directly from the
 79 clone or _exported_ and delivered to a
 80 [Committer](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer)
 81 who can perform the push into the server repository for all to see.
 82 
 83 &gt; ---
 84 &gt; The use of _gate repositories_ was eliminated when the
 85 &gt; Mercurial servers were upgraded in March 2014.
 86 
 87 &gt; ---
 88 
 89 The repositories use the following naming scheme:
 90 
 91 &gt; `&lt;project&gt;/&lt;component_path&gt;`
 92 
 93 where
 94 
 95 &gt; ------------------  ----  ----------------------------------------------------
 96 &gt; _project_            ::   the short name of an OpenJDK [Project](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#_6) such as &quot;jdk9&quot;, &quot;openjfx&quot;, or &quot;sumatra&quot;
 97 &gt; _component_path_     ::   the path to a repository containing the code base as designated by the [Project Lead](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#project-lead).
 98 &gt; ------------------  ----  ----------------------------------------------------
 99 
100 ## Installing and Configuring Mercurial
101 
102 Mercurial is a free, cross-platform, distributed source management tool. Source
103 bundles and binary packages for Mercurial are available at
104 [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial).
105 The OpenJDK repositories recommend installation of Mercurial 2.6.3 (or later).
106 A Mercurial installation is sufficient to clone a repository. Contributors who
107 wish to submit changes will need some additional configuration as described
108 below.
109 
110 Some Projects may recommend additional tools or scripts that help with
111 repository manipulation and code development. For instance, in JDK 9, the
112 utility script `common/bin/hgforest.sh` may be
113 used to apply commands to all the repositories in the
114 [forest](glossary.html#forest). Popular extensions for OpenJDK developers include
115 [jcheck](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/),
116 [trees](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/trees/), and
117 [Mercurial Queues](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/managing-change-with-mercurial-queues.html)
118 (mq). Note that `trees` is enabled on the OpenJDK Mercurial server.
119 
120 Create and edit the `~/.hgrc` file to minimally contain the following entry:
121 
122 &gt;     [ui]
123 &gt;     username = &lt;openjdk_username&gt;
124 
125 _openjdk\_username_ is a plain lowercase, alphanumeric
126 token (not an e-mail address) with twelve characters or less. The first
127 character should be alphabetic. This username will be publicly visible in all
128 Mercurial changeset logs. It will be used to verify that the changeset author
129 is at least an
130 [Author](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#author)
131 for the Project and that the person pushing the changeset is at least a
132 [Committer](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer).
133 It is recommended that the _openjdk\_username_ be
134 somehow related to the Author&#39;s full name, such as the first character of the
135 Author&#39;s first name followed by the Author&#39;s last name. Refer to the
136 [Becoming an Author](../projects/index.html#project-author) section of the
137 [Project](../projects/index.html) page for
138 additional information.
139 
140 An alphabetical list of all of the assigned
141 _openjdk\_usernames_ may be found on the
142 [OpenJDK people](http://db.openjdk.java.net/people) list. The
143 [Census](../census) shows the structure of the OpenJDK Community.
144 
145 #### Verifying the Configuration
146 
147 After installing and configuring Mercurial, validate the configuration using
148 the following steps.
149 
150 #. Verify that Mercurial is version 2.6.3 (or newer).
151 
152    &gt;     $ hg version
153    &gt;     Mercurial Distributed SCM (version 2.9)
154    &gt;     (see http://mercurial.selenic.com for more information)
155    &gt;
156    &gt;     Copyright (C) 2005-2014 Matt Mackall and others
157    &gt;     This is free software; see the source for copying conditions. There is NO
158    &gt;     warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
159 
160 #. Verify that the list of enabled extensions includes fetch and mq.
161 
162    &gt;     $ hg help
163    &gt; [full output](hgHelp.html)
164 
165 #. Verify that the `~/.hgrc` configuration looks correct. Minimally it should contain the following entries:
166 
167    &gt;     $ hg showconfig
168    &gt;     ui.username=iris
169 
170 At this point, it should be possible to start retrieving source from the
171 repositories.
172 
173 ## Cloning
174 
175 With Mercurial each developer works with a clone of the repository which is a
176 snapshot of the files at the time the clone was taken. To update the clone, see
177 [Producing a Changeset](producingChangeset.html).
178 
179 #### ... a Sandbox Repository {#cloneSandbox}
180 
181 In addition to the Project repositories, there are some test repositories that
182 may be used to run test commands against Mercurial without fear of causing
183 damage to development source. Use them freely but with discretion; content in
184 them may be deleted at any time.
185 
186 &gt;     $ mkdir sandbox; cd sandbox
187 &gt;     $ hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/sandbox/box
188 &gt;     destination directory: box
189 &gt;     requesting all changes
190 &gt;     adding changesets
191 &gt;     adding manifests
192 &gt;     adding file changes
193 &gt;     added 23 changesets with 24 changes to 5 files
194 &gt;     4 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
195 &gt;     $ du -s box
196 &gt;     46      box
197 
198 #### ... a Forest {#cloneForest}
199 
200 If a Project uses a forest, It is strongly recommended for developers to clone
201 an entire forest, rather than a single repository. This is the only means to
202 ensure consistency in builds. The following examples illustrate two
203 alternatives for cloning the entire _jdk9/dev_ forest
204 into the directory `9dev`.
205 
206 #. To clone the forest using the
207 [trees](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/trees/)
208 extension just use `tclone`:
209 
210    &gt;     $ hg tclone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev 9dev
211    &gt; [full output](tClone.html)
212 
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">213 #. To clone the forest using `get\_source.sh`, first</span>
214 clone the main tree:
215 
216    &gt;     $ hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev 9dev
217    &gt;     requesting all changes
218    &gt;     adding changesets
219    &gt;     adding manifests
220    &gt;     adding file changes
221    &gt;     added 997 changesets with 1477 changes to 138 files
222    &gt;     updating to branch default
223    &gt;     82 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
224 
225    Then clone the repositories in the forest:
226 
227    &gt;     $ cd 9dev
228    &gt;     $ sh ./get_source.sh
229    &gt; [full output](getSource.html)
230 
231 Regardless of how the forest was cloned, this is the resulting populated
232 forest.
233 
234 &gt;     $ du -s
235 &gt;     934532  .
236 &gt;     $ ls
237 &gt;     ASSEMBLY_EXCEPTION  hotspot    LICENSE   README-builds.html
238 &gt;     common              jaxp       make      test
239 &gt;     configure           jaxws      Makefile  THIRD_PARTY_README
240 &gt;     corba               jdk        nashorn
241 &gt;     get_source.sh       langtools  README
242 
243 #### ... a Single Repository {#cloneSingle}
244 
245 If the source for the Project is contained within a single repository or
246 reading a limited portion of the source is the only goal, it is possible to
247 clone a single repository (even if it&#39;s part of a forest). For instance, this
248 example shows how to clone the `langtools`
249 repository from _jdk9/dev_ into the default
250 destination directory.
251 
252 &gt;     $ hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev/langtools
253 &gt;     destination directory: langtools
254 &gt;     requesting all changes
255 &gt;     adding changesets
256 &gt;     adding manifests
257 &gt;     adding file changes
258 &gt;     added 2289 changesets with 21194 changes to 7004 files
259 &gt;     updating to branch default
260 &gt;     6212 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
261 &gt;     $ du -s langtools
262 &gt;     84396   langtools
