136 ProblemListing and `@ignore`-ing are done in the JDK source tree, that means a check-in into the repository is needed. This in turn means that a unique JBS issue and a code review are needed. This is a good thing since it makes test problems visible.
137 
138 * **Code review**: This is considered a [trivial](glossary.html#trivial) change.
139 * **JBS issue**: A JBS issue is obviously created for the bug that caused the failure, we call this the _main issue_. To exclude the test, create a subtask to the main issue. Also add the label `problemlist` to the main issue.
140 
141 The fix for the main issue should remove the test from the ProblemList or remove the `@ignore` keyword from the test.
142 
143 #### Triage excluded issues
144 
145 After a failure is handled by excluding a test, the main JBS issue should be re-triaged and possibly given a new priority. This should be handled by the standard triage process. A test exclusion results in an outage in our testing. This outage should be taken into consideration when triaging, in addition to the impact of the bug itself.
146 
147 ## Backing Out a Change
148 
149 If a change causes a regression that can&#39;t be fixed within reasonable time the best way to handle the regression can be to back out the change. Backing out means that the inverse (anti-delta) of the change is pushed to effectively undo the change in the repository. There are two parts to this task, how to do the bookkeeping in JBS, and how to do the actual backout in mercurial.
150 
151 The backout is a regular change and will have to go through the standard code review process, but is considered a [trivial](glossary.html#trivial) change. The rationale is that a backout is usually urgent in nature and the change itself is automatically created by hg, and reviewed by the person who is performing the backout, so even though only one additional Reviewer is required the change will in practice get two reviews.
152 
153 ### How to work with JBS when a change is backed out
154 


155 #. If the intention is to fix the change and submit it again, create a redo-issue **(R)** to track that the work still needs to be done.
<span class="line-modified">156    * Clone the original JBS issue **(O)** and add the prefix `[REDO]` on the summary - the clone becomes the redo-issue **(R)**.</span>
157    * Make sure relevant information is brought to **(R)**.
158    * Remember that comments are not brought over when cloning.
159 #. Create a backout-issue **(B)**:
160    * Alternative 1 - the regression is identified directly.
161      * Create a sub-task to **(R)** with the same summary, prefix with `[BACKOUT]`.
162    * Alternative 2 - an investigation issue is created **(I)**, and during the investigation backing out the change is identified as the best solution.
163      * Use the investigation issue **(I)** for the backout.
164      * Change summary of **(I)** to the same as **(O)** and prefix with `[BACKOUT]`.
165      * Move and change type of **(I)** to become a sub-task of **(R)**.
166    * Alternative 3 - no redo issue was created.
167      * Create a backout-issue **(B)** with the same summary as **(O)**, prefix with `[BACKOUT]`.
168      * Link **(B)** and **(O)**.
169 
170 ProblemList entries and `@ignore` keywords will continue to point to the original bug (unless updated at back out). This is accepted since there is a clone link to follow.
171 
172 ### How to work with mercurial when a change is backed out
173 
174 In order to backout a change, the `hg backout` command is recommended, which essentially applies the anti delta of the change. Make sure you perform the backout in the most upstream repostiory the change has escaped to.
