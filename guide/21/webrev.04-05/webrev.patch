 The backout is a regular change and will have to go through the standard code review process, but is considered a [trivial](glossary.html#trivial) change. The rationale is that a backout is usually urgent in nature and the change itself is automatically created by hg, and reviewed by the person who is performing the backout, so even though only one additional Reviewer is required the change will in practice get two reviews.
 
 ### How to work with JBS when a change is backed out
 
+#. Close the original JBS issue **(O)**.
+   * "Verify" the issue and choose "Fix Failed".
 #. If the intention is to fix the change and submit it again, create a redo-issue **(R)** to track that the work still needs to be done.
-   * Clone the original JBS issue **(O)** and add the prefix `[REDO]` on the summary - the clone becomes the redo-issue **(R)**.
+   * Clone **(O)** and add the prefix `[REDO]` on the summary - the clone becomes the redo-issue **(R)**.
    * Make sure relevant information is brought to **(R)**.
    * Remember that comments are not brought over when cloning.
 #. Create a backout-issue **(B)**:
    * Alternative 1 - the regression is identified directly.
      * Create a sub-task to **(R)** with the same summary, prefix with `[BACKOUT]`.
