 19 ## Filing a Bug
 20 
 21 When a new failure is found in the JDK a bug should be filed to describe and track the issue. Depending on your role in the OpenJDK you can either use the [Bug Report Tool](https://bugreport.java.com/) or, if you are Author in an OpenJDK Project, report the bug directly in the [JDK Bug System](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/). Try to make the bug report as complete as possible to make it easier to triage and investigate the bug. It&#39;s not the reporter&#39;s responsibility to set a correct priority, but a good guess is always better than a default value. To help with setting the right priority consider things like how the bug impacts the product and our testing, how likely is it that the bug triggers, and how difficult is it to work around the bug if it&#39;s not fixed soon.
 22 
 23 A few things to keep in mind when filing a new bug:
 24 
 25 * Before filing a bug, verify that there isn&#39;t already a bug filed for this issue.
<span class="line-modified"> 26 * Add relevant labels like `intermittent`, `regression`, `testbug` etc.</span>
 27 * Set affects version to the JDK version(s) where the failure was seen.
 28 * In the description, always include (if possible):
 29   * full name of the failing tests
 30   * error messages
 31   * assert messages
 32   * stack trace
 33   * command line information
 34   * relevant information from the logs
 35 * Only set CPU and/or OS fields if the bug **ONLY** happens on that particular platform.
 36 * Always file separate bugs for different issues.
 37   * If two crashes looks related but not similar enough to for sure be the same, it is easier to close a bug as a duplicate than it is to extract the relevant info from a bug to create a new one later.
 38 
 39 ## ProblemListing or `@ignore`-ing a Test
 40 
 41 Sometimes tests break. It could be due to bugs in the test itself, or due to changed functionality in the code that the test is testing. While working on a fix, it can be useful to stop the test from being executed in everyone else&#39;s testing to reduce noise, especially if the test is expected to fail for more than a day. There are two ways to stop a test from being run in standard test runs: ProblemListing and using the `@ignore` keyword. Removing tests isn&#39;t the standard way to remove a failure. A failing test is expected to be a regression and should ideally be handled promptly with high urgency.
 42 
 43 I&#39;ll say it right away so that it&#39;s not forgotten at the end: Remember to remove the JBS id from the ProblemList or the test when the bug is closed. This is especially easy to forget if a bug is closed as a duplicate or &#39;Will Not Fix&#39;.

 45 ### ProblemListing jtreg tests

 63 test/lib-test/ProblemList.txt
 64 ~~~
 65 
 66 Use the suitable ProblemList and add a line like this in the proper section:
 67 
 68 ~~~
<span class="line-modified"> 69 sun.tools.jcmd.MyTest.java                        4711   windows-all</span>
 70 ~~~
 71 
 72 In this example, `MyTest.java` is ProblemListed on windows, tracked by bug `JDK-4711`.
 73 
 74 Currently there&#39;s [no support for multiple lines for the same test](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/CODETOOLS-7902481). For this reason it&#39;s important to always make sure there&#39;s no existing entry for the test before adding a new one, as multiple entries might lead to unexpected results, e.g.
 75 
 76 ~~~
<span class="line-modified"> 77 sun.tools.jcmd.MyTest.java                        4710   generic-all</span>
 78 ...
<span class="line-modified"> 79 sun.tools.jcmd.MyTest.java                        4711   windows-all</span>
 80 ~~~
 81 
 82 This would lead to `sun.tools.jcmd.MyTest.java` being ProblemListed only on `windows-all`. The proper way to write this is:
 83 
 84 ~~~
<span class="line-modified"> 85 sun.tools.jcmd.MyTest.java                        4710,4711   generic-all,windows-all</span>
 86 ~~~
 87 
 88 Although `windows-all` isn&#39;t strictly required in this example, it&#39;s preferable to specify platforms for each bugid (unless they are all `generic-all`), this makes it easier to remove one of the bugs from the list.
 89 





















 90 #### Running ProblemListed tests
 91 
 92 To run ad-hoc runs of ProblemListed tests use `RUN_PROBLEM_LISTS=true`.
 93 
 94 ~~~
 95 make test TEST=... JTREG=RUN_PROBLEM_LISTS=true
 96 ~~~
 97 
 98 ### Exclude jtreg tests using `@ignore`
 99 
100 The `@ignore` keyword is used in the test source code. This is mainly used for tests that are so broken that they may be harmful or useless. Examples can be tests that don&#39;t compile because something changed in the platform; or a test which might remove your `/etc/shadow`. Use `@ignore` with a bug reference in the test case to prevent the test from being run.
101 
102 ~~~java
103 /**
104  *  @test
105  *  @ignore 4711
106  *
107 ~~~
108 
109 In this example, `MyTest.java` is excluded, tracked by bug `JDK-4711`. `@ignore` should always be placed directly before the first `@run` line in the test.
