 7 The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work.
 8 All participation in an OpenJDK project starts with joining the relevant mailing
 9 list. A subscriber to an OpenJDK mailing list is referred to as a Participant
10 in the [Bylaws](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws). As a general recommendation we suggest
<span class="line-modified">11 to subscribe to [announce](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/announce),</span>
<span class="line-modified">12 [discuss](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/discuss), and the `-dev` lists</span>

17 The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it&#39;s important to
18 keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global.
19 Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists.
20 Even though English is the required language for all lists, many Participants

22 English is expected from anyone joining these lists.

24 You must be in the list to send to the list. Some lists are moderated to keep the
25 content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older
26 conversations on the list.

28 There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what
29 the list is intended for, `&lt;name&gt;-&lt;suffix&gt;`. The name often refers to the project
30 that owns the list or a specific area of interest that the list focuses on.
31 The suffix is explained below. Not all projects or areas have all types of
32 lists described here.
