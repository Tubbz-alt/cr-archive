  7 This section describes the OpenJDK repository terminology and naming scheme. It
  8 also includes minimal instructions to acquire source from the OpenJDK
  9 repository,

 11 
 12 &gt; ---
 13 &gt; Note that source may be available from other locations, for example
 14 &gt; `src.zip` from a full JDK distribution. However,
 15 &gt; OpenJDK contributions must use source from the
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified"> 16 &gt; [OpenJDK Mercurial repository](https://hg.openjdk.java.net/)</span>
 17 &gt; since other source distributions may contain older code
 18 &gt; or code which differs due to licensing.

 34 
 35 ## Terminology and Naming Scheme
 36 
 37 The OpenJDK code base for all
<a name="4" id="anc4"></a><span class="line-modified"> 38 [Projects](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#_6) is</span>
 39 stored in Mercurial repositories which contain the source files and their
 40 change history. Some Projects may choose to organize their code into multiple,
 41 possibly related, Mercurial repositories. For instance,
<a name="5" id="anc5"></a><span class="line-modified"> 42 [JDK 9](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9)</span>
 43 uses a forest of multiple related repositories which contain components of the
 44 entire JDK. Projects which are based on the JDK, such as
<a name="6" id="anc6"></a><span class="line-modified"> 45 [IcedTea](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/icedtea)</span>
 46 and
<a name="7" id="anc7"></a><span class="line-modified"> 47 [Jigsaw](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw)</span>
 48 also use this model. In contrast,
<a name="8" id="anc8"></a><span class="line-modified"> 49 [Code Tools](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools) uses an unrelated repository for each tool and</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 50 [Graal](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/graal)</span>
 51 uses only a single repository. Regardless of how a Project has chosen to store
 52 their code, each
<a name="9" id="anc9"></a><span class="line-modified"> 53 [Contributor](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#contributor)</span>
 54 clones the repository associated with the code they are modifying.
 55 
 56 &gt; ---
 57 &gt; Consult the Project&#39;s documentation or
<a name="10" id="anc10"></a><span class="line-modified"> 58 &gt; [mailing list](https://mail.openjdk.java.net) to</span>
 59 &gt; determine the appropriate repository, development conventions, and helpful
 60 &gt; tools.
 61 
 62 &gt; ---
 63 
 64 This is the typical development model:
 65 
 66 ::: {style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;}
 67 ![Diagram of server repos and user&#39;s clone](devModel.gif)
 68 :::
 69 
 70 A Contributor creates a _clone_ (a local copy called
 71 &quot;9dev&quot;) of a read/write repository (&quot;jdk9/dev&quot;) which resides on the OpenJDK
 72 Mercurial server. They work on their change in the clone and locally
 73 _commit_ a changeset. After the new changeset(s) are
 74 verified, they&#39;re either _pushed_ directly from the
 75 clone or _exported_ and delivered to a
<a name="11" id="anc11"></a><span class="line-modified"> 76 [Committer](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer)</span>
 77 who can perform the push into the server repository for all to see.
 78 
 79 &gt; ---
 80 &gt; The use of _gate repositories_ was eliminated when the
 81 &gt; Mercurial servers were upgraded in March 2014.
 82 
 83 &gt; ---
 84 
 85 The repositories use the following naming scheme:
 86 
 87 &gt; `&lt;project&gt;/&lt;component_path&gt;`
 88 
 89 where

 91 &gt; ------------------  ----  ----------------------------------------------------
<a name="12" id="anc12"></a><span class="line-modified"> 92 &gt; _project_            ::   the short name of an OpenJDK [Project](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#_6) such as &quot;jdk9&quot;, &quot;openjfx&quot;, or &quot;sumatra&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 93 &gt; _component_path_     ::   the path to a repository containing the code base as designated by the [Project Lead](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#project-lead).</span>
 94 &gt; ------------------  ----  ----------------------------------------------------
 95 
 96 ## Installing and Configuring Mercurial
 97 
 98 Mercurial is a free, cross-platform, distributed source management tool. Source
 99 bundles and binary packages for Mercurial are available at
<a name="13" id="anc13"></a><span class="line-modified">100 [https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi](https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial).</span>
101 The OpenJDK repositories recommend installation of Mercurial 2.6.3 (or later).
102 A Mercurial installation is sufficient to clone a repository. Contributors who
103 wish to submit changes will need some additional configuration as described
104 below.
105 
106 Some Projects may recommend additional tools or scripts that help with
107 repository manipulation and code development. For instance, in JDK 9, the
108 utility script `common/bin/hgforest.sh` may be
109 used to apply commands to all the repositories in the
110 [forest](glossary.html#forest). Popular extensions for OpenJDK developers include
<a name="14" id="anc14"></a><span class="line-modified">111 [jcheck](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/),</span>
<span class="line-modified">112 [trees](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/trees/), and</span>
<span class="line-modified">113 [Mercurial Queues](https://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/managing-change-with-mercurial-queues.html)</span>
114 (mq). Note that `trees` is enabled on the OpenJDK Mercurial server.
115 
116 Create and edit the `~/.hgrc` file to minimally contain the following entry:
117 
118 &gt;     [ui]
119 &gt;     username = &lt;openjdk_username&gt;
120 
121 _openjdk\_username_ is a plain lowercase, alphanumeric
122 token (not an e-mail address) with twelve characters or less. The first
123 character should be alphabetic. This username will be publicly visible in all
124 Mercurial changeset logs. It will be used to verify that the changeset author
125 is at least an
<a name="15" id="anc15"></a><span class="line-modified">126 [Author](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#author)</span>
127 for the Project and that the person pushing the changeset is at least a
<a name="16" id="anc16"></a><span class="line-modified">128 [Committer](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer).</span>
129 It is recommended that the _openjdk\_username_ be
130 somehow related to the Author&#39;s full name, such as the first character of the
131 Author&#39;s first name followed by the Author&#39;s last name. Refer to the
132 [Becoming an Author](../projects/index.html#project-author) section of the
133 [Project](../projects/index.html) page for
134 additional information.
135 
136 An alphabetical list of all of the assigned
137 _openjdk\_usernames_ may be found on the
<a name="17" id="anc17"></a><span class="line-modified">138 [OpenJDK people](https://db.openjdk.java.net/people) list. The</span>
139 [Census](../census) shows the structure of the OpenJDK Community.
140 
141 #### Verifying the Configuration
142 
143 After installing and configuring Mercurial, validate the configuration using
144 the following steps.
145 
146 #. Verify that Mercurial is version 2.6.3 (or newer).
147 
148    &gt;     $ hg version
149    &gt;     Mercurial Distributed SCM (version 2.9)
150    &gt;     (see http://mercurial.selenic.com for more information)

155 
156 #. Verify that the list of enabled extensions includes fetch and mq.
157 
158    &gt;     $ hg help
159    &gt; [full output](hgHelp.html)
160 
161 #. Verify that the `~/.hgrc` configuration looks correct. Minimally it should contain the following entries:
162 
163    &gt;     $ hg showconfig
164    &gt;     ui.username=iris
165 
166 At this point, it should be possible to start retrieving source from the
167 repositories.
168 
169 ## Cloning
170 
171 With Mercurial each developer works with a clone of the repository which is a
172 snapshot of the files at the time the clone was taken. To update the clone, see
173 [Producing a Changeset](producingChangeset.html).
174 
175 #### ... a Sandbox Repository {#cloneSandbox}
176 
177 In addition to the Project repositories, there are some test repositories that
178 may be used to run test commands against Mercurial without fear of causing
179 damage to development source. Use them freely but with discretion; content in
180 them may be deleted at any time.
181 
182 &gt;     $ mkdir sandbox; cd sandbox
183 &gt;     $ hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/sandbox/box
184 &gt;     destination directory: box
185 &gt;     requesting all changes
186 &gt;     adding changesets
187 &gt;     adding manifests
188 &gt;     adding file changes
189 &gt;     added 23 changesets with 24 changes to 5 files
190 &gt;     4 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
191 &gt;     $ du -s box
192 &gt;     46      box
193 
194 #### ... a Forest {#cloneForest}
195 
196 If a Project uses a forest, It is strongly recommended for developers to clone
197 an entire forest, rather than a single repository. This is the only means to
198 ensure consistency in builds. The following examples illustrate two
199 alternatives for cloning the entire _jdk9/dev_ forest
200 into the directory `9dev`.
201 
202 #. To clone the forest using the
<a name="18" id="anc18"></a><span class="line-modified">203 [trees](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/trees/)</span>
204 extension just use `tclone`:
205 
206    &gt;     $ hg tclone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev 9dev
207    &gt; [full output](tClone.html)
208 
209 #. To clone the forest using `get_source.sh`, first
210 clone the main tree:
211 
212    &gt;     $ hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev 9dev
213    &gt;     requesting all changes
214    &gt;     adding changesets
215    &gt;     adding manifests
216    &gt;     adding file changes
217    &gt;     added 997 changesets with 1477 changes to 138 files
218    &gt;     updating to branch default
219    &gt;     82 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
220 
221    Then clone the repositories in the forest:
222 
223    &gt;     $ cd 9dev
224    &gt;     $ sh ./get_source.sh
225    &gt; [full output](getSource.html)
226 
227 Regardless of how the forest was cloned, this is the resulting populated
228 forest.
229 
230 &gt;     $ du -s
231 &gt;     934532  .
232 &gt;     $ ls
233 &gt;     ASSEMBLY_EXCEPTION  hotspot    LICENSE   README-builds.html
234 &gt;     common              jaxp       make      test
235 &gt;     configure           jaxws      Makefile  THIRD_PARTY_README
236 &gt;     corba               jdk        nashorn
237 &gt;     get_source.sh       langtools  README
238 
239 #### ... a Single Repository {#cloneSingle}
240 
241 If the source for the Project is contained within a single repository or
242 reading a limited portion of the source is the only goal, it is possible to
243 clone a single repository (even if it&#39;s part of a forest). For instance, this
244 example shows how to clone the `langtools`
245 repository from _jdk9/dev_ into the default
246 destination directory.
247 
248 &gt;     $ hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev/langtools
249 &gt;     destination directory: langtools
250 &gt;     requesting all changes
251 &gt;     adding changesets
252 &gt;     adding manifests
253 &gt;     adding file changes
254 &gt;     added 2289 changesets with 21194 changes to 7004 files
255 &gt;     updating to branch default
256 &gt;     6212 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
257 &gt;     $ du -s langtools
258 &gt;     84396   langtools
