25 [**forest**]{#forest}
26 :   A collection of Mercurial repositories which can be managed as a set of nested
27     repositories. The name &quot;Forest&quot; originally came from the Mercurial &quot;Forest
28     Extension&quot; which can be used with some versions of Mercurial, but in general is
29     no longer recommended. The script
30     `common/bin/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply a
31     Mercurial `hg` command to all the repositories in
32     a forest.
33 
34 [**Group**]{#group}
35 :   A collection of [Participants](/bylaws#participant) who engage in
36     open conversation about a common interest. That interest may be in the
37     creation, enhancement, or maintenance of a specific body of code or it may lie
38     in other areas, e.g., quality, documentation, or evangelism. See the
39     [Group overview](../groups/).
40 
41 [**Mercurial**]{#mercurial}
42 :   A free, cross-platform, distributed source management tool. Source bundles and
43     binary packages for Mercurial are available at
<span class="line-modified">44     [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial).</span>
45     The main Mercurial documentation is available at
<span class="line-modified">46     [http://hgbook.red-bean.com](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/).</span>
47 
48 [**Project**]{#project}
49 :   A collaborative effort to produce a specific artifact, which may be a body of
50     code, or documentation, or some other material. See the
51     [Project overview](../projects/).
52 
53 [**repository**]{#repository}
54 :   A directory tree in the filesystem that Mercurial treats specially. This tree
55    contains the source files and their revision history.
56 
57 [**webrev**]{#webrev}
58 :   A tool and its output. In JDK release forests, the script,
<span class="line-modified">59     [`webrev.ksh`](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/webrev/raw-file/tip/webrev.ksh),</span>
60     examines a forest or repository to generate a set of web-based views of
61     differences.
