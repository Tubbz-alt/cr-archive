 ## Installing and Configuring Mercurial
 
 Mercurial is a free, cross-platform, distributed source management tool. Source
 bundles and binary packages for Mercurial are available at
-[http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial).
+[https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi](https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial).
 The OpenJDK repositories recommend installation of Mercurial 2.6.3 (or later).
 A Mercurial installation is sufficient to clone a repository. Contributors who
 wish to submit changes will need some additional configuration as described
 below.
 
 Some Projects may recommend additional tools or scripts that help with
 repository manipulation and code development. For instance, in JDK 9, the
 utility script `common/bin/hgforest.sh` may be
 used to apply commands to all the repositories in the
 [forest](glossary.html#forest). Popular extensions for OpenJDK developers include
-[jcheck](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/),
-[trees](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/trees/), and
