  7 This section describes the development process of identifying a bug or
  8 enhancement (formerly &quot;Request for Enhancement&quot; (RFE)) and providing a
  9 solution. The instructions assume that the
 10 [Contributor](/bylaws#contributor) already has a
 11 working build environment and has some familiarity with an existing OpenJDK
 12 [Project](bylaws#_6) and its repositories.
 13 
 14 Three classes of changes are treated in separate sections:
 15 
 16 * [Fixing a Bug](#fixing-a-bug) provides a step-by-step
 17 workflow for fixing a simple bug. Of particular note is the list of
 18 [noreg bug labels](#noreg) for changes which do not have regression tests.
 19 * [Adding an API](#adding-an-api) is TBD.
 20 * [Adding a Feature/JSR](#adding-a-featurejsr) is TBD.
 21 
 22 ## Fixing a Bug
 23 
 24 This is the list of steps which should be performed when fixing a small bug.
 25 Small bugs include typos in code or specification, algorithm improvements for
 26 correctness or performance, and code changes required to correctly implement
 27 the specification.
 28 
 29 &gt; ---
 30 &gt; Some steps refer to operations which can not be performed directly without the
 31 &gt; assistance of a [Project Committer](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer).
 32 &gt; For example, any changes to the
 33 &gt; [bug database](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net) fall into
 34 &gt; this category. Since these steps are required,
 35 &gt; [Contributors](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#contributor)
 36 &gt; are urged to work with their [Sponsors](/sponsor/)
 37 &gt; to complete these tasks.
 38 
 39 &gt; ---
 40 
 41 For the purposes of brevity this document will use the term &quot;bug&quot; to refer to
 42 both bugs and enhancements unless otherwise noted. Hence &quot;fix for a bug&quot; could
 43 also imply &quot;implementation for an enhancement&quot;.
 44 
 45 #. **Discuss the intended change**
 46 
 47    Send an e-mail to the appropriate development mailing list for the Project that
 48    maintains the code. The e-mail should have a subject line of the form:
 49 
 50    &gt;     6543210: My favorite bug
 51 
 52    where `6543210` is replaced with the actual bug id number or
 53    &quot;[NEW BUG]&quot; if the bug id is not known and `My favorite bug` is
 54    replaced with the bug&#39;s summary.  The message should describe the intended
 55    change, which components may be affected, and any other risks or
 56    concerns.
 57 
 58 #. **Does a bug id exist for the work?**
 59 
 60    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 61     Y   Continue
 62 
 63     N   Create a bug in an appropriate component/sub-component.
 64    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 65 
 66 #. **Set the bug status to &quot;Open&quot;**
 67 
 68    This communicates intent to fix the bug to other members of the Project. It
 69    also sets the expectation for downstream teams such as SQE and JCK that the bug
 70    will be fixed in an upcoming integration.
 71 
 72 #. **Does the fix for the bug require a specification change,
 73    directly affect an external interface, or otherwise have a compatibility
 74    impact?**
 75 
 76    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 77     Y   Submission of a CSR request is required. The CSR must be [approved](glossary.html#approved)
 78         before the bug fix is pushed to a feature release or update release
 79         repository. The work may begin concurrently with the CSR review, but may
 80         need to be modified in response to CSR feedback. A summary of the CSR process
 81         may be found in [Review Bodies](reviewBodies.html).
 82 
 83     N   Continue
 84    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 85 
 86 #. **Fix the bug**
 87 
 88    Assuming that the development team approves of the intended approach, begin
 89    working on the code using the latest source available from the appropriate
 90    OpenJDK Project [repository](https://hg.openjdk.java.net).
 91 
 92 #. [**Is it possible to write a test to detect the bug?**]{#noreg}
 93 
 94    +:-:+:---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 95    | Y | For bugs, provide a [jtreg](../jtreg/) regression test               |
 96    |   | as part of the changeset. For enhancements that directly affect      |
 97    |   | one or more exported interfaces, add an adequate set of jtreg unit   |
 98    |   | tests as part of the changeset. By convention all regression and     |
 99    |   | unit tests should contain a                                          |
100    |   | [\@bug tag](https://openjdk.java.net/jtreg/tag-spec.html#INFORMATIONAL_TAGS9) |
101    |   | referencing at least one bugid.                                      |
102    +---+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
103    |   | An entirely new test (or tests) may not be required. For             |
104    |   | example, if the bug is an existing regression test failure, then     |
105    |   | when fixing the bug you should just add the new bug ID to the list   |
106    |   | of space-delimited bugs in the                                       |
107    |   | [\@bug tag](https://openjdk.java.net/jtreg/tag-spec.html#INFORMATIONAL_TAGS) |
108    |   | of the failing regression test, even if the test did not need to     |
109    |   | be updated.                                                          |
110    +---+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
111    | N | An explanation for why a test is unnecessary or infeasible is        |
112    |   | required.  Such an explanation is recorded by adding a label, and    |
113    |   | possibly a comment, to the bug report.  The label has the prefix     |
114    |   | &quot;noreg&quot; for regression tests and &quot;nounit&quot; for unit tests.  The       |
115    |   | suffixes and their meanings are as follows:                          |

118    |   | :    Change can be verified by running an existing SQE test suite;   |
119    |   |      the bug should identify the suite and the specific test case(s).|
120    |   |                                                                      |

122    |   | :    Change can be verified by running the JCK; the bug should       |
123    |   |      identify the specific test case(s).                             |
124    |   |                                                                      |

126    |   | :    Change can be verified by running an existing external test     |
127    |   |      suite; the bug should identify the suite and the specific test  |
128    |   |      case(s).                                                        |
129    |   |                                                                      |

131    |   | :    Change only affects documentation.                              |
132    |   |                                                                      |

134    |   | :    Change only affects demo code.                                  |
135    |   |                                                                      |

137    |   | :    Change only affects build infrastructure (makefiles,            |
138    |   |      copyrights, scripts, etc.).                                     |
139    |   |                                                                      |
140    |   | [**-self**]{#noreg-self}                                             |
141    |   | :    Change is a fix to a regression or unit test itself.            |
142    |   |                                                                      |
143    |   | [**-perf**]{#noreg-perf}                                             |
144    |   | :    Change is for a performance bug for which writing a regression  |
145    |   |      test is infeasible; the bug should describe how to verify the   |
146    |   |      fix.                                                            |
147    |   |                                                                      |
148    |   | [**-hard**]{#noreg-hard}                                             |
149    |   | :    It is too hard to write a regression or unit test for this bug  |
150    |   |      (e.g., theoretical race condition, complex setup, reboot        |
151    |   |      required, editing of installed files required, specific         |
152    |   |      graphics card required); the bug should explain why.            |
153    |   |                                                                      |

155    |   | :    Testing requires a very long running time (e.g., more than a    |
156    |   |      few minutes).                                                   |
157    |   |                                                                      |

159    |   | :    Testing requires an unreasonable quantity of resources (e.g.,   |
160    |   |      tens of gigabytes of filesystem space).                         |
161    |   |                                                                      |
162    |   | [**-trivial**]{#noreg-trivial}                                       |
163    |   | :    Change is so trivial that nothing could possibly go wrong with  |
164    |   |      it.                                                             |
165    |   |                                                                      |
166    |   | [**-cleanup**]{#noreg-cleanup}                                       |
167    |   | :    Change is a cleanup or refactoring of existing code that is     |
168    |   |      covered by existing tests.                                      |
169    |   |                                                                      |
170    |   | [**-l10n**]{#noreg-l10n}                                             |
171    |   | :    Change only affects localized text.                             |
172    |   |                                                                      |
173    |   | [**-undo**]{#noreg-undo}                                             |
174    |   | :    Change is a reversion of a previous faulty change.              |
175    |   |                                                                      |

177    |   | :    Regression or unit test is unnecessary or infeasible for some   |
178    |   |      other reason; the bug report should explain why.                |
179    |   |                                                                      |
180    |   | Examples:  If a bug fix only corrects a change in the build system,  |
181    |   | then add the &quot;noreg-build&quot; label to the corresponding bug. If the    |
182    |   | change improves loop optimizations in HotSpot, then add              |
183    |   | &quot;nounit-perf&quot; to the corresponding bug.                              |

186 #. **Is modification of shared Java code needed?**
187 
188    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
189     Y   It is often sufficient to build and test on a single platform,
190         but sometimes it is not. Use discretion.
191 
192     N   Continue
193    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
194 
195 #. **Is modification of shared C code needed?**
196 
197    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
198     Y   Build and test on at least one instance of all three of the
199         supported operating systems (Solaris, Linux, and
200         Windows).
201 
202     N   Continue
203    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
204 
205 #. **Is modification of C or Java platform-specific code needed?**
206 
207    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
208     Y   Build and test on all relevant platforms.  Code under
209         `src/solaris` builds on Solaris, Linux, and MacOS X
210         despite its name.
211 
212     N   Continue
213    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
214 
215 #. **Run relevant regression and unit tests on all relevant platforms**
216 
217    These include tests for external interfaces as well as other kinds of tests,
218    e.g., HotSpot tests that use internal verification mechanisms. See
219    [Testing Changes](testingChanges.html) for more details.
220 
221 #. **Run relevant JCK tests on all relevant platforms**
222 
223    Running JCK tests is particularly important if the change may have unexpected
224    side-effects. See [JCK Acquisition](jckAcquisition.html) for more details.
225 
226 #. **Request a review of the changes by sending an e-mail to
227 the development alias**
228 
229    A patch can be submitted as described in [Contributing](../contribute/). Alternatively, a
230    [&quot;webrev&quot;](webrevHelp.html) may be generated and
231    uploaded to the [community code review](https://cr.openjdk.java.net/) server.
232    The complete webrev generation and upload procedure is described at
233    [https://cr.openjdk.java.net](https://cr.openjdk.java.net/).
234 
235    Changeset pushes before the
236    [Feature Complete](/projects/jdk8/milestones#Feature_Complete)
237    require at least one [Reviewer](/bylaws#reviewer); pushes after
238    the Feature Complete require at least two Reviewers. In either case, the
239    more the merrier. Some teams may require more Reviewers. Check with
240    members of the Project.
241 
242    Reviewers should examine not only the code being added or
243    changed but also the relevant unit or regression tests.
244 
245    A change may require multiple Reviewers because it affects
246    multiple areas.  Reviewers should be aware that they take full
247    responsibility for the appropriateness and correctness of any changes in
248    their area of expertise.  If something goes wrong (e.g., the build breaks)
249    and the change&amp;apos;s author is unavailable, they may be asked to deal with
250    the problem.  Potential Reviewers are encouraged to refuse to review code
251    for which they are not qualified.
252 
253 #. **Create a changeset**
254 
255    Follow the instructions in [Producing a Changeset](producingChangeset.html).
256 
257 #. **Update the bug content**
258 
259    Bug descriptions and comments should be written
260    in a professional manner.
261 
262 #. **Push the changeset into the Project&#39;s forest**
263 
264    Follow the instructions in [Producing a Changeset](producingChangeset.html).
265    If working with a Sponsor, send the changeset to the
266    development mailing list so that they can handle the final push.
267 
268    The push will trigger a update to the bug which will make the
269    following changes:
270     
271     * Set the bug&#39;s &quot;Status&quot; to &quot;Resolved&quot; and &quot;Resolution to &quot;Fixed&quot;.
272     * Set the bug&#39;s &quot;Fix Version/s&quot; to an appropriate release.
273     * Set the bug&#39;s &quot;Resolved in Build&quot; to &quot;team&quot;.
274     * Add a Comment containing a reference to the changeset.
275 
276 _Congratulations!_ Your changeset will now make its
277 way towards a promoted build. When the changeset becomes part of a promoted
278 build, the bug&#39;s &quot;Resolved in Build&quot; will have a value of \&quot;b\[1-9\]\[0-9\]&amp;ast;\&quot;
279 to indicate the build number.
280 
281 ## Adding an API
282 
283 TBD
