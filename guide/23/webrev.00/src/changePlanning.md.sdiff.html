 15 
 16 * [Fixing a Bug](#fixing-a-bug) provides a step-by-step
 17 workflow for fixing a simple bug. Of particular note is the list of
 18 [noreg bug labels](#noreg) for changes which do not have regression tests.

 22 ## Fixing a Bug
 23 
 24 This is the list of steps which should be performed when fixing a small bug.
 25 Small bugs include typos in code or specification, algorithm improvements for
 26 correctness or performance, and code changes required to correctly implement
 27 the specification.
 28 
 29 &gt; ---
 30 &gt; Some steps refer to operations which can not be performed directly without the
<span class="line-modified"> 31 &gt; assistance of a [Project Committer](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer).</span>
 32 &gt; For example, any changes to the
<span class="line-modified"> 33 &gt; [bug database](http://bugs.openjdk.java.net) fall into</span>
 34 &gt; this category. Since these steps are required,
<span class="line-modified"> 35 &gt; [Contributors](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#contributor)</span>
 36 &gt; are urged to work with their [Sponsors](/sponsor/)
 37 &gt; to complete these tasks.

 41 For the purposes of brevity this document will use the term &quot;bug&quot; to refer to
 42 both bugs and enhancements unless otherwise noted. Hence &quot;fix for a bug&quot; could
 43 also imply &quot;implementation for an enhancement&quot;.
 44 
 45 #. **Discuss the intended change**
 46 
 47    Send an e-mail to the appropriate development mailing list for the Project that
 48    maintains the code. The e-mail should have a subject line of the form:
 49 
 50    &gt;     6543210: My favorite bug
 51 
 52    where `6543210` is replaced with the actual bug id number or
 53    &quot;[NEW BUG]&quot; if the bug id is not known and `My favorite bug` is
 54    replaced with the bug&#39;s summary.  The message should describe the intended
 55    change, which components may be affected, and any other risks or

 72 #. **Does the fix for the bug require a specification change,
 73    directly affect an external interface, or otherwise have a compatibility
 74    impact?**
 75 
 76    ---  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 77     Y   Submission of a CSR request is required. The CSR must be [approved](glossary.html#approved)
 78         before the bug fix is pushed to a feature release or update release
 79         repository. The work may begin concurrently with the CSR review, but may
 80         need to be modified in response to CSR feedback. A summary of the CSR process
 81         may be found in [Review Bodies](reviewBodies.html).

 95    | Y | For bugs, provide a [jtreg](../jtreg/) regression test               |
 96    |   | as part of the changeset. For enhancements that directly affect      |
 97    |   | one or more exported interfaces, add an adequate set of jtreg unit   |
 98    |   | tests as part of the changeset. By convention all regression and     |
 99    |   | unit tests should contain a                                          |

102    +---+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
103    |   | An entirely new test (or tests) may not be required. For             |
104    |   | example, if the bug is an existing regression test failure, then     |
105    |   | when fixing the bug you should just add the new bug ID to the list   |

111    | N | An explanation for why a test is unnecessary or infeasible is        |
112    |   | required.  Such an explanation is recorded by adding a label, and    |
113    |   | possibly a comment, to the bug report.  The label has the prefix     |
114    |   | &quot;noreg&quot; for regression tests and &quot;nounit&quot; for unit tests.  The       |

217    These include tests for external interfaces as well as other kinds of tests,

239    more the merrier. Some teams may require more Reviewers. Check with
240    members of the Project.
241 
242    Reviewers should examine not only the code being added or
243    changed but also the relevant unit or regression tests.
244 
245    A change may require multiple Reviewers because it affects
246    multiple areas.  Reviewers should be aware that they take full
247    responsibility for the appropriateness and correctness of any changes in
248    their area of expertise.  If something goes wrong (e.g., the build breaks)
249    and the change&amp;apos;s author is unavailable, they may be asked to deal with
250    the problem.  Potential Reviewers are encouraged to refuse to review code
