 7 The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work.
 8 All participation in an OpenJDK project starts with joining the relevant mailing
 9 list. A subscriber to an OpenJDK mailing list is referred to as a Participant
10 in the [Bylaws](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws). As a general recommendation we suggest
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified">11 to subscribe to [announce](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/announce),</span>
<span class="line-modified">12 [discuss](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/discuss), and the `-dev` lists</span>
13 covering your explicit area of interest. All OpenJDK mailing lists are found here:
14 
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">15 &gt; [`mail.openjdk.java.net`](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo)</span>
16 
17 The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it&#39;s important to
18 keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global.
19 Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists.
20 Even though English is the required language for all lists, many Participants
21 speak other languages as their native language. A high tolerance for non-perfect
22 English is expected from anyone joining these lists.
23 
24 You must be in the list to send to the list. Some lists are moderated to keep the
25 content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older
26 conversations on the list.
27 
28 There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what
29 the list is intended for, `&lt;name&gt;-&lt;suffix&gt;`. The name often refers to the project
30 that owns the list or a specific area of interest that the list focuses on.
31 The suffix is explained below. Not all projects or areas have all types of
32 lists described here.
33 
34 &gt; `-dev`
35 &gt; :    Technical discussions around the implementation of the project artifacts. This
36        is also where code reviews happen.
37 
38 &gt; `-use`
39 &gt; :    Technical discussions around the usage of the project artifacts.
40 
41 &gt; `-discuss`
42 &gt; :    General discussions around the project. The special case `discuss(at)openjdk.java.net`
43        is used for general discussions around the OpenJDK project. Discussions around new
44        project proposals usually happens here.
45 
46 &gt;  `-changes`
47 &gt; :    Changeset notifications from the source code repositories maintained by the project.
48 
49 &gt; `-announce`
50 &gt; :    General project announcements. These lists are tightly moderated and are
51        expected to be low traffic. The special case `announce(at)openjdk.java.net`
52        is used for announcements for the OpenJDK project.
53 
54 &gt; `-experts`
55 &gt; :    Expert group discussions. The list is restricted; only members of the expert
56        group can subscribe.
57 
58 &gt; `-observers`
59 &gt; :    Open for anyone to subscribe to see what the experts are discussing and potentially
60        to have some dialog with other non-experts. There is no guarantee that an expert is
61        subscribed to the `-observers` list or will see any responses on that list.
62 
63 &gt; `-comments`
64 &gt; :    Used by observers to directly provide feedback/comments to the experts (typically
65        a lead will process the comments list and forward things on to the experts list).
