  #### Pushing a Changeset
  
<span class="line-modified">! [Committers](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer)</span>
  can use the _**hg**_ `push` command to propagate changesets into the repositories.
  
  Most developers will only find a need to create changesets in one or two
  repositories. However, it is important that before any changesets are pushed,
  the corresponding forest pull and merge with the destination forest be
  performed; otherwise there is a risk of breaking the build.
  
  &gt;     $ hg push
  
  After the push has been accepted, an automatic e-mail notification will be sent
<span class="line-modified">! to the [mailing list](http://mail.openjdk.java.net) associated with the</span>
  repository. In most cases notifications
  are sent to the Project&#39;s _-dev_ mailing list. Some
  Projects with high traffic _-dev_ mailing lists use a
  dedicated _-changes_ list for notifications.

<span class="line-modified">! &gt; All of a Project&#39;s [Committers](http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer)</span>
  &gt; can push to all of the the Project&#39;s repositories.
  &gt;
  &gt; Some Projects may chose to restrict the set of Committers with push to key
  &gt; repositories. For instance, JDK Release Projects restrict push access to MASTER
  &gt; repositories to Committers who are either integrators or members of the Release
