 35 ## Terminology and Naming Scheme
 36 
 37 The OpenJDK code base for all
 38 [Projects](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#_6) is
 39 stored in Mercurial repositories which contain the source files and their
 40 change history. Some Projects may choose to organize their code into multiple,
 41 possibly related, Mercurial repositories. For instance,
 42 [JDK 9](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9)
 43 uses a forest of multiple related repositories which contain components of the
 44 entire JDK. Projects which are based on the JDK, such as
 45 [IcedTea](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/icedtea)
 46 and
 47 [Jigsaw](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw)
 48 also use this model. In contrast,
 49 [Code Tools](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools) uses an unrelated repository for each tool and
 50 [Graal](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/graal)
 51 uses only a single repository. Regardless of how a Project has chosen to store
 52 their code, each

 96 ## Installing and Configuring Mercurial
 97 
 98 Mercurial is a free, cross-platform, distributed source management tool. Source
 99 bundles and binary packages for Mercurial are available at
100 [https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi](https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial).
101 The OpenJDK repositories recommend installation of Mercurial 2.6.3 (or later).
102 A Mercurial installation is sufficient to clone a repository. Contributors who
103 wish to submit changes will need some additional configuration as described
104 below.
105 
106 Some Projects may recommend additional tools or scripts that help with
107 repository manipulation and code development. For instance, in JDK 9, the
108 utility script `common/bin/hgforest.sh` may be
109 used to apply commands to all the repositories in the
110 [forest](glossary.html#forest). Popular extensions for OpenJDK developers include
111 [jcheck](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/),
112 [trees](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/trees/), and
<span class="line-modified">113 [Mercurial Queues](https://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/managing-change-with-mercurial-queues.html)</span>
114 (mq). Note that `trees` is enabled on the OpenJDK Mercurial server.
115 
116 Create and edit the `~/.hgrc` file to minimally contain the following entry:
117 
118 &gt;     [ui]
119 &gt;     username = &lt;openjdk_username&gt;
120 
121 _openjdk\_username_ is a plain lowercase, alphanumeric
122 token (not an e-mail address) with twelve characters or less. The first
123 character should be alphabetic. This username will be publicly visible in all
124 Mercurial changeset logs. It will be used to verify that the changeset author
125 is at least an
126 [Author](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#author)
127 for the Project and that the person pushing the changeset is at least a
128 [Committer](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer).
129 It is recommended that the _openjdk\_username_ be
130 somehow related to the Author&#39;s full name, such as the first character of the
131 Author&#39;s first name followed by the Author&#39;s last name. Refer to the
132 [Becoming an Author](../projects/index.html#project-author) section of the
