 13 required format of a changeset comment and describes how to commit files to a
 14 changeset.
 15 * [Merging](#merging) describes how to pull changes
 16 from a parent forest or clone and incorporate the changes into the current
 17 working set of files.
 18 * [Pushing](#pushing) covers configuring ssh, setting
 19 the `default-push` path, and pushing changesets.

 21 ## Setting a JDK User Name
 22 
 23 Ensure that _ui.username_ has a value in the
 24 `~/.hgrc` file as described in
 25 [Verifying the Configuration](repositories.html#verify).
 26 
 27 ## Creating
 28 
 29 The timing for creating a changeset is important. Creating the changeset long
 30 before it gets pushed into the parent repository may require complex merges. If
 31 a changeset is created before sufficient review or testing, a rollback may be
 32 required and a new changeset may be required to correct previous mistakes. The
<span class="line-modified"> 33 [mq extension](https://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch12.html#x16-26500012) is</span>
 34 recommended for managing changes before they become
 35 committed to a changeset.
 36 
 37 In the examples below, the script
 38 `common/bin/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply the
 39 Mercurial command to all the repositories in the forest. So when you see
 40 _**`hg`**_, if you are dealing with one repository, just use
 41 &quot;`hg`&quot;, if it&#39;s a forest, use &quot;`sh common/bin/hgforest.sh`&quot;.
 42 
 43 
 44 Each repository in the forest is managed independently. After editing files in
 45 the individual cloned repositories of the forest, the `hg
 46 status` command may be used to see the changes in a single
 47 repository.
 48 
 49 &gt;     $ hg root

133 ## Merging
134 
135 It is often necessary to merge local changes with those made in the parent
136 repositories. The first step in a merge process is to retrieve (or pull) the
137 collection of changesets which have been pushed since the last merge or initial
138 clone. If there if there are merge conflicts, then they must be resolved.
<span class="line-modified">139 [Chapter 3](https://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch3.html#x7-530003) of</span>
140 the Mercurial book contains detailed information on the
141 merging process.
142 
143 There are two basic ways to update the working set files in the repositories:
144 
145 Option 1: _**`hg`**_ `pull`
146 
147 &gt; One way to merge the parent repository with the working set of files is to use
148 &gt; _**`hg`**_ `pull` all by itself. This option allows merging off-line or at a
149 &gt; later time.
150 &gt;
151 &gt;&gt;     $ hg pull
152 &gt;&gt;     [.]
153 &gt;&gt;     pulling from http://hg.openjdk.java.net/sandbox/box
154 &gt;&gt;     searching for changes
155 &gt;&gt;     no changes found
156 &gt;
157 &gt; In Mercurial, pulling changesets will not update or merge into the working set
158 &gt; of files. To update the clone, run _**`hg`**_ `update`. If the update
159 &gt; reports conflicts, run _**`hg`**_ `merge` to resolve them.
