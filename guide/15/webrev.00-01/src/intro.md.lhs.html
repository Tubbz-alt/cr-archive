 7 Welcome to the OpenJDK Developers&#39; Guide!
 8 
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified"> 9 The OpejJDK project governs the Java programming language and the Java runtime.</span>
<span class="line-modified">10 The project was created when the JDK was first released under the GPLv2 license in May</span>

11 2007 and since then a community has grown around it to help develop and maintain Java.
12 
13 In order to work together efficiently clear directions are sometimes needed to
14 avoid misconceptions and to align developers&#39; views of terminology and process.
15 The OpenJDK community is a fairly pragmatic place. &quot;Do what&#39;s right&quot; is most
16 often the right course of action. Still, if people do things in the same right way
17 everyone&#39;s work becomes more transparent and easier for others to follow. For
18 this reason most parts of the development process have standard flows that are the
19 recommended ways to do things.
20 
21 The goal of this guide is to answer questions that the developers of the JDK might
22 have around development process, tooling, standards, etc. The formal rules and
23 processes are described in other documents, like [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1)
24 for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal &amp; Roadmap Process, or [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3)
25 for the JDK Release Process. This guide is meant to be a complement with tutorials
26 and examples for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest
27 of the OpenJDK community.
28 
29 There are many common use cases that aren&#39;t detailed in the formal process. This
30 guide contains the defacto standard for how to work in such cases.
