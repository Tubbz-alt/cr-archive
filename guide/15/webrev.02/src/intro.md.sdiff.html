<span class="line-modified"> 7 Welcome to the OpenJDK Developers&#39; Guide!</span>




 8 
<span class="line-modified"> 9 OpenJDK is the place to collaborate on an open-source implementation</span>
<span class="line-added">10 of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects.</span>
<span class="line-added">11 OpenJDK was created when the JDK was first released under the GPLv2 license in May</span>
<span class="line-added">12 2007 and since then a community has grown around it to help develop and maintain Java.</span>
<span class="line-added">13 </span>
<span class="line-added">14 In order to work together efficiently clear directions are sometimes needed to</span>
<span class="line-added">15 avoid misconceptions and to align developers&#39; views of terminology and process.</span>
<span class="line-added">16 The OpenJDK community is a fairly pragmatic place. &quot;Do what&#39;s right&quot; is most</span>
<span class="line-added">17 often the right course of action. Still, if people do things in the same right way</span>
<span class="line-added">18 everyone&#39;s work becomes more transparent and easier for others to follow. For</span>
<span class="line-added">19 this reason most parts of the development process have standard flows that are the</span>
<span class="line-added">20 recommended ways to do things.</span>
<span class="line-added">21 </span>
<span class="line-added">22 The goal of this guide is to answer questions that the developers of the JDK might</span>
<span class="line-added">23 have around development process, tooling, standards, etc. The formal rules and</span>
<span class="line-added">24 processes are described in other documents, like [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1)</span>
<span class="line-added">25 for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal &amp; Roadmap Process, or [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3)</span>
<span class="line-added">26 for the JDK Release Process. This guide is meant to be a complement with tutorials</span>
<span class="line-added">27 and examples for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest</span>
<span class="line-added">28 of the OpenJDK community.</span>
<span class="line-added">29 </span>
<span class="line-added">30 There are many common use cases that aren&#39;t detailed in the formal process. This</span>
<span class="line-added">31 guide contains the defacto standard for how to work in such cases.</span>
