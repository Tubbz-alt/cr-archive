 The FAQ is transient. It should only contain things that have not been
 integrated into the main document. If questions remain in the FAQ over more
 than a few revisions, it will be to provide a pointer to the section in the
 main document which contains the answer.

-When the JDK was released under the GPLv2 license in May 2007, the need for a
-detailed document for contributors was anticipated. Translating rather
-sophisticated institutional knowledge into a format suitable for non-Oracle
-employees is always a challenge. This document attempts to address the needs of
-developers who wish to participate in the future of the JDK.
+Welcome to the OpenJDK Developers' Guide!
 
-Comments may be sent to [guide-dev (at) openjdk.java.net](mailto:guide-dev-at-openjdk.java.net).
+OpenJDK is the place to collaborate on an open-source implementation
+of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects.
+OpenJDK was created when the JDK was first released under the GPLv2 license in May
+2007 and since then a community has grown around it to help develop and maintain Java.
+
+In order to work together efficiently clear directions are sometimes needed to
+avoid misconceptions and to align developers' views of terminology and process.
+The OpenJDK community is a fairly pragmatic place. "Do what's right" is most
+often the right course of action. Still, if people do things in the same right way
+everyone's work becomes more transparent and easier for others to follow. For
+this reason most parts of the development process have standard flows that are the
+recommended ways to do things.
+
+The goal of this guide is to answer questions that the developers of the JDK might
+have around development process, tooling, standards, etc. The formal rules and
+processes are described in other documents, like [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1)
+for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal & Roadmap Process, or [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3)
+for the JDK Release Process. This guide is meant to be a complement with tutorials
+and examples for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest
+of the OpenJDK community.
+
+There are many common use cases that aren't detailed in the formal process. This
+guide contains the defacto standard for how to work in such cases.
