 <p>While collecting code coverage with JCov, it is also possible to find coverage for only recently changed code. JCOV_DIFF_CHANGESET specifies a source revision. A textual report will be generated showing coverage of the diff between the specified revision and the repository tip.</p>
 <p>The report is stored in <code>build/$BUILD/test-results/jcov-output/diff_coverage_report</code> file.</p>
