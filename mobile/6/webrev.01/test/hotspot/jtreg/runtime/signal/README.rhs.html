23 Briefly, the tests cover the following scenarios:
24 1. prepre
25    set signal handlers -&gt; create JVM -&gt; send signals -&gt; destroy JVM -&gt; check signal handlers were called
26 
27 2. prepost
28    set signal handlers -&gt; create JVM -&gt; destroy JVM -&gt; send signals  -&gt; check signal handlers were called
29 
30 3. postpre
31    create JVM -&gt;set signal handlers -&gt; send signals -&gt; destroy JVM -&gt; check signal handlers were called
32 
33 4. postpost
34    create JVM -&gt; set signal handlers -&gt; destroy JVM -&gt; send signals  -&gt; check signal handlers were called
35 
36 There is one more scenario called &#39;nojvm&#39;.
37 In this case no jvm is created, so pure signal testing is done.
38 
39 Signal handlers don&#39;t do anything, so the only fact that signal handler was called is checked.
40 Also 2 different ways of setting signal handlers are tested: sigaction, sigset.
41 
42 For &#39;postpre&#39; and &#39;postpro&#39; libjsig.so is used to chain signal handlers behind VM installed ones.
43 
44 =&gt; Current tests cover the following cases (don&#39;t count &#39;nojvm&#39; scenario):
45 1. Support for pre-installed signal handlers when the HotSpot VM is created.
46 2. Support for signal handler installation after the HotSpot VM is created inside JNI code
47 
48 
49 Notes:
50 
51 SIGQUIT, SIGTERM, SIGINT, and SIGHUP signals cannot be chained.
52 If the application needs to handle these signals, the -Xrs option needs
53 to be specified. So, test these signals only with -Xrs flag.
54 
55 On Linux and Mac OS X, SIGUSR2 is used to implement suspend and resume. So,
56 don&#39;t test SIGUSR2 on Linux and Mac OS X.
