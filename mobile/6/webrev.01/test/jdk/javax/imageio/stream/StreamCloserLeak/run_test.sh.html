 29 #   @summary    Test simulates the case of multiple applets executed in
 30 #               the same VM and verifies that ImageIO shutdown hook
 31 #               StreamCloser does not cause a leak of classloaders.

 38 # There are several resources which need to be present before many
 39 #  shell scripts can run.  Following are examples of how to check for
 40 #  many common ones.
 41 #
 42 # Note that the shell used is the Korn Shell, KSH
 43 #
 44 # Also note, it is recommended that make files NOT be used.  Rather,
 45 #  put the individual commands directly into this file.  That way,
 46 #  it is possible to use command line arguments and other shell tech-
 47 #  niques to find the compiler, etc on different systems.  For example,
 48 #  a different path could be used depending on whether this were a
 49 #  Solaris or Win32 machine, which is more difficult (if even possible)
 50 #  in a make file.
