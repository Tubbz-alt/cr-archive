 36 # Note!!!! JavaCodeForYourTest_CHANGE_THIS.java must be changed or deleted.  
 37 # If there is any java code which will be executed during the test, it must 
 38 # be compiled by the line above.  If multiple .java files, separate the 
 39 # files by spaces on that line.  See testing page of AWT home page for
 40 # pointers to the testharness spec. and FAQ.
 41 # Note!!!! Change AppletDeadlock.sh to the name of your test!!!!

 43 # There are several resources which need to be present before many 
 44 #  shell scripts can run.  Following are examples of how to check for
 45 #  many common ones.
 46 # 
 47 # Note that the shell used is the Korn Shell, KSH
 48 #
 49 # Also note, it is recommended that make files NOT be used.  Rather,
 50 #  put the individual commands directly into this file.  That way,
 51 #  it is possible to use command line arguments and other shell tech-
 52 #  niques to find the compiler, etc on different systems.  For example,
 53 #  a different path could be used depending on whether this were a
 54 #  Solaris or Win32 machine, which is more difficult (if even possible)
 55 #  in a make file.
