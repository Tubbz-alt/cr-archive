  3 ### Mozilla ECC Notice
  4 
  5 You are receiving a 
  6 [copy](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk/file/tip/src/jdk.crypto.ec/share/native/libsunec/impl)
  7 of the Elliptic Curve Cryptography library in source form or object code.
  8 
  9 ```
 10 The terms of the Oracle license do NOT apply to the Elliptic Curve Cryptography
 11 library; it is licensed under the following license, separately from the Oracle 
 12 programs you received.  If you do not wish to install the Elliptic Curve 
 13 Cryptography library, you may delete the Elliptic Curve Cryptography library by 
 14 removing:
 15 
 16       Solaris:  $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/libsunec.so
 17       Linux:    $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/libsunec.so
 18       macOS:    $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/libsunec.dylib
 19       Windows:  $(JAVA_HOME)\bin\sunec.dll
 20 
 21 ```
 22 
 23 #### Mozilla ECC Library Removal Impact
 24 ```
 25 The Java Cryptographic Service SunEC Provider uses the Mozilla ECC library.  If 
 26 this native library is removed, the following algorithms will no longer be 
 27 available from the SunEC provider using the JCA/JCE APIs:
 28 
 29       KeyPairGenerator:  EC
 30       KeyAgreement:      ECDH
 31       Signature:         names that include *withECDSA* 
 32 
 33 ```
 34 
 35 #### Written Offer for Source Code
 36 
 37 ```
 38 For third party technology that you receive from Oracle in binary form which 
 39 is licensed under an open source license that gives you the right to receive 
 40 the source code for that binary, you can also receive a copy of the source 
 41 code on physical media by submitting a written request to:
 42 
 43         Oracle America, Inc. 
 44         Attn: Associate General Counsel, 
 45         Development and Engineering Legal 
 46         500 Oracle Parkway, 10th Floor 
 47         Redwood Shores, CA 94065
 48 
 49 Your request should include:
 50 ```
 51 
 52 * The name of the component or binary file(s) for which you are requesting 
 53   the source code
 54 * The name and version number of the Oracle product containing the binary
 55 * The date you received the Oracle product
 56 * Your name
 57 * Your company name (if applicable)
 58 * Your return mailing address and email and 
 59 * A telephone number in the event we need to reach you.
 60 
 61 ```
 62 We may charge you a fee to cover the cost of physical media and processing.
 63 Your request must be sent (i) within three (3) years of the date you received
 64 the Oracle product that included the component or binary file(s) that are the
 65 subject of your request, or (ii) in the case of code licensed under the GPL
 66 v3, for as long as Oracle offers spare parts or customer support for that
 67 product model.

 96                        Version 2.1, February 1999
 97 
 98  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

100  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
101  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
102 
103 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
104  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
105  the version number 2.1.]
106 
107                             Preamble
108 
109   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
110 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
111 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
112 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
113 
114   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
115 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
116 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
117 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
118 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
119 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
120 
121   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
122 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
123 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
124 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
125 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
126 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
127 these things.
128 
129   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
130 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
131 rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
132 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
133 
134   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
135 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
136 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
137 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
138 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
139 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
140 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
141 
142   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
143 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
144 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
145 
146   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
147 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
148 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
149 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
150 author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
151 introduced by others.
152 
153   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
154 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
155 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
156 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
157 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
158 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
159 
160   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
161 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
162 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
163 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
164 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
165 libraries into non-free programs.
166 
167   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
168 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
169 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
170 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
171 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
172 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
173 the library.
174 
175   We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
176 does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General
177 Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
178 of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
179 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
180 libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
181 special circumstances.
182 
183   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
184 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
185 a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
186 allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
187 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
188 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
189 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
190 
191   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
192 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
193 free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
194 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
195 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
196 system.
197 
198   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
199 users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
200 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
201 that program using a modified version of the Library.
202 
203   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
204 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
205 &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
206 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
207 be combined with the library in order to run.
208 
209                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
210    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
211 
212   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
213 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
214 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
215 this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
216 Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
217 
218   A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
219 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
220 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
221 
222   The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
223 which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
224 Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
225 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
226 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
227 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
228 included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
229 
230   &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
231 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
232 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
233 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
234 and installation of the library.
235 
236   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
237 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
238 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
239 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
240 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
241 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
242 and what the program that uses the Library does.
243 
244   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s
245 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
246 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
247 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
248 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
249 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
250 Library.
251 
252   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
253 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
254 fee.
255 
256   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
257 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
258 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
259 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
260 
261     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
262 
263     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
264     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
265 
266     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
267     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
268 
269     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
270     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
271     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
272     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
273     in the event an application does not supply such function or
274     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
275     its purpose remains meaningful.
276 
277     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
278     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
279     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
280     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
281     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
282     root function must still compute square roots.)
283 
284 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
285 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
286 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
287 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
288 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
289 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
290 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
291 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
292 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
293 it.
294 
295 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
296 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
297 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
298 collective works based on the Library.
299 
300 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
301 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
302 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
303 the scope of this License.
304 
305   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
306 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
307 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
308 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
309 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
310 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
311 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
312 these notices.
313 
314   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
315 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
316 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
317 
318   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
319 the Library into a program that is not a library.
320 
321   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
322 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
323 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
324 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
325 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
326 medium customarily used for software interchange.
327 
328   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
329 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
330 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
331 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
332 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
333 
334   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
335 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
336 linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
337 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
338 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
339 
340   However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
341 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
342 contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
343 library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
344 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
345 
346   When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
347 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
348 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
349 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
350 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
351 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
352 
353   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
354 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
355 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
356 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
357 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
358 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
359 
360   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
361 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
362 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
363 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
364 
365   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
366 link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
367 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
368 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
369 modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse
370 engineering for debugging such modifications.
371 
372   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
373 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
374 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
375 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
376 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
377 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
378 of these things:
379 
380     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
381     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
382     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
383     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
384     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
385     uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
386     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
387     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
388     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
389     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
390     to use the modified definitions.)
391 
392     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
393     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
394     copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,
395     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
396     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
397     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
398     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
399 
400     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
401     least three years, to give the same user the materials
402     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
403     than the cost of performing this distribution.
404 
405     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
406     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
407     specified materials from the same place.
408 
409     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
410     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
411 
412   For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
413 Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
414 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
415 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
416 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
417 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
418 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
419 the executable.
420 
421   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
422 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
423 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
424 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
425 distribute.
426 
427   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
428 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
429 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
430 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
431 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
432 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
433 
434     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
435     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
436     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
437     Sections above.
438 
439     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
440     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
441     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
442 
443   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
444 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
445 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
446 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
447 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
448 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
449 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
450 
451   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
452 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
453 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
454 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
455 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
456 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
457 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
458 the Library or works based on it.
459 
460   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
461 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
462 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
463 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
464 restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
465 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
466 this License.
467 
468   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
469 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
470 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
471 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
472 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
473 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
474 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
475 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
476 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
477 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
478 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
479 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
480 
481 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
482 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
483 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
484 
485 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
486 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
487 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
488 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
489 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
490 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
491 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
492 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
493 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
494 impose that choice.
495 
496 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
497 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
498 
499   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
500 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
501 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
502 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
503 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
504 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
505 written in the body of this License.
506 
507   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
508 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
509 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
510 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
511 
512 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
513 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
514 &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
515 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
516 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
517 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
518 the Free Software Foundation.
519 
520   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
521 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
522 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
523 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
524 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
525 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
526 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
527 and reuse of software generally.
528 
529                             NO WARRANTY
530 
531   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
532 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
533 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
534 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
535 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
536 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
537 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
538 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
539 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
540 
541   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
542 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
543 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
544 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
545 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
546 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
547 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
548 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
549 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
550 DAMAGES.
551 
552                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
553 
554            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
555 
556   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
557 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
558 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
559 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
560 ordinary General Public License).
561 
562   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
563 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
564 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
565 &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
566 
567     &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
568     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
569 
570     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
571     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
572     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
573     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
574 
575     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
576     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
577     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
578     Lesser General Public License for more details.
579 
580     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
581     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
582     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, 
583     Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
584 
585 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
586 
587 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
588 school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if
589 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
590 
591   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
592   library `Frob&#39; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
593 
594   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
595   Ty Coon, President of Vice
596 
597 That&#39;s all there is to it!
