  3 ### Mozilla ECC Notice
  4 
  5 You are receiving a 
  6 [copy](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk/file/tip/src/jdk.crypto.ec/share/native/libsunec/impl)
  7 of the Elliptic Curve Cryptography library in source form or object code.
  8 
  9 ```
 10 The terms of the Oracle license do NOT apply to the Elliptic Curve Cryptography
 11 library; it is licensed under the following license, separately from the Oracle 
 12 programs you received.  If you do not wish to install the Elliptic Curve 
 13 Cryptography library, you may delete the Elliptic Curve Cryptography library by 
 14 removing:
 15 
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a>
 16       Linux:    $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/libsunec.so
 17       macOS:    $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/libsunec.dylib
 18       Windows:  $(JAVA_HOME)\bin\sunec.dll
 19 
 20 ```
 21 
 22 #### Mozilla ECC Library Removal Impact
 23 ```
 24 The Java Cryptographic Service SunEC Provider uses the Mozilla ECC library.  If 
 25 this native library is removed, the following algorithms will no longer be 
 26 available from the SunEC provider using the JCA/JCE APIs:
 27 
 28       KeyPairGenerator:  EC
 29       KeyAgreement:      ECDH
 30       Signature:         names that include *withECDSA* 
 31 
 32 ```
 33 
 34 #### Written Offer for Source Code
 35 
 36 ```
 37 For third party technology that you receive from Oracle in binary form which 
 38 is licensed under an open source license that gives you the right to receive 
 39 the source code for that binary, you can also receive a copy of the source 
 40 code on physical media by submitting a written request to:
 41 
 42         Oracle America, Inc. 
 43         Attn: Associate General Counsel, 
 44         Development and Engineering Legal 
 45         500 Oracle Parkway, 10th Floor 
 46         Redwood Shores, CA 94065
 47 
 48 Your request should include:
 49 ```
 50 
 51 * The name of the component or binary file(s) for which you are requesting 
 52   the source code
 53 * The name and version number of the Oracle product containing the binary
 54 * The date you received the Oracle product
 55 * Your name
 56 * Your company name (if applicable)
 57 * Your return mailing address and email and 
 58 * A telephone number in the event we need to reach you.
 59 
 60 ```
 61 We may charge you a fee to cover the cost of physical media and processing.
 62 Your request must be sent (i) within three (3) years of the date you received
 63 the Oracle product that included the component or binary file(s) that are the
 64 subject of your request, or (ii) in the case of code licensed under the GPL
 65 v3, for as long as Oracle offers spare parts or customer support for that
 66 product model.

 94                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 95                        Version 2.1, February 1999
 96 
 97  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 98  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 99  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
100  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
101 
102 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
103  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
104  the version number 2.1.]
105 
106                             Preamble
107 
108   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
109 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
110 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
111 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
112 
113   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
114 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
115 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
116 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
117 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
118 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
119 
120   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
121 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
122 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
123 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
124 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
125 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
126 these things.
127 
128   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
129 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
130 rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
131 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
132 
133   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
134 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
135 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
136 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
137 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
138 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
139 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
140 
141   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
142 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
143 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
144 
145   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
146 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
147 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
148 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
149 author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
150 introduced by others.
151 
152   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
153 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
154 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
155 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
156 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
157 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
158 
159   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
160 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
161 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
162 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
163 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
164 libraries into non-free programs.
165 
166   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
167 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
168 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
169 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
170 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
171 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
172 the library.
173 
174   We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
175 does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General
176 Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
177 of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
178 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
179 libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
180 special circumstances.
181 
182   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
183 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
184 a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
185 allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
186 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
187 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
188 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
189 
190   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
191 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
192 free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
193 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
194 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
195 system.
196 
197   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
198 users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
199 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
200 that program using a modified version of the Library.
201 
202   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
203 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
204 &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
205 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
206 be combined with the library in order to run.
207 
208                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
209    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
210 
211   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
212 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
213 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
214 this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
215 Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
216 
217   A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
218 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
219 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
220 
221   The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
222 which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
223 Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
224 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
225 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
226 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
227 included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
228 
229   &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
230 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
231 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
232 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
233 and installation of the library.
234 
235   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
236 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
237 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
238 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
239 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
240 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
241 and what the program that uses the Library does.
242 
243   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s
244 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
245 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
246 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
247 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
248 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
249 Library.
250 
251   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
252 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
253 fee.
254 
255   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
256 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
257 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
258 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
259 
260     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
261 
262     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
263     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
264 
265     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
266     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
267 
268     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
269     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
270     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
271     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
272     in the event an application does not supply such function or
273     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
274     its purpose remains meaningful.
275 
276     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
277     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
278     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
279     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
280     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
281     root function must still compute square roots.)
282 
283 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
284 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
285 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
286 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
287 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
288 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
289 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
290 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
291 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
292 it.
293 
294 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
295 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
296 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
297 collective works based on the Library.
298 
299 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
300 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
301 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
302 the scope of this License.
303 
304   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
305 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
306 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
307 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
308 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
309 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
310 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
311 these notices.
312 
313   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
314 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
315 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
316 
317   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
318 the Library into a program that is not a library.
319 
320   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
321 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
322 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
323 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
324 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
325 medium customarily used for software interchange.
326 
327   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
328 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
329 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
330 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
331 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
332 
333   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
334 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
335 linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
336 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
337 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
338 
339   However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
340 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
341 contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
342 library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
343 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
344 
345   When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
346 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
347 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
348 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
349 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
350 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
351 
352   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
353 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
354 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
355 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
356 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
357 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
358 
359   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
360 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
361 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
362 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
363 
364   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
365 link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
366 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
367 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
368 modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse
369 engineering for debugging such modifications.
370 
371   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
372 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
373 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
374 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
375 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
376 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
377 of these things:
378 
379     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
380     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
381     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
382     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
383     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
384     uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
385     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
386     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
387     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
388     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
389     to use the modified definitions.)
390 
391     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
392     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
393     copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,
394     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
395     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
396     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
397     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
398 
399     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
400     least three years, to give the same user the materials
401     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
402     than the cost of performing this distribution.
403 
404     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
405     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
406     specified materials from the same place.
407 
408     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
409     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
410 
411   For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
412 Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
413 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
414 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
415 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
416 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
417 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
418 the executable.
419 
420   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
421 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
422 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
423 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
424 distribute.
425 
426   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
427 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
428 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
429 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
430 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
431 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
432 
433     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
434     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
435     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
436     Sections above.
437 
438     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
439     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
440     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
441 
442   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
443 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
444 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
445 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
446 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
447 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
448 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
449 
450   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
451 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
452 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
453 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
454 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
455 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
456 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
457 the Library or works based on it.
458 
459   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
460 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
461 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
462 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
463 restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
464 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
465 this License.
466 
467   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
468 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
469 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
470 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
471 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
472 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
473 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
474 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
475 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
476 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
477 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
478 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
479 
480 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
481 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
482 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
483 
484 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
485 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
486 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
487 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
488 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
489 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
490 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
491 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
492 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
493 impose that choice.
494 
495 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
496 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
497 
498   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
499 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
500 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
501 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
502 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
503 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
504 written in the body of this License.
505 
506   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
507 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
508 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
509 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
510 
511 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
512 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
513 &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
514 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
515 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
516 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
517 the Free Software Foundation.
518 
519   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
520 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
521 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
522 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
523 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
524 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
525 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
526 and reuse of software generally.
527 
528                             NO WARRANTY
529 
530   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
531 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
532 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
533 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
534 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
535 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
536 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
537 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
538 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
539 
540   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
541 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
542 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
543 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
544 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
545 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
546 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
547 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
548 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
549 DAMAGES.
550 
551                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
552 
553            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
554 
555   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
556 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
557 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
558 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
559 ordinary General Public License).
560 
561   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
562 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
563 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
564 &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
565 
566     &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
567     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
568 
569     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
570     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
571     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
572     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
573 
574     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
575     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
576     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
577     Lesser General Public License for more details.
578 
579     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
580     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
581     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, 
582     Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
583 
584 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
585 
586 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
587 school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if
588 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
589 
590   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
591   library `Frob&#39; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
592 
593   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
594   Ty Coon, President of Vice
595 
596 That&#39;s all there is to it!
