<span class="line-modified"> 36  * Native PRNG implementation for Solaris/Linux/MacOS.</span>
 37  * &lt;p&gt;
 38  * It obtains seed and random numbers by reading system files such as
 39  * the special device files /dev/random and /dev/urandom.  This
 40  * implementation respects the {@code securerandom.source} Security
 41  * property and {@code java.security.egd} System property for obtaining
 42  * seed material.  If the file specified by the properties does not
 43  * exist, /dev/random is the default seed source.  /dev/urandom is
 44  * the default source of random numbers.
 45  * &lt;p&gt;
 46  * On some Unix platforms, /dev/random may block until enough entropy is
 47  * available, but that may negatively impact the perceived startup
 48  * time.  By selecting these sources, this implementation tries to
 49  * strike a balance between performance and security.
 50  * &lt;p&gt;
 51  * generateSeed() and setSeed() attempt to directly read/write to the seed
 52  * source. However, this file may only be writable by root in many
 53  * configurations. Because we cannot just ignore bytes specified via
 54  * setSeed(), we keep a SHA1PRNG around in parallel.
 55  * &lt;p&gt;
 56  * nextBytes() reads the bytes directly from the source of random
