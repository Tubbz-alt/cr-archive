 113  * You can override the ticket cache location by using
 114  * {@code ticketCache}.
 115  * For Windows, if a ticket cannot be retrieved from the file ticket cache,
 116  * it will use Local Security Authority (LSA) API to get the TGT.
 117  * &lt;dt&gt;{@code ticketCache}:&lt;/dt&gt;
 118  * &lt;dd&gt;Set this to the name of the ticket
