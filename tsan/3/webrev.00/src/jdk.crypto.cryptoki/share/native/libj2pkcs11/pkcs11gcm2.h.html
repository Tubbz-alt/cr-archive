26 /* There is a known incompatibility for CK_GCM_PARAMS structure.
27  * PKCS#11 v2.40 standard mechanisms specification specifies
28  * CK_GCM_PARAMS as
29  *     typedef struct CK_GCM_PARAMS {
30  *         CK_BYTE_PTR       pIv;
31  *         CK_ULONG          ulIvLen;
32  *         CK_BYTE_PTR       pAAD;
33  *         CK_ULONG          ulAADLen;
34  *         CK_ULONG          ulTagBits;
35  *     } CK_GCM_PARAMS;
36  * However, the official header file of PKCS#11 v2.40 defines the
37  * CK_GCM_PARAMS with an extra &quot;ulIvBits&quot; field (type CK_ULONG).
38  * NSS uses the spec version while Solaris and SoftHSM2 use the header
39  * version. In order to work with both sides, SunPKCS11 provider defines
40  * the spec version of CK_GCM_PARAMS as CK_GCM_PARAMS_NO_IVBITS (as in this
41  * file) and uses it first before failing over to the header version.
