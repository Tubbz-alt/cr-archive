25  * Send your graphs to &lt;b&gt;IGV&lt;/b&gt; via a socket or a file. This package allows one to easily encode
26  * any graph-like data structure and send it for visualization to &lt;em&gt;OracleLab&#39;s Ideal Graph
27  * Visualizer&lt;/em&gt; tool. Assuming you already have your own data structure that contains
28  * &lt;b&gt;nodes&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;edges&lt;/b&gt; among them, creating a {@link org.graalvm.graphio.GraphOutput}
29  * specialized for your data is a matter of implementing a single interface:
30  *
31  * {@link org.graalvm.graphio.GraphJavadocSnippets#acmeGraphStructure}
32  *
33  * The {@link org.graalvm.graphio.GraphStructure} interface defines the set of operations that are
34  * needed by the &lt;em&gt;graph protocol&lt;/em&gt; to encode a graph into the &lt;b&gt;IGV&lt;/b&gt; expected format. The
35  * graph structure is implemented as a so called
36  * &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Singletonizer&quot;&gt;singletonizer&lt;/a&gt; API pattern: there is no
37  * need to change your data structures or implement some special interfaces - everything needed is
38  * provided by implementing the {@link org.graalvm.graphio.GraphStructure} operations.
39  * &lt;p&gt;
40  * The next step is to turn this graph structure into an instance of
41  * {@link org.graalvm.graphio.GraphOutput}. To do so use the associated
42  * {@link org.graalvm.graphio.GraphOutput.Builder builder} just like shown in the following method:
43  *
44  * {@link org.graalvm.graphio.GraphJavadocSnippets#buildOutput}
45  *
46  * Now you are ready to dump your graph into &lt;b&gt;IGV&lt;/b&gt;. Where to obtain the right channel? One
47  * option is to create a {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel} and dump the data into a file
48  * (preferrably with &lt;code&gt;.bgv&lt;/code&gt; extension). The other is to open a socket to port
49  * &lt;code&gt;4445&lt;/code&gt; (the default port &lt;b&gt;IGV&lt;/b&gt; listens to) and dump the data there. Here is an
50  * example:
51  *
52  * {@link org.graalvm.graphio.GraphJavadocSnippets#dump}
53  *
54  * Call the {@code dump} method with pointer to file {@code diamond.bgv} and then you can open the
55  * file in &lt;b&gt;IGV&lt;/b&gt;. The result will look like this:
56  * &lt;p&gt;
57  * &lt;img src=&quot;doc-files/diamond.png&quot;&gt;
58  * &lt;p&gt;
59  * You can verify the behavior directly in the &lt;b&gt;IGV&lt;/b&gt; by downloading
60  * &lt;a href=&quot;doc-files/diamond.bgv&quot;&gt;diamond.bgv&lt;/a&gt; file generated from the above diamond structure
61  * graph.
62  * &lt;p&gt;
63  * The primary &lt;b&gt;IGV&lt;/b&gt; focus is on graphs used by the compiler. As such they aren&#39;t plain graphs,
64  * but contain various compiler oriented attributes:
65  * &lt;ul&gt;
66  * &lt;li&gt;{@linkplain org.graalvm.graphio.GraphBlocks code blocks} information&lt;/li&gt;
67  * &lt;li&gt;{@linkplain org.graalvm.graphio.GraphElements method and fields} information&lt;/li&gt;
68  * &lt;li&gt;Advanced support for {@linkplain org.graalvm.graphio.GraphTypes recognizing types}&lt;/li&gt;
69  * &lt;/ul&gt;
70  * all these additional interfaces ({@link org.graalvm.graphio.GraphBlocks},
71  * {@link org.graalvm.graphio.GraphElements} and {@link org.graalvm.graphio.GraphTypes}) are
72  * optional - they don&#39;t have to be provided. As such they can be specified via
73  * {@link org.graalvm.graphio.GraphOutput.Builder} instance methods, which may, but need not be
74  * called at all. Here is an example:
75  *
76  * {@link org.graalvm.graphio.GraphJavadocSnippets#buildAll}
77  *
78  * All these interfaces follow the
79  * &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Singletonizer&quot;&gt;singletonizer&lt;/a&gt; API pattern again - e.g.
80  * no need to change your existing data structures, just implement the operations provided by the
81  * interfaces you pass into the builder. By combining these interfaces together you can get as rich,
82  * colorful, source linked graphs as the compiler produces to describe its optimizations.
