30  * Covariant return types for some methods in the {@code java.nio.Buffer} were
31  * &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-4774077&quot;&gt;introduced in JDK 9&lt;/a&gt;.
32  *
33  * If calls to these methods are compiled with javac from JDK 9+ using {@code -target 8 -source 8}
34  * then the call sites will invoke the covariant methods in the subclass. For example:
35  *
36  * &lt;pre&gt;
37  * static void reset(ByteBuffer buf) {
38  *     buf.reset();
39  * }
40  * &lt;/pre&gt;
41  *
42  * will result in:
43  *
44  * &lt;pre&gt;
45  *    0: aload_0
46  *    1: invokevirtual #7  // Method java/nio/ByteBuffer.reset:()Ljava/nio/ByteBuffer;
47  *    4: pop
48  *    5: return
49  * &lt;/pre&gt;
50  *
51  * This will result in a {@link NoSuchMethodError} when run on JDK 8. The workaround for this is to
52  * {@linkplain #asBaseBuffer(Buffer) coerce} the receiver for calls to the covariant methods to
53  * {@link Buffer}.
