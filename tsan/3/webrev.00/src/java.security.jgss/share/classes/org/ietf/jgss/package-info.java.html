 26 /**
 27  * This package presents a framework that allows application developers to
 28  * make use of security services like authentication, data integrity and
 29  * data confidentiality from a variety of underlying security mechanisms
 30  * like Kerberos, using a unified API. The security mechanisms that an
 31  * application can
 32  * chose to use are identified with unique object identifiers. One example
 33  * of such a mechanism is the Kerberos v5 GSS-API mechanism (object
 34  * identifier 1.2.840.113554.1.2.2). This mechanism is available through
 35  * the default instance of the GSSManager class.&lt;p&gt;
 36  *
 37  * The GSS-API is defined in a language independent way in
 38  * &lt;a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2743.txt&gt;RFC 2743&lt;/a&gt;. The Java
 39  * language bindings are defined in
 40  * &lt;a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2853.txt&gt;RFC 2853&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 41  *
 42  * An application starts out by instantiating a {@code GSSManager}
 43  * which then serves as a factory for a security context. An application
 44  * can use specific principal names and credentials that are also created
 45  * using the GSSManager; or it can instantiate a
 46  * context with system defaults. It then goes through a context
 47  * establishment loop. Once a context is established with the
 48  * peer, authentication is complete. Data protection such as integrity
 49  * and confidentiality can then be obtained from this context.&lt;p&gt;
 50  *
 51  * The GSS-API does not perform any communication with the peer. It merely
 52  * produces tokens that the application must somehow transport to the
 53  * other end.
 54  *
 55  * &lt;h2 id=&quot;useSubjectCredsOnly&quot;&gt;Credential Acquisition&lt;/h2&gt;
 56  * The GSS-API itself does not dictate how an underlying mechanism
 57  * obtains the credentials that are needed for authentication. It is
 58  * assumed that prior to calling the GSS-API, these credentials are
 59  * obtained and stored in a location that the mechanism provider is
 60  * aware of. However, the default model in the Java platform will be
 61  * that mechanism providers must obtain credentials only from the private
 62  * or public credential sets associated with the
 63  * {@link javax.security.auth.Subject Subject} in the
 64  * current access control context.  The Kerberos v5
 65  * mechanism will search for the required INITIATE and ACCEPT credentials
 66  * ({@link javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosTicket KerberosTicket} and
 67  * {@link javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosKey KerberosKey}) in
 68  * the private credential set where as some other mechanism might look
 69  * in the public set or in both.  If the desired credential is not
 70  * present in the appropriate sets of the current Subject, the GSS-API
 71  * call must fail.&lt;p&gt;
 72  *
 73  * This model has the advantage that credential management
 74  * is simple and predictable from the applications point of view.  An
 75  * application, given the right permissions, can purge the credentials in
 76  * the Subject or renew them using standard Java API&#39;s.  If it purged
 77  * the credentials, it would be sure that the JGSS mechanism would fail,
 78  * or if it renewed a time based credential it would be sure that a JGSS
 79  * mechanism would succeed.&lt;p&gt;
 80  *
 81  * This model does require that a {@link
 82  * javax.security.auth.login JAAS login} be performed in order to
 83  * authenticate and populate a Subject that the JGSS mechanism can later
 84  * utilize. However, applications have the ability to relax this
 85  * restriction by means of a system property:
 86  * {@systemProperty javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly}. By default
 87  * this system property will be assumed to be {@code true} (even when
 88  * it is unset) indicating that providers must only use the credentials
 89  * that are present in the current Subject. However, if this property is
 90  * explicitly set to false by the application, then it indicates that
 91  * the provider is free to use any credentials cache of its choice. Such
 92  * a credential cache might be a disk cache, an in-memory cache, or even
 93  * just the current Subject itself.
