 35  * An annotation processing tool framework will {@linkplain
 36  * Processor#init provide an annotation processor with an object
 37  * implementing this interface} so the processor can use facilities
 38  * provided by the framework to write new files, report error
 39  * messages, and find other utilities.
 40  *
 41  * &lt;p&gt;Third parties may wish to provide value-add wrappers around the
 42  * facility objects from this interface, for example a {@code Filer}
 43  * extension that allows multiple processors to coordinate writing out
 44  * a single source file.  To enable this, for processors running in a
 45  * context where their side effects via the API could be visible to
 46  * each other, the tool infrastructure must provide corresponding
 47  * facility objects that are {@code .equals}, {@code Filer}s that are
 48  * {@code .equals}, and so on.  In addition, the tool invocation must
 49  * be able to be configured such that from the perspective of the
 50  * running annotation processors, at least the chosen subset of helper
 51  * classes are viewed as being loaded by the same class loader.
 52  * (Since the facility objects manage shared state, the implementation
 53  * of a wrapper class must know whether or not the same base facility
 54  * object has been wrapped before.)
