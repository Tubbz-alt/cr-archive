33  * A skeletal visitor for annotation values with default behavior
34  * appropriate for the {@link SourceVersion#RELEASE_8 RELEASE_8}
35  * source version.
36  *
37  * &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;WARNING:&lt;/b&gt; The {@code AnnotationValueVisitor} interface
38  * implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the
39  * future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures
40  * added to future versions of the Java&amp;trade; programming language.
41  * Therefore, methods whose names begin with {@code &quot;visit&quot;} may be
42  * added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
43  * classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
44  * methods with names beginning with {@code &quot;visit&quot;}.
45  *
46  * &lt;p&gt;When such a new visit method is added, the default
47  * implementation in this class will be to call the {@link
48  * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new abstract annotation
49  * value visitor class will also be introduced to correspond to the
50  * new language level; this visitor will have different default
51  * behavior for the visit method in question.  When the new visitor is
52  * introduced, all or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
53  *
54  * @param &lt;R&gt; the return type of this visitor&#39;s methods
55  * @param &lt;P&gt; the type of the additional parameter to this visitor&#39;s methods.
