34  * A skeletal visitor of types with default behavior appropriate for
35  * the {@link javax.lang.model.SourceVersion#RELEASE_7 RELEASE_7}
36  * source version.
37  *
38  * &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;WARNING:&lt;/b&gt; The {@code TypeVisitor} interface implemented
39  * by this class may have methods added to it in the future to
40  * accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures added to
41  * future versions of the Java&amp;trade; programming language.
42  * Therefore, methods whose names begin with {@code &quot;visit&quot;} may be
43  * added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
44  * classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
45  * methods with names beginning with {@code &quot;visit&quot;}.
46  *
47  * &lt;p&gt;When such a new visit method is added, the default
48  * implementation in this class will be to call the {@link
49  * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new abstract type visitor
50  * class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language
51  * level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the
52  * visit method in question.  When the new visitor is introduced, all
53  * or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
54  *
55  * @param &lt;R&gt; the return type of this visitor&#39;s methods.  Use {@link
56  *            Void} for visitors that do not need to return results.
57  * @param &lt;P&gt; the type of the additional parameter to this visitor&#39;s
58  *            methods.  Use {@code Void} for visitors that do not need an
59  *            additional parameter.
