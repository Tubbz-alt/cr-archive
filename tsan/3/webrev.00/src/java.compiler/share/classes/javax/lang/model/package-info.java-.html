27  * Classes and hierarchies of packages used to model the Java
28  * programming language.
29  *
30  * The members of this package and its subpackages are for use in
31  * language modeling and language processing tasks and APIs including,
32  * but not limited to, the {@linkplain javax.annotation.processing
33  * annotation processing} framework.
34  *
35  * &lt;p&gt; This language model follows a &lt;i&gt;mirror&lt;/i&gt;-based design; see
36  *
37  * &lt;blockquote&gt;
38  * Gilad Bracha and David Ungar. &lt;i&gt;Mirrors: Design Principles for
39  * Meta-level Facilities of Object-Oriented Programming Languages&lt;/i&gt;.
40  * In Proc. of the ACM Conf. on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems,
41  * Languages and Applications, October 2004.
42  * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
43  *
44  * In particular, the model makes a distinction between static
45  * language constructs, like the {@linkplain javax.lang.model.element
46  * element} representing {@code java.util.Set}, and the family of
47  * {@linkplain javax.lang.model.type types} that may be associated
48  * with an element, like the raw type {@code java.util.Set}, {@code
49  * java.util.Set&lt;String&gt;}, and {@code java.util.Set&lt;T&gt;}.
50  *
51  * &lt;p&gt; Unless otherwise specified, methods in this package will throw
52  * a {@code NullPointerException} if given a {@code null} argument.
