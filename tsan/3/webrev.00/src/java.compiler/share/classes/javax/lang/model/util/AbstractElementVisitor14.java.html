36  *           This class is associated with &lt;i&gt;records&lt;/i&gt;, a preview
37  *           feature of the Java language. Preview features
38  *           may be removed in a future release, or upgraded to permanent
39  *           features of the Java language.}
40  *
41  * A skeletal visitor of program elements with default behavior
42  * appropriate for the {@link SourceVersion#RELEASE_14 RELEASE_14}
43  * source version.
44  *
45  * &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;WARNING:&lt;/b&gt; The {@code ElementVisitor} interface
46  * implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the
47  * future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures
48  * added to future versions of the Java&amp;trade; programming language.
49  * Therefore, methods whose names begin with {@code &quot;visit&quot;} may be
50  * added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
51  * classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
52  * methods with names beginning with {@code &quot;visit&quot;}.
53  *
54  * &lt;p&gt;When such a new visit method is added, the default
55  * implementation in this class will be to call the {@link
56  * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new abstract element visitor
57  * class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language
58  * level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the
59  * visit method in question.  When the new visitor is introduced, all
60  * or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
61  *
62  * @param &lt;R&gt; the return type of this visitor&#39;s methods.  Use {@link
63  *            Void} for visitors that do not need to return results.
64  * @param &lt;P&gt; the type of the additional parameter to this visitor&#39;s
65  *            methods.  Use {@code Void} for visitors that do not need an
66  *            additional parameter.
67  *
