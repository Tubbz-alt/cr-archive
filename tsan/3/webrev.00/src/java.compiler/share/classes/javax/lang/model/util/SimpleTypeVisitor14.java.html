33  * A simple visitor of types with default behavior appropriate for
34  * source version {@link SourceVersion#RELEASE_14 RELEASE_14}.
35  *
36  * Visit methods corresponding to {@code RELEASE_14} and earlier
37  * language constructs call {@link #defaultAction defaultAction},
38  * passing their arguments to {@code defaultAction}&#39;s corresponding
39  * parameters.
40  *
41  * &lt;p&gt; Methods in this class may be overridden subject to their
42  * general contract.  Note that annotating methods in concrete
43  * subclasses with {@link java.lang.Override @Override} will help
44  * ensure that methods are overridden as intended.
45  *
46  * &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;WARNING:&lt;/b&gt; The {@code TypeVisitor} interface implemented
47  * by this class may have methods added to it in the future to
48  * accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures added to
49  * future versions of the Java&amp;trade; programming language.
50  * Therefore, methods whose names begin with {@code &quot;visit&quot;} may be
51  * added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
52  * classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
53  * methods with names beginning with {@code &quot;visit&quot;}.
54  *
55  * &lt;p&gt;When such a new visit method is added, the default
56  * implementation in this class will be to call the {@link
57  * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new simple type visitor
58  * class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language
59  * level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the
60  * visit method in question.  When the new visitor is introduced, all
61  * or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
62  *
63  * @param &lt;R&gt; the return type of this visitor&#39;s methods.  Use {@link
64  *            Void} for visitors that do not need to return results.
65  * @param &lt;P&gt; the type of the additional parameter to this visitor&#39;s
66  *            methods.  Use {@code Void} for visitors that do not need an
67  *            additional parameter.
68  *
