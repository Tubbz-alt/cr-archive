 34 /**
 35  * A scanning visitor of program elements with default behavior
 36  * appropriate for the {@link SourceVersion#RELEASE_8 RELEASE_8}
 37  * source version.  The &lt;code&gt;visit&lt;i&gt;Xyz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; methods in this
 38  * class scan their component elements by calling {@code scan} on
 39  * their {@linkplain Element#getEnclosedElements enclosed elements},
 40  * {@linkplain ExecutableElement#getParameters parameters}, etc., as
 41  * indicated in the individual method specifications.  A subclass can
 42  * control the order elements are visited by overriding the
 43  * &lt;code&gt;visit&lt;i&gt;Xyz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; methods.  Note that clients of a scanner
 44  * may get the desired behavior be invoking {@code v.scan(e, p)} rather
 45  * than {@code v.visit(e, p)} on the root objects of interest.
 46  *
 47  * &lt;p&gt;When a subclass overrides a &lt;code&gt;visit&lt;i&gt;Xyz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; method, the
 48  * new method can cause the enclosed elements to be scanned in the
 49  * default way by calling &lt;code&gt;super.visit&lt;i&gt;Xyz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  In this
 50  * fashion, the concrete visitor can control the ordering of traversal
 51  * over the component elements with respect to the additional
 52  * processing; for example, consistently calling
 53  * &lt;code&gt;super.visit&lt;i&gt;Xyz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt; at the start of the overridden
 54  * methods will yield a preorder traversal, etc.  If the component
 55  * elements should be traversed in some other order, instead of
 56  * calling &lt;code&gt;super.visit&lt;i&gt;Xyz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, an overriding visit method
 57  * should call {@code scan} with the elements in the desired order.
 58  *
 59  * &lt;p&gt; Methods in this class may be overridden subject to their
 60  * general contract.  Note that annotating methods in concrete
 61  * subclasses with {@link java.lang.Override @Override} will help
 62  * ensure that methods are overridden as intended.
 63  *
 64  * &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;WARNING:&lt;/b&gt; The {@code ElementVisitor} interface
 65  * implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the
 66  * future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures
 67  * added to future versions of the Java&amp;trade; programming language.
 68  * Therefore, methods whose names begin with {@code &quot;visit&quot;} may be
 69  * added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
 70  * classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
 71  * methods with names beginning with {@code &quot;visit&quot;}.
 72  *
 73  * &lt;p&gt;When such a new visit method is added, the default
 74  * implementation in this class will be to call the {@link
 75  * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new element scanner visitor
 76  * class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language
 77  * level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the
 78  * visit method in question.  When the new visitor is introduced, all
 79  * or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
 80  *
 81  * @param &lt;R&gt; the return type of this visitor&#39;s methods.  Use {@link
 82  *            Void} for visitors that do not need to return results.
 83  * @param &lt;P&gt; the type of the additional parameter to this visitor&#39;s
 84  *            methods.  Use {@code Void} for visitors that do not need an
 85  *            additional parameter.
