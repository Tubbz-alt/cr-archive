 27  * Interfaces used to model elements of the Java programming language.
 28  *
 29  * The term &quot;element&quot; in this package is used to refer to program
 30  * elements, the declared entities that make up a program.  Elements
 31  * include classes, interfaces, methods, constructors, and fields.
 32  * The interfaces in this package do not model the structure of a
 33  * program inside a method body; for example there is no
 34  * representation of a {@code for} loop or {@code try}-{@code finally}
 35  * block.  However, the interfaces can model some structures only
 36  * appearing inside method bodies, such as local variables and
 37  * anonymous classes.
 38  *
 39  * &lt;p&gt;When used in the context of annotation processing, an accurate
 40  * model of the element being represented must be returned.  As this
 41  * is a language model, the source code provides the fiducial
 42  * (reference) representation of the construct in question rather than
 43  * a representation in an executable output like a class file.
 44  * Executable output may serve as the basis for creating a modeling
 45  * element.  However, the process of translating source code to
 46  * executable output may not permit recovering some aspects of the
 47  * source code representation.  For example, annotations with
 48  * {@linkplain java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy#SOURCE source}
 49  * {@linkplain java.lang.annotation.Retention retention} cannot be
 50  * recovered from class files and class files might not be able to
 51  * provide source position information.
 52  *
 53  * Names of parameters may not be recoverable from class files.
 54  *
 55  * The {@linkplain javax.lang.model.element.Modifier modifiers} on an
 56  * element created from a class file may differ in some cases from an
 57  * element for the same declaration created from a source file
 58  * including:
 59  *
 60  * &lt;ul&gt;
 61  * &lt;li&gt; {@code strictfp} on a class or interface
 62  * &lt;li&gt; {@code final} on a parameter
 63  * &lt;li&gt; {@code protected}, {@code private}, and {@code static} on classes and interfaces
 64  * &lt;/ul&gt;
 65  *
 66  * Some elements which are {@linkplain
 67  * javax.lang.model.util.Elements.Origin#MANDATED mandated} may not be
 68  * marked as such when created from class files.
 69  *
 70  * Additionally, {@linkplain
 71  * javax.lang.model.util.Elements.Origin#SYNTHETIC synthetic}
 72  * constructs in a class file, such as accessor methods used in
 73  * implementing nested classes and {@linkplain
 74  * javax.lang.model.util.Elements.Origin#isBridge(ExecutableElement)
 75  * bridge methods} used in implementing covariant returns, are
 76  * translation artifacts strictly outside of this model. However, when
 77  * operating on class files, it is helpful be able to operate on such
 78  * elements, screening them out when appropriate.
 79  *
 80  * &lt;p&gt;During annotation processing, operating on incomplete or
 81  * erroneous programs is necessary; however, there are fewer
 82  * guarantees about the nature of the resulting model.  If the source
 83  * code is not syntactically well-formed or has some other
 84  * irrecoverable error that could not be removed by the generation of
 85  * new types, a model may or may not be provided as a quality of
 86  * implementation issue.
 87  * If a program is syntactically valid but erroneous in some other
 88  * fashion, any returned model must have no less information than if
 89  * all the method bodies in the program were replaced by {@code &quot;throw
 90  * new RuntimeException();&quot;}.  If a program refers to a missing type Xyz,
 91  * the returned model must contain no less information than if the
 92  * declaration of type Xyz were assumed to be {@code &quot;class Xyz {}&quot;},
 93  * {@code &quot;interface Xyz {}&quot;}, {@code &quot;enum Xyz {}&quot;}, or {@code
 94  * &quot;@interface Xyz {}&quot;}. If a program refers to a missing type {@code
 95  * Xyz&lt;K1, ... ,Kn&gt;}, the returned model must contain no less
 96  * information than if the declaration of Xyz were assumed to be
 97  * {@code &quot;class Xyz&lt;T1, ... ,Tn&gt; {}&quot;} or {@code &quot;interface Xyz&lt;T1,
 98  * ... ,Tn&gt; {}&quot;}
 99  *
100  * &lt;p&gt; Unless otherwise specified in a particular implementation, the
101  * collections returned by methods in this package should be expected
102  * to be unmodifiable by the caller and unsafe for concurrent access.
103  *
104  * &lt;p&gt; Unless otherwise specified, methods in this package will throw
105  * a {@code NullPointerException} if given a {@code null} argument.
