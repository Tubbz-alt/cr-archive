35  * A skeletal visitor of program elements with default behavior
36  * appropriate for source versions {@link SourceVersion#RELEASE_9
37  * RELEASE_9} through {@link SourceVersion#RELEASE_13 RELEASE_13}.
38  *
39  * &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;WARNING:&lt;/b&gt; The {@code ElementVisitor} interface
40  * implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the
41  * future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures
42  * added to future versions of the Java&amp;trade; programming language.
43  * Therefore, methods whose names begin with {@code &quot;visit&quot;} may be
44  * added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
45  * classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
46  * methods with names beginning with {@code &quot;visit&quot;}.
47  *
48  * &lt;p&gt;When such a new visit method is added, the default
49  * implementation in this class will be to call the {@link
50  * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new abstract element visitor
51  * class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language
52  * level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the
53  * visit method in question.  When the new visitor is introduced, all
54  * or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
55  *
56  * @param &lt;R&gt; the return type of this visitor&#39;s methods.  Use {@link
57  *            Void} for visitors that do not need to return results.
58  * @param &lt;P&gt; the type of the additional parameter to this visitor&#39;s
59  *            methods.  Use {@code Void} for visitors that do not need an
60  *            additional parameter.
61  *

63  * @see AbstractElementVisitor7
