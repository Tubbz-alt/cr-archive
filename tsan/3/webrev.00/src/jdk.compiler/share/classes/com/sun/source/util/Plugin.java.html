32  * The interface for a javac plug-in.
33  *
34  * &lt;p&gt;The javac plug-in mechanism allows a user to specify one or more plug-ins
35  * on the javac command line, to be started soon after the compilation
36  * has begun. Plug-ins are identified by a user-friendly name. Each plug-in that
37  * is started will be passed an array of strings, which may be used to
38  * provide the plug-in with values for any desired options or other arguments.
39  *
40  * &lt;p&gt;Plug-ins are located via a {@link ServiceLoader},
41  * using the same class path as annotation processors (i.e.
42  * {@link StandardLocation#ANNOTATION_PROCESSOR_PATH ANNOTATION_PROCESSOR_PATH} or
43  * {@code -processorpath}).
44  *
45  * &lt;p&gt;It is expected that a typical plug-in will simply register a
46  * {@link TaskListener} to be informed of events during the execution
47  * of the compilation, and that the rest of the work will be done
48  * by the task listener.
49  *
