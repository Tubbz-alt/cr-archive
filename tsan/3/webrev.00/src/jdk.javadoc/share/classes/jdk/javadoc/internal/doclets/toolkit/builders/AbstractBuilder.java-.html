 40  * The superclass for all builders.  A builder is a class that provides
 41  * the structure and content of API documentation.  A builder is completely
 42  * doclet independent which means that any doclet can use builders to
 43  * construct documentation, as long as it implements the appropriate
 44  * writer interfaces.  For example, if a doclet wanted to use
 45  * {@link ConstantsSummaryBuilder} to build a constant summary, all it has to
 46  * do is implement the ConstantsSummaryWriter interface and pass it to the
 47  * builder using a WriterFactory.
 48  *
 49  *  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is NOT part of any supported API.
 50  *  If you write code that depends on this, you do so at your own risk.
 51  *  This code and its internal interfaces are subject to change or
 52  *  deletion without notice.&lt;/b&gt;
