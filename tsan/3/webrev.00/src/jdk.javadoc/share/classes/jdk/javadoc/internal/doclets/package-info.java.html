27  *  Doclets provide the user-selectable back ends for processing the
28  *  documentation comments in Java source code.
29  *
30  *  &lt;p&gt;Doclets are implementations of the {@link jdk.javadoc.doclet Doclet API}.&lt;/p&gt;
31  *
32  *  &lt;p&gt;Currently, there is only one supported doclet, the
33  *  {@link jdk.javadoc.internal.doclets.formats.html.HtmlDoclet HtmlDoclet},
34  *  for writing API documentation in HTML. Nevertheless, in order to
35  *  separate the high-level code for the general content of each page
36  *  from the low-level details of how to write such content, the code is
37  *  organized in two sections: a format-neutral
38  *  {@link jdk.javadoc.internal.doclets.toolkit toolkit API},
39  *  and a specific {@link jdk.javadoc.internal.doclets.formats format},
40  *  such as {@link jdk.javadoc.internal.doclets.formats.html HTML format}.
41  *
42  *  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is NOT part of any supported API.
43  *  If you write code that depends on this, you do so at your own risk.
44  *  This code and its internal interfaces are subject to change or
45  *  deletion without notice.&lt;/b&gt;
