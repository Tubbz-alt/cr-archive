  The JNDI SPI provides the means for creating JNDI service providers,

  The service provider package allows different implementations to be plugged in
  dynamically.
  These different implementations include those for the
  &lt;em&gt;initial context&lt;/em&gt;,
  and implementations for contexts that can be reached 
  from the initial context.

  For example, when looking up a printer name from the directory,
  it is natural for you to expect to get
  back a printer object on which to operate.

  JNDI operations allow applications to supply names that span multiple
  naming systems.  So in the process of completing
  an operation, one service provider might need to interact
  with another service provider, for example, to pass on
