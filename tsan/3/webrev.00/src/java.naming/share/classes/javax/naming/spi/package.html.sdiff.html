31 Provides the means for dynamically plugging in support for accessing
32 naming and directory services through the &lt;code&gt;javax.naming&lt;/code&gt;
33 and related packages.
34 
35 &lt;p&gt;
36 This package defines the service provider interface (SPI) of the Java Naming
37 and Directory Interface&amp;trade; (JNDI). &amp;nbsp;
38 JNDI provides naming and directory functionality to applications
39 written in the Java programming language.  It is designed to be
40 independent of any specific naming or directory service
41 implementation.  Thus a variety of services--new, emerging, and
42 already deployed ones--can be accessed in a common way.
43 
44 &lt;p&gt;
45 The JNDI SPI provides the means for creating JNDI service providers,
46 through which JNDI applications access different naming and
47 directory services.
48 
49 
<span class="line-modified">50 &lt;h3&gt;Plug-in Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
51 
52 The service provider package allows different implementations to be plugged in
53 dynamically.
54 These different implementations include those for the
55 &lt;em&gt;initial context&lt;/em&gt;,
56 and implementations for contexts that can be reached 
57 from the initial context.
58 
<span class="line-modified">59 &lt;h3&gt;Java Object Support&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
60 
61 The service provider package provides support
62 for implementors of the
63 &lt;code&gt;javax.naming.Context.lookup()&lt;/code&gt;
64 method and related methods to return Java objects that are natural
65 and intuitive for the Java programmer.
66 For example, when looking up a printer name from the directory,
67 it is natural for you to expect to get
68 back a printer object on which to operate.
69 
70 
<span class="line-modified">71 &lt;h3&gt;Multiple Naming Systems (Federation)&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
72 
73 JNDI operations allow applications to supply names that span multiple
74 naming systems.  So in the process of completing
75 an operation, one service provider might need to interact
76 with another service provider, for example, to pass on
77 the operation to be continued in the next naming system.
78 The service provider package provides support for
79 different providers to cooperate to complete JNDI operations.
80 
81 
82 &lt;h2&gt;Package Specification&lt;/h2&gt;
83 
84 The JNDI SPI Specification and related documents can be found in the
85 {@extLink jndi_overview JNDI documentation}.
