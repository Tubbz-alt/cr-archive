31 Extends the &lt;code&gt;javax.naming&lt;/code&gt; package to provide functionality
32 for accessing directory services.
33 
34 &lt;p&gt;
35 This package defines the directory operations of the Java Naming and
36 Directory Interface&amp;trade; (JNDI). &amp;nbsp;
37 JNDI provides naming and directory functionality to applications
38 written in the Java programming language.  It is designed to be
39 independent of any specific naming or directory service
40 implementation.  Thus a variety of services--new, emerging, and
41 already deployed ones--can be accessed in a common way.
42 
43 &lt;p&gt;
44 This package allows applications to retrieve and update attributes
45 associated with objects stored in a directory, and to search for
46 objects using specified attributes.
47 
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">48 &lt;h3&gt;The Directory Context&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
49 
50 The &lt;code&gt;DirContext&lt;/code&gt;
51 interface represents a &lt;em&gt;directory context&lt;/em&gt;.
52 It defines methods for examining and updating attributes associated with a
53 &lt;em&gt;directory object&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;directory entry&lt;/em&gt; as it is sometimes
54 called.
55 &lt;p&gt;
56 You use	&lt;code&gt;getAttributes()&lt;/code&gt; to retrieve the attributes
57 associated with a directory object (for which you supply the name).
58 Attributes are modified using &lt;code&gt;modifyAttributes()&lt;/code&gt;.
59 You can add, replace, or remove attributes and/or attribute values
60 using this operation.
61 &lt;p&gt;
62 &lt;code&gt;DirContext&lt;/code&gt; also behaves as a naming context
63 by extending the &lt;code&gt;Context&lt;/code&gt; interface in the &lt;code&gt;javax.naming&lt;/code&gt; package.
64 This means that any directory object can also provide
65 a naming context. 
66 For example, the directory object for a person might contain
67 the attributes of that person, and at the same time provide
68 a context for naming objects relative to that person
69 such as his printers and home directory.
70 
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a><span class="line-modified">71 &lt;h4&gt;Searches&lt;/h4&gt;</span>
72 &lt;code&gt;DirContext&lt;/code&gt; contains methods for
73 performing content-based searching of the directory.
74 In the simplest and most common form of usage, the application
75 specifies a set of attributes--possibly with specific
76 values--to match, and submits this attribute set, to the
77 &lt;code&gt;search()&lt;/code&gt; method.
78 There are other overloaded forms of &lt;code&gt;search()&lt;/code&gt;
79 that support more sophisticated &lt;em&gt;search filters&lt;/em&gt;.

85 {@extLink jndi_overview JNDI documentation}.
