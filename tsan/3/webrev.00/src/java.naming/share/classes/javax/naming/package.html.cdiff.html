  In JNDI, all naming and directory operations are performed relative
  to a context. There are no absolute roots.
  Therefore JNDI defines an &lt;em&gt;initial context&lt;/em&gt;, 
  &lt;code&gt;InitialContext&lt;/code&gt;,
  which provides a starting point for naming and directory operations.
  Once you have an initial context, you can use it to
  look up other contexts and objects.

  JNDI defines a class hierarchy for exceptions that can be thrown in
  the course of performing naming and directory operations.  The root of
  this class hierarchy is &lt;code&gt;NamingException&lt;/code&gt;.
