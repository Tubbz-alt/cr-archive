  &lt;p&gt;
  This package defines a &lt;code&gt;NamingEvent&lt;/code&gt; class to represent an event
  that is generated by a naming/directory service.
  It also defines subinterfaces of &lt;code&gt;Context&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DirContext&lt;/code&gt;,
  called &lt;code&gt;EventContext&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;EventDirContext&lt;/code&gt;,

  When an event is dispatched to a listener, the listener method (such

  will later invoke the listeners in newly-created threads.  As &lt;code&gt;Context&lt;/code&gt;
  instances are not guaranteed to be thread-safe in general, all context
  operations must be synchronized as needed.

  When a listener registers for events with a context, the context might
  need to do some internal processing in order to collect information
  required to generate the events.  The context, for example, might need
  to make a request to the server to register interest in changes
