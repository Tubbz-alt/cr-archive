 32 Provides support for LDAPv3 extended operations and controls.
 33 
 34 &lt;p&gt;
 35 This package extends the directory operations of the Java Naming and
 36 Directory Interface&amp;trade; (JNDI). &amp;nbsp;
 37 JNDI provides naming and directory functionality to applications
 38 written in the Java programming language.  It is designed to be
 39 independent of any specific naming or directory service
 40 implementation.  Thus a variety of services--new, emerging, and
 41 already deployed ones--can be accessed in a common way.
 42 
 43 &lt;p&gt;
 44 This package is for applications and service providers that deal with
 45 LDAPv3 extended operations and controls, as defined by
 46 &lt;a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt&gt;RFC 2251&lt;/a&gt;.
 47 The core interface in this package is &lt;code&gt;LdapContext&lt;/code&gt;, which defines
 48 methods on a context for performing extended operations and handling
 49 controls.
 50 
<span class="line-modified"> 51 &lt;h3&gt;Extended Operations&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
 52 &lt;p&gt;
 53 This package defines the interface &lt;code&gt;ExtendedRequest&lt;/code&gt;
 54 to represent the argument to an extended operation,
 55 and the interface &lt;code&gt;ExtendedResponse&lt;/code&gt; to represent the result
 56 of the extended operation.
 57 An extended response is always paired with an extended request
 58 but not necessarily vice versa. That is, you can have an extended request
 59 that has no corresponding extended response.
 60 &lt;p&gt;
 61 An application typically does not deal directly with these interfaces.
 62 Instead, it deals with classes that &lt;em&gt;implement&lt;/em&gt; these
 63 interfaces.  
 64 The application gets these classes either as part of a
 65 repertoire of extended operations standardized through the IETF, or
 66 from directory vendors for vendor-specific extended operations.
 67 The request classes should have constructors that accept
 68 arguments in a type-safe and user-friendly manner, while the
 69 response classes should have access methods for getting the data
 70 of the response in a type-safe and user-friendly manner.
 71 Internally, the request/response classes deal with encoding and decoding

110         // check validity of id
111         long time =  ... // decode berValue to get time

120         return // berValue saved;

123         return GETTIME_RESP_OID;
124     }

126 &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
127 
<span class="line-modified">128 &lt;h3&gt;Controls&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
129 
130 This package defines the interface &lt;code&gt;Control&lt;/code&gt; to represent an LDAPv3
131 control. It can be a control that is sent to an LDAP server
132 (&lt;em&gt;request control&lt;/em&gt;) or a control returned by an LDAP server
133 (&lt;em&gt;response control&lt;/em&gt;).  Unlike extended requests and responses,
134 there is not necessarily any pairing between request controls and
135 response controls.  You can send request controls and expect no
136 response controls back, or receive response controls without sending
137 any request controls.
138 &lt;p&gt;
139 An application typically does not deal directly with this interface.
140 Instead, it deals with classes that &lt;em&gt;implement&lt;/em&gt; this interface.
141 The application gets control classes either as part of a repertoire of
142 controls standardized through the IETF, or from directory vendors for
143 vendor-specific controls.  The request control classes should have
144 constructors that accept arguments in a type-safe and user-friendly
145 manner, while the response control classes should have access methods
146 for getting the data of the response in a type-safe and user-friendly
147 manner.  Internally, the request/response control classes deal with
148 encoding and decoding BER values.
