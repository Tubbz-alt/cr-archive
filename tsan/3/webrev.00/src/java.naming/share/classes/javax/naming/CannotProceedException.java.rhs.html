 31   * This exception is thrown to indicate that the operation reached
 32   * a point in the name where the operation cannot proceed any further.
 33   * When performing an operation on a composite name, a naming service
 34   * provider may reach a part of the name that does not belong to its
 35   * namespace.  At that point, it can construct a
 36   * CannotProceedException and then invoke methods provided by
 37   * javax.naming.spi.NamingManager (such as getContinuationContext())
 38   * to locate another provider to continue the operation.  If this is
 39   * not possible, this exception is raised to the caller of the
 40   * context operation.
 41   *&lt;p&gt;
 42   * If the program wants to handle this exception in particular, it
 43   * should catch CannotProceedException explicitly before attempting to
 44   * catch NamingException.
 45   *&lt;p&gt;
 46   * A CannotProceedException instance is not synchronized against concurrent
 47   * multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify
 48   * CannotProceedException should lock the object.
