 47 .SH DESCRIPTION
 48 .PP
 49 \f[B]Deprecation Note:\f[R] The rmic tool has been deprecated and is
 50 subject to removal in a future release.
 51 Support for static generation of Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP)
 52 stubs and skeletons has been deprecated.
 53 Applications should use dynamically generated JRMP stubs, eliminating
 54 the need to use the rmic tool for JRMP\-based applications.
 55 .PP
 56 The \f[CB]rmic\f[R] compiler generates stub and skeleton class files using
 57 the JRMP.
 58 .PP
 59 \f[B]Note:\f[R]
 60 .PP
 61 The rmic compiler has been updated to remove the \f[CB]\-idl\f[R] and
 62 \f[CB]\-iiop\f[R] options and can no longer generate IDL or IIOP stubs and
 63 tie classes.
 64 .PP
 65 JRMP class files are generated from compiled Java programming language
 66 classes that are remote object implementation classes.
 67 A remote implementation class is a class that implements the interface
 68 \f[CB]java.rmi.Remote\f[R].
 69 The class names in the \f[CB]rmic\f[R] command must be for classes that
 70 were compiled successfully with the \f[CB]javac\f[R] command and must be
 71 fully package qualified.
 72 For example, running the \f[CB]rmic\f[R] command on the class file name
 73 \f[CB]HelloImpl\f[R] as shown here creates the
 74 \f[CB]HelloImpl_Stub.class\f[R] file in the \f[CB]hello\f[R] subdirectory
 75 (named for the class\[aq]s package):

 79 .RE
 80 .PP
 81 A skeleton for a remote object is a JRMP protocol server\-side entity
 82 that has a method that dispatches calls to the remote object
 83 implementation.
 84 .PP
 85 A stub is a client\-side proxy for a remote object that\[aq]s
 86 responsible for communicating method invocations on remote objects to
 87 the server where the actual remote object implementation resides.
 88 A client\[aq]s reference to a remote object, therefore, is actually a
 89 reference to a local stub.
 90 .PP
 91 By default, the \f[CB]rmic\f[R] command generates stub classes that use
 92 the 1.2 JRMP stub protocol version only, as though the \f[CB]\-v1.2\f[R]
 93 option were specified.
 94 See \f[B]Options for the rmic Compiler\f[R].
 95 .PP
 96 A stub implements only the remote interfaces, and not local interfaces
 97 that the remote object also implements.
 98 Because a JRMP stub implements the same set of remote interfaces as the
 99 remote object, a client can use the Java programming language built\-in
100 operators for casting and type checking.
101 .PP
102 \f[B]Note:\f[R]
103 .PP
104 The rmic compiler does not support reading of class files that have been
105 compiled with the \f[CB]\-\-enable\-preview\f[R] option, nor does it
106 support generation of stub or skeleton classes that have preview
107 features enabled.
108 .SH OPTIONS FOR THE RMIC COMPILER
109 .TP
110 .B \f[CB]\-bootclasspath\f[R] \f[I]path\f[R]
111 Overrides the location of bootstrap class files.
112 .RS
113 .RE
114 .TP
115 .B \f[CB]\-classpath\f[R] \f[I]path\f[R]
116 Specifies the path the \f[CB]rmic\f[R] command uses to look up classes.
117 This option overrides the default or the \f[CB]CLASSPATH\f[R] environment
118 variable when it is set.
119 Directories are separated by colons or semicolons, depending on your
120 operating system.
121 The following is the general format for \f[I]path\f[R]:

130 .RE
131 .TP
132 .B \f[CB]\-d\f[R] \f[I]directory\f[R]
133 Specifies the root destination directory for the generated class
134 hierarchy.
135 You can use this option to specify a destination directory for the stub,
136 skeleton, and tie files.

138 .IP \[bu] 2
139 \f[B]Oracle Solaris, Linux, and OS X:\f[R] For example, the following
140 command places the stub and skeleton classes derived from
141 \f[CB]MyClass\f[R] into the directory \f[CB]/java/classes/exampleclass\f[R]:

159 If the \f[CB]\-d\f[R] option isn\[aq]t specified, then the default
160 behavior is as though \f[CB]\-d\f[R] was specified.
161 The package hierarchy of the target class is created in the current
162 directory, and stub/tie/skeleton files are placed within it.
163 .RE
164 .TP
165 .B \f[CB]\-g\f[R]
166 Enables the generation of all debugging information, including local
167 variables.

170 .RE
171 .TP
172 .B \f[CB]\-J\f[R]\f[I]argument\f[R]
173 Used with any Java command, the \f[CB]\-J\f[R] option passes the
174 \f[I]argument\f[R] that follows it (no spaces between the \f[CB]\-J\f[R]
175 and the argument) to the Java interpreter.
176 .RS
177 .RE
178 .TP
179 .B \f[CB]\-keep\f[R] or \f[CB]\-keepgenerated\f[R]
180 Retains the generated \f[CB]\&amp;.java\f[R] source files for the stub,
181 skeleton, and tie classes and writes them to the same directory as
182 the\f[CB]\&amp;.class\f[R] files.

186 .B \f[CB]\-nowarn\f[R]

189 print warnings.

198 .B \f[CB]\-vcompat\f[R] (deprecated)
199 Generates stub and skeleton classes that are compatible with both the
200 1.1 and 1.2 JRMP stub protocol versions.
201 This option was the default in releases before 5.0.
202 The generated stub classes use the 1.1 stub protocol version when loaded
203 in a JDK 1.1 virtual machine and use the 1.2 stub protocol version when
204 loaded into a 1.2 (or later) virtual machine.
205 The generated skeleton classes support both 1.1 and 1.2 stub protocol
206 versions.
207 The generated classes are relatively large to support both modes of
208 operation.

222 .TP
223 .B \f[CB]\-v1.1\f[R] (deprecated)
224 Generates stub and skeleton classes for the 1.1 JRMP stub protocol
225 version only.
226 The \f[CB]\-v1.1\f[R] option is useful only for generating stub classes
227 that are serialization\-compatible with existing, statically deployed
228 stub classes generated by the \f[CB]rmic\f[R] command from JDK 1.1 that
229 can\[aq]t be upgraded (and dynamic class loading isn\[aq]t being used).

237 .TP
238 .B \f[CB]\-v1.2\f[R] (deprecated)
239 (Default) Generates stub classes for the 1.2 JRMP stub protocol version
240 only.
241 No skeleton classes are generated because skeleton classes aren\[aq]t
242 used with the 1.2 stub protocol version.
243 The generated stub classes don\[aq]t work when they\[aq]re loaded into a
244 JDK 1.1 virtual machine.
