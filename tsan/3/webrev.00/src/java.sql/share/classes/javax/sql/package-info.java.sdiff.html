 27  * Provides the API for server side data source access and processing from
 28  * the Java&amp;trade; programming language.
<span class="line-modified"> 29  * This package supplements the &lt;code&gt;java.sql&lt;/code&gt;</span>
 30  * package and, as of the version 1.4 release, is included in the
 31  * Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE&amp;trade;).
 32  * It remains an essential part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition
 33  * (Java EE&amp;trade;).
 34  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 35  * The &lt;code&gt;javax.sql&lt;/code&gt; package provides for the following:</span>
 36  * &lt;OL&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 37  * &lt;LI&gt;The &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt; interface as an alternative to the</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 38  * &lt;code&gt;DriverManager&lt;/code&gt; for establishing a</span>
 39  * connection with a data source
 40  * &lt;LI&gt;Connection pooling and Statement pooling
 41  * &lt;LI&gt;Distributed transactions
 42  * &lt;LI&gt;Rowsets
 43  * &lt;/OL&gt;
 44  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 45  * Applications use the &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt;</span>
 46  * APIs directly, but the connection pooling and distributed transaction
 47  * APIs are used internally by the middle-tier infrastructure.
 48  *
<span class="line-modified"> 49  * &lt;H2&gt;Using a &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt; Object to Make a Connection&lt;/H2&gt;</span>
 50  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 51  * The &lt;code&gt;javax.sql&lt;/code&gt; package provides the preferred</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 52  * way to make a connection with a data source.  The &lt;code&gt;DriverManager&lt;/code&gt;</span>
 53  * class, the original mechanism, is still valid, and code using it will
<span class="line-modified"> 54  * continue to run.  However, the newer &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt; mechanism</span>
 55  * is preferred because it offers many advantages over the
<span class="line-modified"> 56  * &lt;code&gt;DriverManager&lt;/code&gt; mechanism.</span>
 57  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 58  * These are the main advantages of using a &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt; object to</span>
 59  * make a connection:
 60  * &lt;UL&gt;
 61  *
 62  * &lt;LI&gt;Changes can be made to a data source&#39;s properties, which means
 63  * that it is not necessary to make changes in application code when
 64  * something about the data source or driver changes.
 65  * &lt;LI&gt;Connection  and Statement pooling and distributed transactions are available
<span class="line-modified"> 66  * through a &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt; object that is</span>
 67  * implemented to work with the middle-tier infrastructure.
<span class="line-modified"> 68  * Connections made through the &lt;code&gt;DriverManager&lt;/code&gt;</span>
 69  * do not have connection and statement pooling or distributed transaction
 70  * capabilities.
 71  * &lt;/UL&gt;
 72  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 73  * Driver vendors provide &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt; implementations. A</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 74  * particular &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt; object represents a particular</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 75  * physical data source, and each connection the &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt; object</span>
 76  * creates is a connection to that physical data source.
 77  * &lt;p&gt;
 78  * A logical name for the data source is registered with a naming service that
 79  * uses the Java Naming and Directory Interface&amp;trade;
 80  * (JNDI) API, usually by a system administrator or someone performing the
 81  * duties of a system administrator. An application can retrieve the
<span class="line-modified"> 82  * &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt; object it wants by doing a lookup on the logical</span>
 83  * name that has been registered for it.  The application can then use the
<span class="line-modified"> 84  * &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt; object to create a connection to the physical data</span>
 85  * source it represents.
 86  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 87  * A &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt; object can be implemented to work with the</span>
 88  * middle tier infrastructure so that the connections it produces will be
<span class="line-modified"> 89  * pooled for reuse. An application that uses such a &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt;</span>
 90  * implementation will automatically get a connection that participates in
 91  * connection pooling.
<span class="line-modified"> 92  * A &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt; object can also be implemented to work with the</span>
 93  * middle tier infrastructure so that the connections it produces can be
 94  * used for distributed transactions without any special coding.
 95  *
 96  * &lt;H2&gt;Connection Pooling and Statement Pooling&lt;/H2&gt;
 97  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 98  * Connections made via a &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt;</span>
 99  * object that is implemented to work with a middle tier connection pool manager
100  * will participate in connection pooling.  This can improve performance
101  * dramatically because creating new connections is very expensive.
102  * Connection pooling allows a connection to be used and reused,
103  * thus cutting down substantially on the number of new connections
104  * that need to be created.
105  * &lt;p&gt;
106  * Connection pooling is totally transparent.  It is done automatically
107  * in the middle tier of a Java EE configuration, so from an application&#39;s
108  * viewpoint, no change in code is required. An application simply uses
<span class="line-modified">109  * the &lt;code&gt;DataSource.getConnection&lt;/code&gt; method to get the pooled</span>
<span class="line-modified">110  * connection and uses it the same way it uses any &lt;code&gt;Connection&lt;/code&gt;</span>
111  * object.
112  * &lt;p&gt;
113  * The classes and interfaces used for connection pooling are:
114  * &lt;UL&gt;
<span class="line-modified">115  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;ConnectionPoolDataSource&lt;/code&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">116  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">117  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;ConnectionEvent&lt;/code&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">118  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;ConnectionEventListener&lt;/code&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">119  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;StatementEvent&lt;/code&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">120  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;StatementEventListener&lt;/code&gt;</span>
121  * &lt;/UL&gt;
122  * The connection pool manager, a facility in the middle tier of
123  * a three-tier architecture, uses these classes and interfaces
<span class="line-modified">124  * behind the scenes.  When a &lt;code&gt;ConnectionPoolDataSource&lt;/code&gt; object</span>
<span class="line-modified">125  * is called on to create a &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object, the</span>
<span class="line-modified">126  * connection pool manager will register as a &lt;code&gt;ConnectionEventListener&lt;/code&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">127  * object with the new &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object.  When the connection</span>
128  * is closed or there is an error, the connection pool manager (being a listener)
<span class="line-modified">129  * gets a notification that includes a &lt;code&gt;ConnectionEvent&lt;/code&gt; object.</span>
130  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">131  * If the connection pool manager supports &lt;code&gt;Statement&lt;/code&gt; pooling, for</span>
<span class="line-modified">132  * &lt;code&gt;PreparedStatements&lt;/code&gt;, which can be determined by invoking the method</span>
<span class="line-modified">133  * &lt;code&gt;DatabaseMetaData.supportsStatementPooling&lt;/code&gt;,  the</span>
<span class="line-modified">134  * connection pool manager will register as a &lt;code&gt;StatementEventListener&lt;/code&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">135  * object with the new &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; object.  When the</span>
<span class="line-modified">136  * &lt;code&gt;PreparedStatement&lt;/code&gt; is closed or there is an error, the connection</span>
137  * pool manager (being a listener)
<span class="line-modified">138  * gets a notification that includes a &lt;code&gt;StatementEvent&lt;/code&gt; object.</span>
139  *
140  * &lt;H2&gt;Distributed Transactions&lt;/H2&gt;
141  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">142  * As with pooled connections, connections made via a &lt;code&gt;DataSource&lt;/code&gt;</span>
143  * object that is implemented to work with the middle tier infrastructure
144  * may participate in distributed transactions.  This gives an application
145  * the ability to involve data sources on multiple servers in a single
146  * transaction.
147  * &lt;p&gt;
148  * The classes and interfaces used for distributed transactions are:
149  * &lt;UL&gt;
<span class="line-modified">150  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;XADataSource&lt;/code&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">151  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;XAConnection&lt;/code&gt;</span>
152  * &lt;/UL&gt;
153  * These interfaces are used by the transaction manager; an application does
154  * not use them directly.
155  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">156  * The &lt;code&gt;XAConnection&lt;/code&gt; interface is derived from the</span>
<span class="line-modified">157  * &lt;code&gt;PooledConnection&lt;/code&gt; interface, so what applies to a pooled connection</span>
158  * also applies to a connection that is part of a distributed transaction.
159  * A transaction manager in the middle tier handles everything transparently.
160  * The only change in application code is that an application cannot do anything
161  * that would interfere with the transaction manager&#39;s handling of the transaction.
<span class="line-modified">162  * Specifically, an application cannot call the methods &lt;code&gt;Connection.commit&lt;/code&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">163  * or &lt;code&gt;Connection.rollback&lt;/code&gt;, and it cannot set the connection to be in</span>
164  * auto-commit mode (that is, it cannot call
<span class="line-modified">165  * &lt;code&gt;Connection.setAutoCommit(true)&lt;/code&gt;).</span>
166  * &lt;p&gt;
167  * An application does not need to do anything special to participate in a
168  * distributed transaction.
169  * It simply creates connections to the data sources it wants to use via
<span class="line-modified">170  * the &lt;code&gt;DataSource.getConnection&lt;/code&gt; method, just as it normally does.</span>
171  * The transaction manager manages the transaction behind the scenes.  The
<span class="line-modified">172  * &lt;code&gt;XADataSource&lt;/code&gt; interface creates &lt;code&gt;XAConnection&lt;/code&gt; objects, and</span>
<span class="line-modified">173  * each &lt;code&gt;XAConnection&lt;/code&gt; object creates an &lt;code&gt;XAResource&lt;/code&gt; object</span>
174  * that the transaction manager uses to manage the connection.
175  *
176  *
177  * &lt;H2&gt;Rowsets&lt;/H2&gt;
<span class="line-modified">178  * The &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt; interface works with various other classes and</span>
179  * interfaces behind the scenes. These can be grouped into three categories.
180  * &lt;OL&gt;
181  * &lt;LI&gt;Event Notification
182  * &lt;UL&gt;
<span class="line-modified">183  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;RowSetListener&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">184  * A &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt; object is a JavaBeans&amp;trade;</span>
185  * component because it has properties and participates in the JavaBeans
<span class="line-modified">186  * event notification mechanism. The &lt;code&gt;RowSetListener&lt;/code&gt; interface</span>
187  * is implemented by a component that wants to be notified about events that
<span class="line-modified">188  * occur to a particular &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt; object.  Such a component registers</span>
<span class="line-modified">189  * itself as a listener with a rowset via the &lt;code&gt;RowSet.addRowSetListener&lt;/code&gt;</span>
190  * method.
191  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">192  * When the &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt; object changes one of its rows, changes all of</span>
193  * it rows, or moves its cursor, it also notifies each listener that is registered
194  * with it.  The listener reacts by carrying out its implementation of the
195  * notification method called on it.
<span class="line-modified">196  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;RowSetEvent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">197  * As part of its internal notification process, a &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt; object</span>
<span class="line-modified">198  * creates an instance of &lt;code&gt;RowSetEvent&lt;/code&gt; and passes it to the listener.</span>
<span class="line-modified">199  * The listener can use this &lt;code&gt;RowSetEvent&lt;/code&gt; object to find out which rowset</span>
200  * had the event.
201  * &lt;/UL&gt;
202  * &lt;LI&gt;Metadata
203  * &lt;UL&gt;
<span class="line-modified">204  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;RowSetMetaData&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>
205  * This interface, derived from the
<span class="line-modified">206  * &lt;code&gt;ResultSetMetaData&lt;/code&gt; interface, provides information about</span>
<span class="line-modified">207  * the columns in a &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt; object.  An application can use</span>
<span class="line-modified">208  * &lt;code&gt;RowSetMetaData&lt;/code&gt; methods to find out how many columns the</span>
209  * rowset contains and what kind of data each column can contain.
210  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">211  * The &lt;code&gt;RowSetMetaData&lt;/code&gt; interface provides methods for</span>
212  * setting the information about columns, but an application would not
<span class="line-modified">213  * normally use these methods.  When an application calls the &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">214  * method &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt; object will contain</span>
<span class="line-modified">215  * a new set of rows, and its &lt;code&gt;RowSetMetaData&lt;/code&gt; object will have been</span>
216  * internally updated to contain information about the new columns.
217  * &lt;/UL&gt;
218  * &lt;LI&gt;The Reader/Writer Facility&lt;br&gt;
<span class="line-modified">219  * A &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt; object that implements the &lt;code&gt;RowSetInternal&lt;/code&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">220  * interface can call on the &lt;code&gt;RowSetReader&lt;/code&gt; object associated with it</span>
<span class="line-modified">221  * to populate itself with data.  It can also call on the &lt;code&gt;RowSetWriter&lt;/code&gt;</span>
222  * object associated with it to write any changes to its rows back to the
223  * data source from which it originally got the rows.
224  * A rowset that remains connected to its data source does not need to use a
225  * reader and writer because it can simply operate on the data source directly.
226  *
227  * &lt;UL&gt;
<span class="line-modified">228  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;RowSetInternal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">229  * By implementing the &lt;code&gt;RowSetInternal&lt;/code&gt; interface, a</span>
<span class="line-modified">230  * &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt; object gets access to</span>
231  * its internal state and is able to call on its reader and writer. A rowset
232  * keeps track of the values in its current rows and of the values that immediately
233  * preceded the current ones, referred to as the &lt;i&gt;original&lt;/i&gt; values.  A rowset
234  * also keeps track of (1) the parameters that have been set for its command and
235  * (2) the connection that was passed to it, if any.  A rowset uses the
<span class="line-modified">236  * &lt;code&gt;RowSetInternal&lt;/code&gt; methods behind the scenes to get access to</span>
237  * this information.  An application does not normally invoke these methods directly.
238  *
<span class="line-modified">239  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;RowSetReader&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">240  * A disconnected &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt; object that has implemented the</span>
<span class="line-modified">241  * &lt;code&gt;RowSetInternal&lt;/code&gt; interface can call on its reader (the</span>
<span class="line-modified">242  * &lt;code&gt;RowSetReader&lt;/code&gt; object associated with it) to populate it with</span>
<span class="line-modified">243  * data.  When an application calls the &lt;code&gt;RowSet.execute&lt;/code&gt; method,</span>
244  * that method calls on the rowset&#39;s reader to do much of the work. Implementations
245  * can vary widely, but generally a reader makes a connection to the data source,
246  * reads data from the data source and populates the rowset with it, and closes
<span class="line-modified">247  * the connection. A reader may also update the &lt;code&gt;RowSetMetaData&lt;/code&gt; object</span>
248  * for its rowset.  The rowset&#39;s internal state is also updated, either by the
<span class="line-modified">249  * reader or directly by the method &lt;code&gt;RowSet.execute&lt;/code&gt;.</span>
250  *
251  *
<span class="line-modified">252  * &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;RowSetWriter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">253  * A disconnected &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt; object that has implemented the</span>
<span class="line-modified">254  * &lt;code&gt;RowSetInternal&lt;/code&gt; interface can call on its writer (the</span>
<span class="line-modified">255  * &lt;code&gt;RowSetWriter&lt;/code&gt; object associated with it) to write changes</span>
256  * back to the underlying data source.  Implementations may vary widely, but
257  * generally, a writer will do the following:
258  *
259  * &lt;UL&gt;
260  * &lt;LI&gt;Make a connection to the data source
261  * &lt;LI&gt;Check to see whether there is a conflict, that is, whether
262  * a value that has been changed in the rowset has also been changed
263  * in the data source
264  * &lt;LI&gt;Write the new values to the data source if there is no conflict
265  * &lt;LI&gt;Close the connection
266  * &lt;/UL&gt;
267  *
268  *
269  * &lt;/UL&gt;
270  * &lt;/OL&gt;
271  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">272  * The &lt;code&gt;RowSet&lt;/code&gt; interface may be implemented in any number of</span>
273  * ways, and anyone may write an implementation. Developers are encouraged
274  * to use their imaginations in coming up with new ways to use rowsets.

 26 /**
 27  * Provides the API for server side data source access and processing from
 28  * the Java&amp;trade; programming language.
<span class="line-modified"> 29  * This package supplements the {@code java.sql}</span>
 30  * package and, as of the version 1.4 release, is included in the
 31  * Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE&amp;trade;).
 32  * It remains an essential part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition
 33  * (Java EE&amp;trade;).
 34  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 35  * The {@code javax.sql} package provides for the following:</span>
 36  * &lt;OL&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 37  * &lt;LI&gt;The {@code DataSource} interface as an alternative to the</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 38  * {@code DriverManager} for establishing a</span>
 39  * connection with a data source
 40  * &lt;LI&gt;Connection pooling and Statement pooling
 41  * &lt;LI&gt;Distributed transactions
 42  * &lt;LI&gt;Rowsets
 43  * &lt;/OL&gt;
 44  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 45  * Applications use the {@code DataSource} and {@code RowSet}</span>
 46  * APIs directly, but the connection pooling and distributed transaction
 47  * APIs are used internally by the middle-tier infrastructure.
 48  *
<span class="line-modified"> 49  * &lt;H2&gt;Using a {@code DataSource} Object to Make a Connection&lt;/H2&gt;</span>
 50  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 51  * The {@code javax.sql} package provides the preferred</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 52  * way to make a connection with a data source.  The {@code DriverManager}</span>
 53  * class, the original mechanism, is still valid, and code using it will
<span class="line-modified"> 54  * continue to run.  However, the newer {@code DataSource} mechanism</span>
 55  * is preferred because it offers many advantages over the
<span class="line-modified"> 56  * {@code DriverManager} mechanism.</span>
 57  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 58  * These are the main advantages of using a {@code DataSource} object to</span>
 59  * make a connection:
 60  * &lt;UL&gt;
 61  *
 62  * &lt;LI&gt;Changes can be made to a data source&#39;s properties, which means
 63  * that it is not necessary to make changes in application code when
 64  * something about the data source or driver changes.
 65  * &lt;LI&gt;Connection  and Statement pooling and distributed transactions are available
<span class="line-modified"> 66  * through a {@code DataSource} object that is</span>
 67  * implemented to work with the middle-tier infrastructure.
<span class="line-modified"> 68  * Connections made through the {@code DriverManager}</span>
 69  * do not have connection and statement pooling or distributed transaction
 70  * capabilities.
 71  * &lt;/UL&gt;
 72  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 73  * Driver vendors provide {@code DataSource} implementations. A</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 74  * particular {@code DataSource} object represents a particular</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 75  * physical data source, and each connection the {@code DataSource} object</span>
 76  * creates is a connection to that physical data source.
 77  * &lt;p&gt;
 78  * A logical name for the data source is registered with a naming service that
 79  * uses the Java Naming and Directory Interface&amp;trade;
 80  * (JNDI) API, usually by a system administrator or someone performing the
 81  * duties of a system administrator. An application can retrieve the
<span class="line-modified"> 82  * {@code DataSource} object it wants by doing a lookup on the logical</span>
 83  * name that has been registered for it.  The application can then use the
<span class="line-modified"> 84  * {@code DataSource} object to create a connection to the physical data</span>
 85  * source it represents.
 86  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 87  * A {@code DataSource} object can be implemented to work with the</span>
 88  * middle tier infrastructure so that the connections it produces will be
<span class="line-modified"> 89  * pooled for reuse. An application that uses such a {@code DataSource}</span>
 90  * implementation will automatically get a connection that participates in
 91  * connection pooling.
<span class="line-modified"> 92  * A {@code DataSource} object can also be implemented to work with the</span>
 93  * middle tier infrastructure so that the connections it produces can be
 94  * used for distributed transactions without any special coding.
 95  *
 96  * &lt;H2&gt;Connection Pooling and Statement Pooling&lt;/H2&gt;
 97  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 98  * Connections made via a {@code DataSource}</span>
 99  * object that is implemented to work with a middle tier connection pool manager
100  * will participate in connection pooling.  This can improve performance
101  * dramatically because creating new connections is very expensive.
102  * Connection pooling allows a connection to be used and reused,
103  * thus cutting down substantially on the number of new connections
104  * that need to be created.
105  * &lt;p&gt;
106  * Connection pooling is totally transparent.  It is done automatically
107  * in the middle tier of a Java EE configuration, so from an application&#39;s
108  * viewpoint, no change in code is required. An application simply uses
<span class="line-modified">109  * the {@code DataSource.getConnection} method to get the pooled</span>
<span class="line-modified">110  * connection and uses it the same way it uses any {@code Connection}</span>
111  * object.
112  * &lt;p&gt;
113  * The classes and interfaces used for connection pooling are:
114  * &lt;UL&gt;
<span class="line-modified">115  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code ConnectionPoolDataSource}</span>
<span class="line-modified">116  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code PooledConnection}</span>
<span class="line-modified">117  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code ConnectionEvent}</span>
<span class="line-modified">118  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code ConnectionEventListener}</span>
<span class="line-modified">119  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code StatementEvent}</span>
<span class="line-modified">120  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code StatementEventListener}</span>
121  * &lt;/UL&gt;
122  * The connection pool manager, a facility in the middle tier of
123  * a three-tier architecture, uses these classes and interfaces
<span class="line-modified">124  * behind the scenes.  When a {@code ConnectionPoolDataSource} object</span>
<span class="line-modified">125  * is called on to create a {@code PooledConnection} object, the</span>
<span class="line-modified">126  * connection pool manager will register as a {@code ConnectionEventListener}</span>
<span class="line-modified">127  * object with the new {@code PooledConnection} object.  When the connection</span>
128  * is closed or there is an error, the connection pool manager (being a listener)
<span class="line-modified">129  * gets a notification that includes a {@code ConnectionEvent} object.</span>
130  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">131  * If the connection pool manager supports {@code Statement} pooling, for</span>
<span class="line-modified">132  * {@code PreparedStatements}, which can be determined by invoking the method</span>
<span class="line-modified">133  * {@code DatabaseMetaData.supportsStatementPooling},  the</span>
<span class="line-modified">134  * connection pool manager will register as a {@code StatementEventListener}</span>
<span class="line-modified">135  * object with the new {@code PooledConnection} object.  When the</span>
<span class="line-modified">136  * {@code PreparedStatement} is closed or there is an error, the connection</span>
137  * pool manager (being a listener)
<span class="line-modified">138  * gets a notification that includes a {@code StatementEvent} object.</span>
139  *
140  * &lt;H2&gt;Distributed Transactions&lt;/H2&gt;
141  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">142  * As with pooled connections, connections made via a {@code DataSource}</span>
143  * object that is implemented to work with the middle tier infrastructure
144  * may participate in distributed transactions.  This gives an application
145  * the ability to involve data sources on multiple servers in a single
146  * transaction.
147  * &lt;p&gt;
148  * The classes and interfaces used for distributed transactions are:
149  * &lt;UL&gt;
<span class="line-modified">150  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code XADataSource}</span>
<span class="line-modified">151  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code XAConnection}</span>
152  * &lt;/UL&gt;
153  * These interfaces are used by the transaction manager; an application does
154  * not use them directly.
155  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">156  * The {@code XAConnection} interface is derived from the</span>
<span class="line-modified">157  * {@code PooledConnection} interface, so what applies to a pooled connection</span>
158  * also applies to a connection that is part of a distributed transaction.
159  * A transaction manager in the middle tier handles everything transparently.
160  * The only change in application code is that an application cannot do anything
161  * that would interfere with the transaction manager&#39;s handling of the transaction.
<span class="line-modified">162  * Specifically, an application cannot call the methods {@code Connection.commit}</span>
<span class="line-modified">163  * or {@code Connection.rollback}, and it cannot set the connection to be in</span>
164  * auto-commit mode (that is, it cannot call
<span class="line-modified">165  * {@code Connection.setAutoCommit(true)}).</span>
166  * &lt;p&gt;
167  * An application does not need to do anything special to participate in a
168  * distributed transaction.
169  * It simply creates connections to the data sources it wants to use via
<span class="line-modified">170  * the {@code DataSource.getConnection} method, just as it normally does.</span>
171  * The transaction manager manages the transaction behind the scenes.  The
<span class="line-modified">172  * {@code XADataSource} interface creates {@code XAConnection} objects, and</span>
<span class="line-modified">173  * each {@code XAConnection} object creates an {@code XAResource} object</span>
174  * that the transaction manager uses to manage the connection.
175  *
176  *
177  * &lt;H2&gt;Rowsets&lt;/H2&gt;
<span class="line-modified">178  * The {@code RowSet} interface works with various other classes and</span>
179  * interfaces behind the scenes. These can be grouped into three categories.
180  * &lt;OL&gt;
181  * &lt;LI&gt;Event Notification
182  * &lt;UL&gt;
<span class="line-modified">183  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code RowSetListener}&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">184  * A {@code RowSet} object is a JavaBeans&amp;trade;</span>
185  * component because it has properties and participates in the JavaBeans
<span class="line-modified">186  * event notification mechanism. The {@code RowSetListener} interface</span>
187  * is implemented by a component that wants to be notified about events that
<span class="line-modified">188  * occur to a particular {@code RowSet} object.  Such a component registers</span>
<span class="line-modified">189  * itself as a listener with a rowset via the {@code RowSet.addRowSetListener}</span>
190  * method.
191  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">192  * When the {@code RowSet} object changes one of its rows, changes all of</span>
193  * it rows, or moves its cursor, it also notifies each listener that is registered
194  * with it.  The listener reacts by carrying out its implementation of the
195  * notification method called on it.
<span class="line-modified">196  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code RowSetEvent}&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">197  * As part of its internal notification process, a {@code RowSet} object</span>
<span class="line-modified">198  * creates an instance of {@code RowSetEvent} and passes it to the listener.</span>
<span class="line-modified">199  * The listener can use this {@code RowSetEvent} object to find out which rowset</span>
200  * had the event.
201  * &lt;/UL&gt;
202  * &lt;LI&gt;Metadata
203  * &lt;UL&gt;
<span class="line-modified">204  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code RowSetMetaData}&lt;br&gt;</span>
205  * This interface, derived from the
<span class="line-modified">206  * {@code ResultSetMetaData} interface, provides information about</span>
<span class="line-modified">207  * the columns in a {@code RowSet} object.  An application can use</span>
<span class="line-modified">208  * {@code RowSetMetaData} methods to find out how many columns the</span>
209  * rowset contains and what kind of data each column can contain.
210  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">211  * The {@code RowSetMetaData} interface provides methods for</span>
212  * setting the information about columns, but an application would not
<span class="line-modified">213  * normally use these methods.  When an application calls the {@code RowSet}</span>
<span class="line-modified">214  * method {@code execute}, the {@code RowSet} object will contain</span>
<span class="line-modified">215  * a new set of rows, and its {@code RowSetMetaData} object will have been</span>
216  * internally updated to contain information about the new columns.
217  * &lt;/UL&gt;
218  * &lt;LI&gt;The Reader/Writer Facility&lt;br&gt;
<span class="line-modified">219  * A {@code RowSet} object that implements the {@code RowSetInternal}</span>
<span class="line-modified">220  * interface can call on the {@code RowSetReader} object associated with it</span>
<span class="line-modified">221  * to populate itself with data.  It can also call on the {@code RowSetWriter}</span>
222  * object associated with it to write any changes to its rows back to the
223  * data source from which it originally got the rows.
224  * A rowset that remains connected to its data source does not need to use a
225  * reader and writer because it can simply operate on the data source directly.
226  *
227  * &lt;UL&gt;
<span class="line-modified">228  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code RowSetInternal}&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">229  * By implementing the {@code RowSetInternal} interface, a</span>
<span class="line-modified">230  * {@code RowSet} object gets access to</span>
231  * its internal state and is able to call on its reader and writer. A rowset
232  * keeps track of the values in its current rows and of the values that immediately
233  * preceded the current ones, referred to as the &lt;i&gt;original&lt;/i&gt; values.  A rowset
234  * also keeps track of (1) the parameters that have been set for its command and
235  * (2) the connection that was passed to it, if any.  A rowset uses the
<span class="line-modified">236  * {@code RowSetInternal} methods behind the scenes to get access to</span>
237  * this information.  An application does not normally invoke these methods directly.
238  *
<span class="line-modified">239  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code RowSetReader}&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">240  * A disconnected {@code RowSet} object that has implemented the</span>
<span class="line-modified">241  * {@code RowSetInternal} interface can call on its reader (the</span>
<span class="line-modified">242  * {@code RowSetReader} object associated with it) to populate it with</span>
<span class="line-modified">243  * data.  When an application calls the {@code RowSet.execute} method,</span>
244  * that method calls on the rowset&#39;s reader to do much of the work. Implementations
245  * can vary widely, but generally a reader makes a connection to the data source,
246  * reads data from the data source and populates the rowset with it, and closes
<span class="line-modified">247  * the connection. A reader may also update the {@code RowSetMetaData} object</span>
248  * for its rowset.  The rowset&#39;s internal state is also updated, either by the
<span class="line-modified">249  * reader or directly by the method {@code RowSet.execute}.</span>
250  *
251  *
<span class="line-modified">252  * &lt;LI&gt;{@code RowSetWriter}&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">253  * A disconnected {@code RowSet} object that has implemented the</span>
<span class="line-modified">254  * {@code RowSetInternal} interface can call on its writer (the</span>
<span class="line-modified">255  * {@code RowSetWriter} object associated with it) to write changes</span>
256  * back to the underlying data source.  Implementations may vary widely, but
257  * generally, a writer will do the following:
258  *
259  * &lt;UL&gt;
260  * &lt;LI&gt;Make a connection to the data source
261  * &lt;LI&gt;Check to see whether there is a conflict, that is, whether
262  * a value that has been changed in the rowset has also been changed
263  * in the data source
264  * &lt;LI&gt;Write the new values to the data source if there is no conflict
265  * &lt;LI&gt;Close the connection
266  * &lt;/UL&gt;
267  *
268  *
269  * &lt;/UL&gt;
270  * &lt;/OL&gt;
271  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">272  * The {@code RowSet} interface may be implemented in any number of</span>
273  * ways, and anyone may write an implementation. Developers are encouraged
274  * to use their imaginations in coming up with new ways to use rowsets.
