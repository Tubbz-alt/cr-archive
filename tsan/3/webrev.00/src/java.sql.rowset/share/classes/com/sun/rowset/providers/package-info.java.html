 28  * Repository for the {@code RowSet} reference implementations of the
 29  * {@code SyncProvider} abstract class. These implementations provide a
 30  * disconnected {@code RowSet}
 31  * object with the ability to synchronize the data in the underlying data
 32  * source with its data.  These implementations are provided as
 33  * the default {@code SyncProvider} implementations and are accessible via the
 34  * {@code SyncProvider} SPI managed by the {@code SyncFactory}.
 35  *
 36  * &lt;h2&gt;1.0 {@code SyncProvider} Reference Implementations&lt;/h2&gt;
 37  *   The main job of a {@code SyncProvider} implementation is to manage
 38  * the reader and writer mechanisms.
 39  *  The {@code SyncProvider} SPI, as specified in the {@code javax.sql.rowset.spi}
 40  * package, provides a pluggable mechanism by which {@code javax.sql.RowSetReader}
 41  * and {@code javax.sql.RowSetWriter} implementations can be supplied to a disconnected
 42  * {@code RowSet} object.
 43  * &lt;P&gt;
 44  *  A reader, a {@code javax.sql.RowSetReader}
 45  * object, does the work necessary to populate a {@code RowSet} object with data.
 46  * A writer, a {@code javax.sql.RowSetWriter} object, does the work necessary for
 47  * synchronizing a {@code RowSet} object&#39;s data with the data in the originating
 48  * source of data. Put another way, a writer writes a {@code RowSet}
 49  * object&#39;s data back to the data source.
 50  * &lt;P&gt;
 51  * Generally speaking, the course of events is this.  The reader makes a connection to
 52  * the data source and reads the data from a {@code ResultSet} object into its
 53  * {@code RowSet} object.  Then it closes the connection.  While
 54  * the {@code RowSet} object is disconnected, an application makes some modifications
 55  * to the data and calls the method {@code acceptChanges}. At this point, the
 56  * writer is called to write the changes back to the database table or view
 57  * from which the original data came. This is called &lt;i&gt;synchronization&lt;/i&gt;.
 58  * &lt;P&gt;
 59  * If the data in the originating data source has not changed, there is no problem
 60  * with just writing the {@code RowSet} object&#39;s new data to the data source.
 61  * If it has changed, however, there is a conflict that needs to be resolved. One
 62  * way to solve the problem is not to let the data in the data source be changed in
 63  * the first place, which can be done by setting locks on a row, a table, or the
 64  * whole data source.  Setting locks is a way to avoid conflicts, but it can be
 65  * very expensive. Another approach, which is at the other end of the spectrum,
 66  *  is simply to assume that no conflicts will occur and thus do nothing to avoid
 67  * conflicts.
 68  * Different {@code SyncProvider} implementations may handle synchronization in
 69  * any of these ways, varying from doing no checking for
 70  * conflicts, to doing various levels of checking, to guaranteeing that there are no
 71  * conflicts.
 72  * &lt;P&gt;
 73  * The {@code SyncProvider} class offers methods to help a {@code RowSet}
 74  * object discover and manage how a provider handles synchronization.
 75  * The method {@code getProviderGrade} returns the
 76  * grade of synchronization a provider offers. An application can
 77  * direct the provider to use a particular level of locking by calling
 78  * the method {@code setDataSourceLock} and specifying the level of locking desired.
 79  * If a {@code RowSet} object&#39;s data came from an SQL {@code VIEW}, an
 80  * application may call the method {@code supportsUpdatableView} to
 81  * find out whether the {@code VIEW} can be updated.
 82  * &lt;P&gt;
 83  * Synchronization is done completely behind the scenes, so it is third party vendors of
 84  * synchronization provider implementations who have to take care of this complex task.
 85  * Application programmers can decide which provider to use and the level of locking to
 86  * be done, but they are free from having to worry about the implementation details.
 87  * &lt;P&gt;
 88  * The JDBC {@code RowSet} Implementations reference implementation provides two
 89  * implementations of the {@code SyncProvider} class:
 90  *
 91  * &lt;UL&gt;
 92  * &lt;LI&gt;
 93  * &lt;b&gt;{@code RIOptimisticProvider}&lt;/b&gt; - provides the {@code javax.sql.RowSetReader}
 94  * and {@code javax.sql.RowSetWriter} interface implementations and provides
 95  * an optimistic concurrency model for synchronization. This model assumes that there
 96  * will be few conflicts and therefore uses a relatively low grade of synchronization.
 97  * If no other provider is available, this is the default provider that the
 98  * {@code SyncFactory} will supply to a {@code RowSet} object.
 99  *     &lt;br&gt;
100  * &lt;LI&gt;
101  * &lt;b&gt;{@code RIXMLProvider}&lt;/b&gt; - provides the {@code XmlReader} (an extension
102  * of the {@code javax.sql.RowSetReader} interface) and the {@code XmlWriter}
103  * (an extension of the {@code javax.sql.RowSetWriter} interface) to enable
104  * {@code WebRowSet} objects to write their state to a
105  * well formed XML document according to the {@code WebRowSet} XML schema
106  * definition.&lt;br&gt;
107  * &lt;/UL&gt;
108  *
109  * &lt;h2&gt;2.0 Basics in RowSet Population &amp;amp; Synchronization&lt;/h2&gt;
110  * A rowset&#39;s first task is to populate itself with rows of column values.
111  * Generally,   these rows will come from a relational database, so a rowset
112  * has properties   that supply what is necessary for making a connection to
113  * a database and executing  a query. A rowset that does not need to establish
114  * a connection and execute  a command, such as one that gets its data from
115  * a tabular file instead of a relational database, does not need to have these
116  * properties set. The vast  majority of RowSets, however, do need to set these
117  * properties. The general  rule is that a RowSet is required to set only the
118  * properties that it uses.&lt;br&gt;
119  *     &lt;br&gt;
120  * The {@code command} property contains the query that determines what
121  * data  a {@code RowSet} will contain. Rowsets have methods for setting a query&#39;s
122  * parameter(s),  which means that a query can be executed multiple times with
123  * different parameters  to produce different result sets. Or the query can be
124  * changed to something  completely new to get a new result set.
125  * &lt;p&gt;Once a rowset contains the rows from a {@code ResultSet} object or some
126  * other data source, its column values can be updated, and its rows can be
127  * inserted or deleted. Any method that causes a change in the rowset&#39;s values
128  * or cursor position also notifies any object that has been registered as
129  * a listener with the rowset. So, for example, a table that displays the rowset&#39;s
130  * data in an applet can be notified of changes and make updates as they
131  * occur.&lt;br&gt;
132  *     &lt;br&gt;
133  * The changes made to a rowset can be propagated back to the original data
134  * source to keep the rowset and its data source synchronized. Although this
135  * involves many operations behind the scenes, it is completely transparent
136  * to the application programmer and remains the concern of the RowSet provider
137  * developer. All an application has to do is invoke the method {@code acceptChanges},
138  * and the data source backing the rowset will be updated to match the current
139  * values in the rowset. &lt;/p&gt;
140  *
141  * &lt;p&gt;A disconnected rowset, such as a {@code CachedRowSet} or {@code WebRowSet}
142  *  object, establishes a connection to populate itself with data from a database
143  *  and then closes the connection. The {@code RowSet} object will remain
144  *  disconnected until it wants to propagate changes back to its database table,
145  *  which is optional. To write its changes back to the database (synchronize with
146  *  the database), the rowset establishes a connection, write the changes, and then
147  *  once again disconnects itself.&lt;br&gt;
148  *   &lt;/p&gt;
149  *
150  * &lt;h2&gt; 3.0 Other Possible Implementations&lt;/h2&gt;
151  *  There are many other possible implementations of the {@code SyncProvider} abstract
152  *  class. One possibility is to employ a more robust synchronization model, which
153  *  would give a {@code RowSet} object increased trust in the provider&#39;s
154  *  ability to get any updates back to the original data source. Another possibility
155  *  is a more formal synchronization mechanism such as SyncML
156  *  (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syncml.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.syncml.org/&lt;/a&gt;)   &lt;br&gt;
