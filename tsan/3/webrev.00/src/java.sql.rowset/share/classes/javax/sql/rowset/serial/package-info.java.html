 26 /**
 27  * Provides utility classes to allow serializable mappings between SQL types
 28  * and data types in the Java programming language.
 29  * &lt;p&gt; Standard JDBC {@code RowSet} implementations may use these utility
 30  * classes to
 31  * assist in the serialization of disconnected {@code RowSet} objects.
 32  * This is useful
 33  * when  transmitting a disconnected {@code RowSet} object over the wire to
 34  * a different VM or across layers within an application.&lt;br&gt;
 35  * &lt;/p&gt;
 36  *
 37  * &lt;h2&gt;1.0 SerialArray&lt;/h2&gt;
 38  * A serializable mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL ARRAY
 39  * value. &lt;br&gt;
 40  * &lt;br&gt;
 41  * The {@code SerialArray} class provides a constructor for creating a {@code SerialArray}
 42  * instance from an Array object, methods for getting the base type and
 43  * the SQL name for the base type, and methods for copying all or part of a
 44  * {@code SerialArray} object. &lt;br&gt;
 45  *
 46  * &lt;h2&gt;2.0 SerialBlob&lt;/h2&gt;
 47  * A serializable mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL BLOB
 48  * value.  &lt;br&gt;
 49  * &lt;br&gt;
 50  * The {@code SerialBlob} class provides a constructor for creating an instance
 51  * from a Blob object. Note that the Blob object should have brought the SQL
 52  * BLOB value&#39;s data over to the client before a {@code SerialBlob} object
 53  * is constructed from it. The data of an SQL BLOB value can be materialized
 54  * on the client as an array of bytes (using the method {@code Blob.getBytes})
 55  * or as a stream of uninterpreted bytes (using the method {@code Blob.getBinaryStream}).
 56  * &lt;br&gt;
 57  * &lt;br&gt;
 58  * {@code SerialBlob} methods make it possible to make a copy of a {@code SerialBlob}
 59  * object as an array of bytes or as a stream. They also make it possible
 60  * to locate a given pattern of bytes or a {@code Blob} object within a {@code SerialBlob}
 61  * object. &lt;br&gt;
 62  *
 63  * &lt;h2&gt;3.0 SerialClob&lt;/h2&gt;
 64  * A serializable mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL CLOB
 65  * value.  &lt;br&gt;
 66  * &lt;br&gt;
 67  * The {@code SerialClob} class provides a constructor for creating an instance
 68  * from a {@code Clob} object. Note that the {@code Clob} object should have
 69  * brought the SQL CLOB value&#39;s data over to the client before a {@code SerialClob}
 70  * object is constructed from it. The data of an SQL CLOB value can be
 71  * materialized on the client as a stream of Unicode characters. &lt;br&gt;
 72  * &lt;br&gt;
 73  * {@code SerialClob} methods make it possible to get a substring from a
 74  * {@code SerialClob} object or to locate the start of a pattern of characters.
 75  * &lt;br&gt;
 76  *
 77  * &lt;h2&gt;5.0 SerialDatalink&lt;/h2&gt;
 78  * A serializable mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL DATALINK
 79  * value. A DATALINK value references a file outside of the underlying data source
 80  * that the originating data source manages. &lt;br&gt;
 81  * &lt;br&gt;
 82  * {@code RowSet} implementations can use the method {@code RowSet.getURL()} to retrieve
 83  * a {@code java.net.URL} object, which can be used to manipulate the external data.
 84  * &lt;br&gt;
 85  * &lt;PRE&gt;
 86  *    java.net.URL url = rowset.getURL(1);
 87  * &lt;/PRE&gt;
 88  *
 89  * &lt;h2&gt;6.0 SerialJavaObject&lt;/h2&gt;
 90  * A serializable mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL JAVA_OBJECT
 91  * value. Assuming the Java object instance implements the Serializable interface,
 92  * this simply wraps the serialization process. &lt;br&gt;
 93  * &lt;br&gt;
 94  * If however, the serialization is not possible in the case where the Java
 95  * object is not immediately serializable, this class will attempt to serialize
 96  * all non static members to permit the object instance state to be serialized.
 97  * Static or transient fields cannot be serialized and attempting to do so
 98  * will result in a {@code SerialException} being thrown. &lt;br&gt;
 99  *
100  * &lt;h2&gt;7.0 SerialRef&lt;/h2&gt;
101  * A serializable mapping between the SQL REF type and the Java programming
102  * language. &lt;br&gt;
103  * &lt;br&gt;
104  * The {@code SerialRef} class provides a constructor for creating a {@code SerialRef}
105  * instance from a {@code Ref} type and provides methods for getting
106  * and setting the {@code Ref} object type. &lt;br&gt;
107  *
108  * &lt;h2&gt;8.0 SerialStruct&lt;/h2&gt;
109  * A serializable mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL structured
110  * type. Each attribute that is not already serializable is mapped to a serializable
111  * form, and if an attribute is itself a structured type, each of its attributes
112  * that is not already serializable is mapped to a serializable form. &lt;br&gt;
113  * &lt;br&gt;
114  * In addition, if a {@code Map} object is passed to one of the constructors or
115  * to the method {@code getAttributes}, the structured type is custom mapped
116  * according to the mapping specified in the {@code Map} object.
117  * &lt;br&gt;
118  * The {@code SerialStruct} class provides a constructor for creating an
119  * instance  from a {@code Struct} object, a method for retrieving the SQL
120  * type name of the SQL structured type in the database, and methods for retrieving
121  * its attribute values. &lt;br&gt;
122  *
123  * &lt;h2&gt;9.0 SQLInputImpl&lt;/h2&gt;
124  *   An input stream used for custom mapping user-defined types (UDTs). An
125  *   {@code SQLInputImpl} object is an input stream that contains a stream of
126  *   values that are
127  * the attributes of a UDT. This class is used by the driver behind the scenes
128  * when the method {@code getObject} is called on an SQL structured or distinct
129  * type that has a custom mapping; a programmer never invokes {@code SQLInputImpl}
130  * methods directly. &lt;br&gt;
131  *   &lt;br&gt;
132  * The {@code SQLInputImpl} class provides a set of reader methods
133  * analogous to the {@code ResultSet} getter methods. These methods make it
134  * possible to read the values in an {@code SQLInputImpl} object. The method
135  * {@code wasNull} is used to determine whether the last value read was SQL NULL.
136  * &lt;br&gt;
137  *  &lt;br&gt;
138  * When a constructor or getter method that takes a {@code Map} object is called,
139  * the JDBC driver calls the method
140  * {@code SQLData.getSQLType} to determine the SQL type of the UDT being custom
141  * mapped. The driver  creates an instance of {@code SQLInputImpl}, populating it with
142  * the attributes of  the UDT. The driver then passes the input stream to the
143  * method {@code SQLData.readSQL},  which in turn calls the {@code SQLInputImpl}
144  * methods to read the  attributes from the input stream. &lt;br&gt;
145  *
146  * &lt;h2&gt;10.0 SQLOutputImpl&lt;/h2&gt;
147  *   The output stream for writing the attributes of a custom mapped user-defined
148  *  type (UDT) back to the database. The driver uses this interface internally,
149  *  and its methods are never directly invoked by an application programmer.
150  * &lt;br&gt;
151  *   &lt;br&gt;
152  * When an application calls the method {@code PreparedStatement.setObject}, the
153  * driver checks to see whether the value to be written is a UDT with a custom
154  * mapping. If it is, there will be an entry in a type map containing the Class
155  * object for the class that implements {@code SQLData} for this UDT. If the
156  * value to be written is an instance of {@code SQLData}, the driver will
157  * create  an instance of {@code SQLOutputImpl} and pass it to the method
158  * {@code SQLData.writeSQL}.
159  * The method {@code writeSQL} in turn calls the appropriate {@code SQLOutputImpl}
160  * writer methods to write data from the {@code SQLData} object to the
161  * {@code SQLOutputImpl}
162  * output  stream as the representation of an SQL user-defined type.
163  *
164  * &lt;h2&gt;Custom Mapping&lt;/h2&gt;
165  * The JDBC API provides mechanisms for mapping an SQL structured type or DISTINCT
166  * type to the Java programming language.  Typically, a structured type is mapped
167  * to a class, and its attributes are mapped to fields in the class.
168  * (A DISTINCT type can thought of as having one attribute.)  However, there are
169  * many other possibilities, and there may be any number of different mappings.
170  * &lt;P&gt;
171  * A programmer defines the mapping by implementing the interface {@code SQLData}.
172  * For example, if an SQL structured type named AUTHORS has the attributes NAME,
173  * TITLE, and PUBLISHER, it could be mapped to a Java class named Authors.  The
174  * Authors class could have the fields name, title, and publisher, to which the
175  * attributes of AUTHORS are mapped.  In such a case, the implementation of
176  * {@code SQLData} could look like the following:
177  * &lt;PRE&gt;
178  *    public class Authors implements SQLData {
179  *        public String name;
180  *        public String title;
181  *        public String publisher;
182  *
183  *        private String sql_type;
184  *        public String getSQLTypeName() {
185  *            return sql_type;
186  *        }
187  *
188  *        public void readSQL(SQLInput stream, String type)
189  *                                   throws SQLException  {
190  *            sql_type = type;
191  *            name = stream.readString();
192  *            title = stream.readString();
193  *            publisher = stream.readString();
194  *        }
195  *
196  *        public void writeSQL(SQLOutput stream) throws SQLException {
197  *            stream.writeString(name);
198  *            stream.writeString(title);
199  *            stream.writeString(publisher);
200  *        }
201  *    }
202  * &lt;/PRE&gt;
203  *
204  * A {@code java.util.Map} object is used to associate the SQL structured
205  * type with its mapping to the class {@code Authors}. The following code fragment shows
206  * how a {@code Map} object might be created and given an entry associating
207  * {@code AUTHORS} and {@code Authors}.
208  * &lt;PRE&gt;
209  *     java.util.Map map = new java.util.HashMap();
210  *     map.put(&quot;SCHEMA_NAME.AUTHORS&quot;, Class.forName(&quot;Authors&quot;);
211  * &lt;/PRE&gt;
212  *
213  * The {@code Map} object &lt;i&gt;map&lt;/i&gt; now contains an entry with the
214  * fully qualified name of the SQL structured type and the {@code Class}
215  *  object for the class {@code Authors}.  It can be passed to a method
216  * to tell the driver how to map {@code AUTHORS} to {@code Authors}.
217  * &lt;P&gt;
218  * For a disconnected {@code RowSet} object, custom mapping can be done
219  * only when a {@code Map} object is passed to the method or constructor
220  * that will be doing the custom mapping.  The situation is different for
221  * connected {@code RowSet} objects because they maintain a connection
222  * with the data source.  A method that does custom mapping and is called by
223  * a disconnected {@code RowSet} object may use the {@code Map}
224  * object that is associated with the {@code Connection} object being
225  * used. So, in other words, if no map is specified, the connection&#39;s type
226  * map can be used by default.
