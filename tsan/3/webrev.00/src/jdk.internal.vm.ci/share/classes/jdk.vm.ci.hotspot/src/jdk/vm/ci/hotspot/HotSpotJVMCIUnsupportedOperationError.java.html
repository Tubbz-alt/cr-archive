29  * Indicates a path in HotSpot JVMCI related code that is unsupported in the current execution
30  * environment. For example, certain operations are not supported by JVMCI code running in an ahead
31  * of time compiled {@linkplain Services#IS_IN_NATIVE_IMAGE native image}. This usually reflects
32  * functionality only needed in non-native image execution that would require a more complex
33  * implementation to support in a native image.
34  *
35  * An example of such functionality is {@link ResolvedJavaType#isLocal()}. This can be conveniently
36  * implemented when JVMCI is running on the HotSpot heap as we can obtain the {@link Class} mirror
37  * for the {@link ResolvedJavaType} and call {@link Class#isLocalClass()}. In a native image, there
38  * is no {@link Class} mirror available in the native image heap so implementing this would involve
39  * a call into VM native code that in turn would make an upcall into Java code executing on the
40  * HotSpot heap. We have opted to defer implementing functionality such as this until there&#39;s a
41  * demonstrated need for it.
