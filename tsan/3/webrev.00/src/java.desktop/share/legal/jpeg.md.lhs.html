<span class="line-removed">48 ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,</span>
<span class="line-removed">49 sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.</span>
<span class="line-removed">50 ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead</span>
<span class="line-removed">51 by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,</span>
<span class="line-removed">52 that you must include source code if you redistribute it.</span>
<span class="line-removed">53 (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is</span>
<span class="line-removed">54 not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not</span>
<span class="line-removed">55 limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.</span>
<span class="line-removed">56 </span>
<span class="line-removed">57 The Unix configuration script &quot;configure&quot; was produced with GNU Autoconf.</span>
<span class="line-removed">58 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.</span>
<span class="line-removed">59 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,</span>
<span class="line-removed">60 ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright</span>
<span class="line-removed">61 by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.</span>
<span class="line-removed">62 </span>
63 It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered
64 by patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding
65 cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this
66 reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
67 JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain
68 over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
69 implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are
70 no patent restrictions on the remaining code.
71 
72 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
73 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support
74 has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
75 produce &quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;.  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm;
76 the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all
77 standard GIF decoders.
78 
79 We are required to state that &quot;The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is
80 the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a
81 Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.&quot;
