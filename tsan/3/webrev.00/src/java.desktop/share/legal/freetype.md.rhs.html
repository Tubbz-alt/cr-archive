  5 
  6 ```
  7 FreeType comes with two licenses from which you can choose the one
  8 which fits your needs best.
  9 
 10     The FreeType License (FTL) is the most commonly used one. It is
 11     a BSD-style license with a credit clause and thus compatible with
 12     the GNU Public License (GPL) version 3, but not with the
 13     GPL version 2.
 14 
 15     The GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. Use it for all
 16     projects which use the GPLv2 also, or which need a license
 17     compatible to the GPLv2.

 33 Introduction
 34 ============
 35 
 36   The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
 37   some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
 38   various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
 39   FreeType Project.
 40 
 41   This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
 42   which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
 43   affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
 44   documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
 45 
 46   This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
 47   (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
 48   and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
 49   alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
 50 
 51     o We don&#39;t promise that this software works. However, we will be
 52       interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is&#39; distribution)
 53 
 54     o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
 55       full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free&#39; usage)
 56 
 57     o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
 58       it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
 59       somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
 60       FreeType code. (`credits&#39;)
 61 
 62   We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
 63   software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
 64   We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
 65   assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
 66 
 67 
 68   Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
 69   credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
 70   encourage you to use the following text:
 71 
 72    &quot;&quot;&quot;
 73     Portions of this software are copyright Â© &lt;year&gt; The FreeType
 74     Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
 75    &quot;&quot;&quot;
 76 
 77   Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you
 78   actually use.

 81 Legal Terms
 82 ===========
 83 
 84 0. Definitions
 85 --------------
 86 
 87   Throughout this license,  the terms `package&#39;, `FreeType Project&#39;,
 88   and  `FreeType  archive&#39; refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
 89   distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
 90   Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project&#39;, be they named as alpha,
 91   beta or final release.
 92 
 93   `You&#39; refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
 94   `using&#39; is a generic term including compiling the project&#39;s source
 95   code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program&#39; or `executable&#39;.
 96   This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
 97   engine&#39;.
 98 
 99   This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
100   FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
101   documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
102   original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
103   If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
104   this license, you must contact us to verify this.
105 
106   The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
107   Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
108   specified below.
109 
110 1. No Warranty
111 --------------
112 
113   THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS&#39; WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
114   KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
115   WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
116   PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
117   BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
118   USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
119 
120 2. Redistribution
121 -----------------
122 
123   This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
124   irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
125   display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
126   sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
127   forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
128   authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
129   herein, subject to the following conditions:
130 
131     o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
132       (`FTL.TXT&#39;) unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
133       the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
134       documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
135       original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
136       files.
137 
138     o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
139       states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
140       FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
141       encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
142       documentation, though this isn&#39;t mandatory.
143 
144   These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
145   the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
146   our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
147   to us.
148 
149 3. Advertising
150 --------------
151 
152   Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
153   the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
154   purposes without specific prior written permission.
155 
156   We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
157   following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
158   or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project&#39;,  `FreeType Engine&#39;,
159   `FreeType library&#39;, or `FreeType Distribution&#39;.
160 
161   As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
162   accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
163   material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
164   authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
165   Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
166   Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
167   of this license.

192 ### GPL v2
193 
194 ```
195 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
196 		       Version 2, June 1991
197 
198  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
199      51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
200  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
201  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
202 
203 			    Preamble
204 
205   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
206 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
207 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
208 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
209 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
210 Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to
211 using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
212 the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
213 your programs, too.
214 
215   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
216 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
217 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
218 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
219 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
220 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
221 
222   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
223 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
224 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
225 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
226 
227   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
228 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
229 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
230 source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
231 rights.
232 
233   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
234 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
235 distribute and/or modify the software.
236 
237   Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
238 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
239 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
240 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
241 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
242 authors&#39; reputations.
243 
244   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
245 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
246 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
247 program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
248 patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.
249 
250   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
251 modification follow.
252 
253 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
254    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
255 
256   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
257 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
258 under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
259 refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
260 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
261 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
262 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
263 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
264 the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
265 
266 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
267 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
268 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
269 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
270 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
271 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
272 
273   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s
274 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
275 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
276 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
277 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
278 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
279 along with the Program.
280 
281 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
282 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
283 
284   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
285 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
286 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
287 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
288 
289     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
290     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
291 
292     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
293     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
294     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
295     parties under the terms of this License.
296 
297     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
298     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
299     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
300     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
301     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
302     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
303     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
304     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
305     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
306     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
307 
308 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
309 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
310 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
311 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
312 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
313 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
314 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
315 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
316 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
317 
318 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
319 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
320 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
321 collective works based on the Program.
322 
323 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
324 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
325 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
326 the scope of this License.
327 
328   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
329 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
330 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
331 
332     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
333     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
334     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
335 
336     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
337     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
338     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
339     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
340     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
341     customarily used for software interchange; or,
342 
343     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
344     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
345     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
346     received the program in object code or executable form with such
347     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
348 
349 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
350 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
351 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
352 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
353 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
354 special exception, the source code distributed need not include
355 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
356 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
357 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
358 itself accompanies the executable.
359 
360 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
361 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
362 access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
363 distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
364 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
365 
366   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
367 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
368 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
369 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
370 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
371 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
372 parties remain in full compliance.
373 
374   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
375 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
376 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
377 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
378 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
379 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
380 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
381 the Program or works based on it.
382 
383   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
384 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
385 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
386 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
387 restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
388 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
389 this License.
390 
391   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
392 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
393 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
394 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
395 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
396 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
397 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
398 may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
399 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
400 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
401 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
402 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
403 
404 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
405 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
406 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
407 circumstances.
408 
409 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
410 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
411 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
412 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
413 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
414 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
415 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
416 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
417 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
418 impose that choice.
419 
420 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
421 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
422 
423   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
424 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
425 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
426 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
427 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
428 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
429 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
430 
431   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
432 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
433 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
434 address new problems or concerns.
435 
436 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
437 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
438 later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
439 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
440 Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
441 this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
442 Foundation.
443 
444   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
445 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
446 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
447 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
448 make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
449 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
450 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
451 
452 			    NO WARRANTY
453 
454   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
455 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
456 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
457 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
458 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
459 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
460 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
461 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,

476 	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
477 
478   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
479 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
480 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
481 
482   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
483 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
484 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
485 the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
486 
487     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
488     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
489 
490     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
491     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
492     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
493     (at your option) any later version.
494 
495     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
496     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
497     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
498     GNU General Public License for more details.
499 
500     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
501     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
502     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
503 
504 
505 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
506 
507 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
508 when it starts in an interactive mode:
509 
510     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
511     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
512     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
513     under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.
514 
515 The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate
516 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
517 be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be
518 mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
519 
520 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
521 school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
522 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
523 
524   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
525   `Gnomovision&#39; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
526 
527   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
528   Ty Coon, President of Vice
529 
530 This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
531 proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
532 consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
533 library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
534 Public License instead of this License.
