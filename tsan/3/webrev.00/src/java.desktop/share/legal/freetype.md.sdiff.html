  5 
  6 ```
  7 FreeType comes with two licenses from which you can choose the one
  8 which fits your needs best.
  9 
 10     The FreeType License (FTL) is the most commonly used one. It is
 11     a BSD-style license with a credit clause and thus compatible with
 12     the GNU Public License (GPL) version 3, but not with the
 13     GPL version 2.
 14 
 15     The GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. Use it for all
 16     projects which use the GPLv2 also, or which need a license
 17     compatible to the GPLv2.
 18 
 19 ```
 20 
 21 ### FreeType License
</pre>
<hr />
<pre>
516 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
517 be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be
518 mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
519 
520 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
521 school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
522 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
523 
524   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
525   `Gnomovision&#39; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
526 
527   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
528   Ty Coon, President of Vice
529 
530 This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
531 proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
532 consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
533 library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
534 Public License instead of this License.
