18 this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee,
19 subject to these conditions:
20 
21 (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed,
22 then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty
23 notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original
24 files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
25 
26 (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation
27 must state that &quot;this software is based in part on the work of the
28 Independent JPEG Group&quot;.
29 
30 (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
31 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
32 NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
33 
34 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
35 not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
36 acknowledge us.
37 
38 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author&#39;s name or company name
39 in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived
40 from it.  This software may be referred to only as &quot;the Independent JPEG
41 Group&#39;s software&quot;.

43 We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis
44 of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
45 assumed by the product vendor.

<span class="line-removed">48 ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,</span>
<span class="line-removed">49 sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.</span>
<span class="line-removed">50 ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead</span>
<span class="line-removed">51 by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,</span>
<span class="line-removed">52 that you must include source code if you redistribute it.</span>
<span class="line-removed">53 (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is</span>
<span class="line-removed">54 not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not</span>
<span class="line-removed">55 limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.</span>
<span class="line-removed">56 </span>
<span class="line-removed">57 The Unix configuration script &quot;configure&quot; was produced with GNU Autoconf.</span>
<span class="line-removed">58 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.</span>
<span class="line-removed">59 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,</span>
<span class="line-removed">60 ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright</span>
<span class="line-removed">61 by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.</span>
<span class="line-removed">62 </span>
63 It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered
64 by patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding
65 cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this
66 reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
67 JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain
68 over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
69 implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are
70 no patent restrictions on the remaining code.
71 
72 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
73 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support
74 has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
75 produce &quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;.  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm;
76 the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all
77 standard GIF decoders.
78 
79 We are required to state that &quot;The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is
80 the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a
81 Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.&quot;
