55 It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered
56 by patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding
57 cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this
58 reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
59 JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain
60 over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
61 implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are
62 no patent restrictions on the remaining code.
63 
64 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
65 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support
66 has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
67 produce &quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;.  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm;
68 the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all
69 standard GIF decoders.
70 
71 We are required to state that &quot;The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is
72 the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a
73 Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.&quot;
