  1 README for libpng version 1.6.35 - July 15, 2018 (shared library 16.0)
  2 See the note about version numbers near the top of png.h
  3 
  4 See INSTALL for instructions on how to install libpng.
  5 
  6 Libpng comes in several distribution formats.  Get libpng-*.tar.gz or
  7 libpng-*.tar.xz or if you want UNIX-style line endings in the text files,
  8 or lpng*.7z or lpng*.zip if you want DOS-style line endings.
  9 
 10 Version 0.89 was the first official release of libpng.  Don&#39;t let the
 11 fact that it&#39;s the first release fool you.  The libpng library has been in
 12 extensive use and testing since mid-1995.  By late 1997 it had
 13 finally gotten to the stage where there hadn&#39;t been significant
 14 changes to the API in some time, and people have a bad feeling about
 15 libraries with versions &lt; 1.0.  Version 1.0.0 was released in
 16 March 1998.
 17 
 18 ****
 19 Note that some of the changes to the png_info structure render this
 20 version of the library binary incompatible with libpng-0.89 or
 21 earlier versions if you are using a shared library.  The type of the
 22 &quot;filler&quot; parameter for png_set_filler() has changed from png_byte to
 23 png_uint_32, which will affect shared-library applications that use
 24 this function.
 25 
 26 To avoid problems with changes to the internals of the png info_struct,
 27 new APIs have been made available in 0.95 to avoid direct application
 28 access to info_ptr.  These functions are the png_set_&lt;chunk&gt; and
 29 png_get_&lt;chunk&gt; functions.  These functions should be used when
 30 accessing/storing the info_struct data, rather than manipulating it
 31 directly, to avoid such problems in the future.
 32 
 33 It is important to note that the APIs did not make current programs
 34 that access the info struct directly incompatible with the new
 35 library, through libpng-1.2.x.  In libpng-1.4.x, which was meant to
 36 be a transitional release, members of the png_struct and the
 37 info_struct can still be accessed, but the compiler will issue a
 38 warning about deprecated usage.  Since libpng-1.5.0, direct access
 39 to these structs is not allowed, and the definitions of the structs
 40 reside in private pngstruct.h and pnginfo.h header files that are not
 41 accessible to applications.  It is strongly suggested that new
 42 programs use the new APIs (as shown in example.c and pngtest.c), and
 43 older programs be converted to the new format, to facilitate upgrades
 44 in the future.
 45 ****
 46 
 47 Additions since 0.90 include the ability to compile libpng as a
 48 Windows DLL, and new APIs for accessing data in the info struct.
 49 Experimental functions include the ability to set weighting and cost
 50 factors for row filter selection, direct reads of integers from buffers
 51 on big-endian processors that support misaligned data access, faster
 52 methods of doing alpha composition, and more accurate 16-&gt;8 bit color
 53 conversion.
 54 
 55 The additions since 0.89 include the ability to read from a PNG stream
 56 which has had some (or all) of the signature bytes read by the calling
 57 application.  This also allows the reading of embedded PNG streams that
 58 do not have the PNG file signature.  As well, it is now possible to set
 59 the library action on the detection of chunk CRC errors.  It is possible
 60 to set different actions based on whether the CRC error occurred in a
 61 critical or an ancillary chunk.
 62 
 63 The changes made to the library, and bugs fixed are based on discussions
 64 on the PNG-implement mailing list and not on material submitted
 65 privately to Guy, Andreas, or Glenn.  They will forward any good
 66 suggestions to the list.
 67 
 68 For a detailed description on using libpng, read libpng-manual.txt.  For
 69 examples of libpng in a program, see example.c and pngtest.c.  For usage
 70 information and restrictions (what little they are) on libpng, see
 71 png.h.  For a description on using zlib (the compression library used by
 72 libpng) and zlib&#39;s restrictions, see zlib.h
 73 
 74 I have included a general makefile, as well as several machine and
 75 compiler specific ones, but you may have to modify one for your own needs.
 76 
 77 You should use zlib 1.0.4 or later to run this, but it MAY work with
 78 versions as old as zlib 0.95.  Even so, there are bugs in older zlib
 79 versions which can cause the output of invalid compression streams for
 80 some images.  You will definitely need zlib 1.0.4 or later if you are
 81 taking advantage of the MS-DOS &quot;far&quot; structure allocation for the small
 82 and medium memory models.  You should also note that zlib is a
 83 compression library that is useful for more things than just PNG files.
 84 You can use zlib as a drop-in replacement for fread() and fwrite() if
 85 you are so inclined.
 86 
 87 zlib should be available at the same place that libpng is, or at zlib.net.
 88 
 89 You may also want a copy of the PNG specification.  It is available
 90 as an RFC, a W3C Recommendation, and an ISO/IEC Standard.  You can find
 91 these at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngdocs.html .
 92 
 93 This code is currently being archived at libpng.sourceforge.io in the
 94 [DOWNLOAD] area, and at http://libpng.download/src .  If you
 95 can&#39;t find it in any of those places, e-mail me, and I&#39;ll help you find it.
 96 
 97 I am not a lawyer, but I believe that the Export Control Classification
 98 Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export
 99 controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because it
100 is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain any
101 encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and 734.7(b).
102 
103 If you have any code changes, requests, problems, etc., please e-mail
104 them to me.  Also, I&#39;d appreciate any make files or project files,
105 and any modifications you needed to make to get libpng to compile,
106 along with a #define variable to tell what compiler/system you are on.
107 If you needed to add transformations to libpng, or wish libpng would
108 provide the image in a different way, drop me a note (and code, if
109 possible), so I can consider supporting the transformation.
110 Finally, if you get any warning messages when compiling libpng
111 (note: not zlib), and they are easy to fix, I&#39;d appreciate the
112 fix.  Please mention &quot;libpng&quot; somewhere in the subject line.  Thanks.
113 
114 This release was created and will be supported by myself (of course
115 based in a large way on Guy&#39;s and Andreas&#39; earlier work), and the PNG
116 development group.

123 You can&#39;t reach Guy, the original libpng author, at the addresses
124 given in previous versions of this document.  He and Andreas will
125 read mail addressed to the png-implement list, however.
126 
127 Please do not send general questions about PNG.  Send them to
128 png-mng-misc at lists.sf.net (subscription required; visit
129 https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/png-mng-misc to
130 subscribe).  If you have a question about something
131 in the PNG specification that is related to using libpng, send it
132 to me.  Send me any questions that start with &quot;I was using libpng,
133 and ...&quot;.  If in doubt, send questions to me.  I&#39;ll bounce them
134 to others, if necessary.
135 
136 Please do not send suggestions on how to change PNG.  We have
137 been discussing PNG for twenty years now, and it is official and
138 finished.  If you have suggestions for libpng, however, I&#39;ll
139 gladly listen.  Even if your suggestion is not used immediately,
140 it may be used later.
