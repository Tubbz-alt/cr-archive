<span class="line-removed">-  * Y2K compliance in libpng:</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  * =========================</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    July 15, 2018</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    Since the PNG Development group is an ad-hoc body, we can&#39;t make</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    an official declaration.</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    This is your unofficial assurance that libpng from version 0.71 and</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    upward through 1.6.35 are Y2K compliant.  It is my belief that</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    earlier versions were also Y2K compliant.</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    Libpng only has two year fields.  One is a 2-byte unsigned integer</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    that will hold years up to 65535.  The other, which is deprecated,</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    holds the date in text format, and will hold years up to 9999.</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    The integer is</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *        &quot;png_uint_16 year&quot; in png_time_struct.</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    The string is</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *        &quot;char time_buffer[29]&quot; in png_struct.  This is no longer used</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    in libpng-1.6.x and will be removed from libpng-1.7.0.</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    There are seven time-related functions:</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *        png.c: png_convert_to_rfc_1123_buffer() in png.c</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *          (formerly png_convert_to_rfc_1123() prior to libpng-1.5.x and</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *          png_convert_to_rfc_1152() in error prior to libpng-0.98)</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *        png_convert_from_struct_tm() in pngwrite.c, called in pngwrite.c</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *        png_convert_from_time_t() in pngwrite.c</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *        png_get_tIME() in pngget.c</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *        png_handle_tIME() in pngrutil.c, called in pngread.c</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *        png_set_tIME() in pngset.c</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *        png_write_tIME() in pngwutil.c, called in pngwrite.c</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    All handle dates properly in a Y2K environment.  The</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    png_convert_from_time_t() function calls gmtime() to convert from system</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    clock time, which returns (year - 1900), which we properly convert to</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    the full 4-digit year.  There is a possibility that libpng applications</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    are not passing 4-digit years into the png_convert_to_rfc_1123_buffer()</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    function, or that they are incorrectly passing only a 2-digit year</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    instead of &quot;year - 1900&quot; into the png_convert_from_struct_tm() function,</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    but this is not under our control.  The libpng documentation has always</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    stated that it works with 4-digit years, and the APIs have been</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    documented as such.</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    The tIME chunk itself is also Y2K compliant.  It uses a 2-byte unsigned</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    integer to hold the year, and can hold years as large as 65535.</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    zlib, upon which libpng depends, is also Y2K compliant.  It contains</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *    no date-related code.</span>
