<span class="line-modified">! README for libpng version 1.6.35 - July 15, 2018 (shared library 16.0)</span>
<span class="line-modified">! See the note about version numbers near the top of png.h</span>
  
  See INSTALL for instructions on how to install libpng.
  
  Libpng comes in several distribution formats.  Get libpng-*.tar.gz or
<span class="line-modified">! libpng-*.tar.xz or if you want UNIX-style line endings in the text files,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! or lpng*.7z or lpng*.zip if you want DOS-style line endings.</span>
  
  Version 0.89 was the first official release of libpng.  Don&#39;t let the
<span class="line-modified">! fact that it&#39;s the first release fool you.  The libpng library has been in</span>
<span class="line-modified">! extensive use and testing since mid-1995.  By late 1997 it had</span>
  finally gotten to the stage where there hadn&#39;t been significant
  changes to the API in some time, and people have a bad feeling about
  libraries with versions &lt; 1.0.  Version 1.0.0 was released in
  March 1998.

  do not have the PNG file signature.  As well, it is now possible to set
  the library action on the detection of chunk CRC errors.  It is possible
  to set different actions based on whether the CRC error occurred in a
  critical or an ancillary chunk.
  
<span class="line-modified">! The changes made to the library, and bugs fixed are based on discussions</span>
<span class="line-modified">! on the PNG-implement mailing list and not on material submitted</span>
<span class="line-modified">! privately to Guy, Andreas, or Glenn.  They will forward any good</span>
<span class="line-modified">! suggestions to the list.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-removed">- For a detailed description on using libpng, read libpng-manual.txt.  For</span>
<span class="line-removed">- examples of libpng in a program, see example.c and pngtest.c.  For usage</span>
<span class="line-removed">- information and restrictions (what little they are) on libpng, see</span>
<span class="line-removed">- png.h.  For a description on using zlib (the compression library used by</span>
<span class="line-removed">- libpng) and zlib&#39;s restrictions, see zlib.h</span>
  
  I have included a general makefile, as well as several machine and
<span class="line-modified">! compiler specific ones, but you may have to modify one for your own needs.</span>
  
  You should use zlib 1.0.4 or later to run this, but it MAY work with
  versions as old as zlib 0.95.  Even so, there are bugs in older zlib
  versions which can cause the output of invalid compression streams for
<span class="line-modified">! some images.  You will definitely need zlib 1.0.4 or later if you are</span>
<span class="line-modified">! taking advantage of the MS-DOS &quot;far&quot; structure allocation for the small</span>
<span class="line-modified">! and medium memory models.  You should also note that zlib is a</span>
<span class="line-modified">! compression library that is useful for more things than just PNG files.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! You can use zlib as a drop-in replacement for fread() and fwrite() if</span>
<span class="line-removed">- you are so inclined.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">! zlib should be available at the same place that libpng is, or at zlib.net.</span>
  
  You may also want a copy of the PNG specification.  It is available
  as an RFC, a W3C Recommendation, and an ISO/IEC Standard.  You can find
  these at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngdocs.html .
  
  This code is currently being archived at libpng.sourceforge.io in the
<span class="line-modified">! [DOWNLOAD] area, and at http://libpng.download/src .  If you</span>
<span class="line-modified">! can&#39;t find it in any of those places, e-mail me, and I&#39;ll help you find it.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">! I am not a lawyer, but I believe that the Export Control Classification</span>
<span class="line-removed">- Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export</span>
<span class="line-removed">- controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because it</span>
<span class="line-removed">- is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain any</span>
<span class="line-removed">- encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and 734.7(b).</span>
<span class="line-removed">- </span>
<span class="line-removed">- If you have any code changes, requests, problems, etc., please e-mail</span>
<span class="line-removed">- them to me.  Also, I&#39;d appreciate any make files or project files,</span>
<span class="line-removed">- and any modifications you needed to make to get libpng to compile,</span>
<span class="line-removed">- along with a #define variable to tell what compiler/system you are on.</span>
<span class="line-removed">- If you needed to add transformations to libpng, or wish libpng would</span>
<span class="line-removed">- provide the image in a different way, drop me a note (and code, if</span>
<span class="line-removed">- possible), so I can consider supporting the transformation.</span>
<span class="line-removed">- Finally, if you get any warning messages when compiling libpng</span>
<span class="line-removed">- (note: not zlib), and they are easy to fix, I&#39;d appreciate the</span>
<span class="line-removed">- fix.  Please mention &quot;libpng&quot; somewhere in the subject line.  Thanks.</span>
<span class="line-removed">- </span>
<span class="line-removed">- This release was created and will be supported by myself (of course</span>
<span class="line-removed">- based in a large way on Guy&#39;s and Andreas&#39; earlier work), and the PNG</span>
  development group.
