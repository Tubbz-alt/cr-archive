- * Y2K compliance in libpng:
- * =========================
- *
- *    July 15, 2018
- *
- *    Since the PNG Development group is an ad-hoc body, we can't make
- *    an official declaration.
- *
- *    This is your unofficial assurance that libpng from version 0.71 and
- *    upward through 1.6.35 are Y2K compliant.  It is my belief that
- *    earlier versions were also Y2K compliant.
- *
- *    Libpng only has two year fields.  One is a 2-byte unsigned integer
- *    that will hold years up to 65535.  The other, which is deprecated,
- *    holds the date in text format, and will hold years up to 9999.
- *
- *    The integer is
- *        "png_uint_16 year" in png_time_struct.
- *
- *    The string is
- *        "char time_buffer[29]" in png_struct.  This is no longer used
- *    in libpng-1.6.x and will be removed from libpng-1.7.0.
- *
- *    There are seven time-related functions:
- *        png.c: png_convert_to_rfc_1123_buffer() in png.c
- *          (formerly png_convert_to_rfc_1123() prior to libpng-1.5.x and
- *          png_convert_to_rfc_1152() in error prior to libpng-0.98)
- *        png_convert_from_struct_tm() in pngwrite.c, called in pngwrite.c
- *        png_convert_from_time_t() in pngwrite.c
- *        png_get_tIME() in pngget.c
- *        png_handle_tIME() in pngrutil.c, called in pngread.c
- *        png_set_tIME() in pngset.c
- *        png_write_tIME() in pngwutil.c, called in pngwrite.c
- *
- *    All handle dates properly in a Y2K environment.  The
- *    png_convert_from_time_t() function calls gmtime() to convert from system
- *    clock time, which returns (year - 1900), which we properly convert to
- *    the full 4-digit year.  There is a possibility that libpng applications
- *    are not passing 4-digit years into the png_convert_to_rfc_1123_buffer()
- *    function, or that they are incorrectly passing only a 2-digit year
- *    instead of "year - 1900" into the png_convert_from_struct_tm() function,
- *    but this is not under our control.  The libpng documentation has always
- *    stated that it works with 4-digit years, and the APIs have been
- *    documented as such.
- *
- *    The tIME chunk itself is also Y2K compliant.  It uses a 2-byte unsigned
- *    integer to hold the year, and can hold years as large as 65535.
- *
- *    zlib, upon which libpng depends, is also Y2K compliant.  It contains
- *    no date-related code.
