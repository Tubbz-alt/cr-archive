  1 README for libpng version 1.6.37 - April 14, 2019
  2 =================================================
  3 
  4 See the note about version numbers near the top of png.h.
  5 See INSTALL for instructions on how to install libpng.
  6 
  7 Libpng comes in several distribution formats.  Get libpng-*.tar.gz or
  8 libpng-*.tar.xz or if you want UNIX-style line endings in the text
  9 files, or lpng*.7z or lpng*.zip if you want DOS-style line endings.
 10 
 11 Version 0.89 was the first official release of libpng.  Don&#39;t let the
 12 fact that it&#39;s the first release fool you.  The libpng library has been
 13 in extensive use and testing since mid-1995.  By late 1997 it had
 14 finally gotten to the stage where there hadn&#39;t been significant
 15 changes to the API in some time, and people have a bad feeling about
 16 libraries with versions &lt; 1.0.  Version 1.0.0 was released in
 17 March 1998.
 18 
 19 ****
 20 Note that some of the changes to the png_info structure render this
 21 version of the library binary incompatible with libpng-0.89 or
 22 earlier versions if you are using a shared library.  The type of the
 23 &quot;filler&quot; parameter for png_set_filler() has changed from png_byte to
 24 png_uint_32, which will affect shared-library applications that use
 25 this function.
 26 
 27 To avoid problems with changes to the internals of the png info_struct,
 28 new APIs have been made available in 0.95 to avoid direct application
 29 access to info_ptr.  These functions are the png_set_&lt;chunk&gt; and
 30 png_get_&lt;chunk&gt; functions.  These functions should be used when
 31 accessing/storing the info_struct data, rather than manipulating it
 32 directly, to avoid such problems in the future.
 33 
 34 It is important to note that the APIs did not make current programs
 35 that access the info struct directly incompatible with the new
 36 library, through libpng-1.2.x.  In libpng-1.4.x, which was meant to
 37 be a transitional release, members of the png_struct and the
 38 info_struct can still be accessed, but the compiler will issue a
 39 warning about deprecated usage.  Since libpng-1.5.0, direct access
 40 to these structs is not allowed, and the definitions of the structs
 41 reside in private pngstruct.h and pnginfo.h header files that are not
 42 accessible to applications.  It is strongly suggested that new
 43 programs use the new APIs (as shown in example.c and pngtest.c), and
 44 older programs be converted to the new format, to facilitate upgrades
 45 in the future.
 46 ****
 47 
 48 Additions since 0.90 include the ability to compile libpng as a
 49 Windows DLL, and new APIs for accessing data in the info struct.
 50 Experimental functions include the ability to set weighting and cost
 51 factors for row filter selection, direct reads of integers from buffers
 52 on big-endian processors that support misaligned data access, faster
 53 methods of doing alpha composition, and more accurate 16-&gt;8 bit color
 54 conversion.
 55 
 56 The additions since 0.89 include the ability to read from a PNG stream
 57 which has had some (or all) of the signature bytes read by the calling
 58 application.  This also allows the reading of embedded PNG streams that
 59 do not have the PNG file signature.  As well, it is now possible to set
 60 the library action on the detection of chunk CRC errors.  It is possible
 61 to set different actions based on whether the CRC error occurred in a
 62 critical or an ancillary chunk.
 63 
 64 For a detailed description on using libpng, read libpng-manual.txt.
 65 For examples of libpng in a program, see example.c and pngtest.c.  For
 66 usage information and restrictions (what little they are) on libpng,
 67 see png.h.  For a description on using zlib (the compression library
 68 used by libpng) and zlib&#39;s restrictions, see zlib.h
 69 
 70 I have included a general makefile, as well as several machine and
 71 compiler specific ones, but you may have to modify one for your own
 72 needs.
 73 
 74 You should use zlib 1.0.4 or later to run this, but it MAY work with
 75 versions as old as zlib 0.95.  Even so, there are bugs in older zlib
 76 versions which can cause the output of invalid compression streams for
 77 some images.
 78 
 79 You should also note that zlib is a compression library that is useful
 80 for more things than just PNG files.  You can use zlib as a drop-in
 81 replacement for fread() and fwrite(), if you are so inclined.
 82 
 83 zlib should be available at the same place that libpng is, or at
 84 https://zlib.net.
 85 
 86 You may also want a copy of the PNG specification.  It is available
 87 as an RFC, a W3C Recommendation, and an ISO/IEC Standard.  You can find
 88 these at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngdocs.html .

 91 [DOWNLOAD] area, and at http://libpng.download/src .
 92 
 93 This release, based in a large way on Glenn&#39;s, Guy&#39;s and Andreas&#39;
 94 earlier work, was created and will be supported by myself and the PNG
 95 development group.
