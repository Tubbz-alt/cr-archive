<span class="line-modified">  1 README for libpng version 1.6.35 - July 15, 2018 (shared library 16.0)</span>
<span class="line-modified">  2 See the note about version numbers near the top of png.h</span>
  3 

  4 See INSTALL for instructions on how to install libpng.
  5 
  6 Libpng comes in several distribution formats.  Get libpng-*.tar.gz or
<span class="line-modified">  7 libpng-*.tar.xz or if you want UNIX-style line endings in the text files,</span>
<span class="line-modified">  8 or lpng*.7z or lpng*.zip if you want DOS-style line endings.</span>
  9 
 10 Version 0.89 was the first official release of libpng.  Don&#39;t let the
<span class="line-modified"> 11 fact that it&#39;s the first release fool you.  The libpng library has been in</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 12 extensive use and testing since mid-1995.  By late 1997 it had</span>
 13 finally gotten to the stage where there hadn&#39;t been significant
 14 changes to the API in some time, and people have a bad feeling about
 15 libraries with versions &lt; 1.0.  Version 1.0.0 was released in
 16 March 1998.
 17 
 18 ****
 19 Note that some of the changes to the png_info structure render this
 20 version of the library binary incompatible with libpng-0.89 or
 21 earlier versions if you are using a shared library.  The type of the
 22 &quot;filler&quot; parameter for png_set_filler() has changed from png_byte to
 23 png_uint_32, which will affect shared-library applications that use
 24 this function.
 25 
 26 To avoid problems with changes to the internals of the png info_struct,
 27 new APIs have been made available in 0.95 to avoid direct application
 28 access to info_ptr.  These functions are the png_set_&lt;chunk&gt; and
 29 png_get_&lt;chunk&gt; functions.  These functions should be used when
 30 accessing/storing the info_struct data, rather than manipulating it
 31 directly, to avoid such problems in the future.
 32 
</pre>
<hr />
<pre>
 43 older programs be converted to the new format, to facilitate upgrades
 44 in the future.
 45 ****
 46 
 47 Additions since 0.90 include the ability to compile libpng as a
 48 Windows DLL, and new APIs for accessing data in the info struct.
 49 Experimental functions include the ability to set weighting and cost
 50 factors for row filter selection, direct reads of integers from buffers
 51 on big-endian processors that support misaligned data access, faster
 52 methods of doing alpha composition, and more accurate 16-&gt;8 bit color
 53 conversion.
 54 
 55 The additions since 0.89 include the ability to read from a PNG stream
 56 which has had some (or all) of the signature bytes read by the calling
 57 application.  This also allows the reading of embedded PNG streams that
 58 do not have the PNG file signature.  As well, it is now possible to set
 59 the library action on the detection of chunk CRC errors.  It is possible
 60 to set different actions based on whether the CRC error occurred in a
 61 critical or an ancillary chunk.
 62 
<span class="line-modified"> 63 The changes made to the library, and bugs fixed are based on discussions</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 64 on the PNG-implement mailing list and not on material submitted</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 65 privately to Guy, Andreas, or Glenn.  They will forward any good</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 66 suggestions to the list.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 67 </span>
<span class="line-removed"> 68 For a detailed description on using libpng, read libpng-manual.txt.  For</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 69 examples of libpng in a program, see example.c and pngtest.c.  For usage</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 70 information and restrictions (what little they are) on libpng, see</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 71 png.h.  For a description on using zlib (the compression library used by</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 72 libpng) and zlib&#39;s restrictions, see zlib.h</span>
 73 
 74 I have included a general makefile, as well as several machine and
<span class="line-modified"> 75 compiler specific ones, but you may have to modify one for your own needs.</span>

 76 
 77 You should use zlib 1.0.4 or later to run this, but it MAY work with
 78 versions as old as zlib 0.95.  Even so, there are bugs in older zlib
 79 versions which can cause the output of invalid compression streams for
<span class="line-modified"> 80 some images.  You will definitely need zlib 1.0.4 or later if you are</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 81 taking advantage of the MS-DOS &quot;far&quot; structure allocation for the small</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 82 and medium memory models.  You should also note that zlib is a</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 83 compression library that is useful for more things than just PNG files.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 84 You can use zlib as a drop-in replacement for fread() and fwrite() if</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 85 you are so inclined.</span>
 86 
<span class="line-modified"> 87 zlib should be available at the same place that libpng is, or at zlib.net.</span>

 88 
 89 You may also want a copy of the PNG specification.  It is available
 90 as an RFC, a W3C Recommendation, and an ISO/IEC Standard.  You can find
 91 these at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngdocs.html .
 92 
 93 This code is currently being archived at libpng.sourceforge.io in the
<span class="line-modified"> 94 [DOWNLOAD] area, and at http://libpng.download/src .  If you</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 95 can&#39;t find it in any of those places, e-mail me, and I&#39;ll help you find it.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 96 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 97 I am not a lawyer, but I believe that the Export Control Classification</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 98 Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 99 controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because it</span>
<span class="line-removed">100 is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain any</span>
<span class="line-removed">101 encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and 734.7(b).</span>
<span class="line-removed">102 </span>
<span class="line-removed">103 If you have any code changes, requests, problems, etc., please e-mail</span>
<span class="line-removed">104 them to me.  Also, I&#39;d appreciate any make files or project files,</span>
<span class="line-removed">105 and any modifications you needed to make to get libpng to compile,</span>
<span class="line-removed">106 along with a #define variable to tell what compiler/system you are on.</span>
<span class="line-removed">107 If you needed to add transformations to libpng, or wish libpng would</span>
<span class="line-removed">108 provide the image in a different way, drop me a note (and code, if</span>
<span class="line-removed">109 possible), so I can consider supporting the transformation.</span>
<span class="line-removed">110 Finally, if you get any warning messages when compiling libpng</span>
<span class="line-removed">111 (note: not zlib), and they are easy to fix, I&#39;d appreciate the</span>
<span class="line-removed">112 fix.  Please mention &quot;libpng&quot; somewhere in the subject line.  Thanks.</span>
<span class="line-removed">113 </span>
<span class="line-removed">114 This release was created and will be supported by myself (of course</span>
<span class="line-removed">115 based in a large way on Guy&#39;s and Andreas&#39; earlier work), and the PNG</span>
116 development group.
