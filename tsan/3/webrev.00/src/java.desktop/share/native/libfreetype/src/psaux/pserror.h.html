 60    * A poor-man error facility.
 61    *
 62    * This code being written in vanilla C, doesn&#39;t have the luxury of a
 63    * language-supported exception mechanism such as the one available in
 64    * Java.  Instead, we are stuck with using error codes that must be
 65    * carefully managed and preserved.  However, it is convenient for us to
 66    * model our error mechanism on a Java-like exception mechanism.
 67    * When we assign an error code we are thus `throwing&#39; an error.
 68    *
 69    * The preservation of an error code is done by coding convention.
 70    * Upon a function call if the error code is anything other than
 71    * `FT_Err_Ok&#39;, which is guaranteed to be zero, we
 72    * will return without altering that error.  This will allow the
 73    * error to propagate and be handled at the appropriate location in
 74    * the code.
 75    *
 76    * This allows a style of code where the error code is initialized
 77    * up front and a block of calls are made with the error code only
 78    * being checked after the block.  If a new error occurs, the original
 79    * error will be preserved and a functional no-op should result in any
 80    * subsequent function that has an initial error code not equal to
 81    * `FT_Err_Ok&#39;.
 82    *
 83    * Errors are encoded by calling the `FT_THROW&#39; macro.  For example,
 84    *
 85    * {
 86    *   FT_Error  e;
 87    *
 88    *
 89    *   ...
 90    *   e = FT_THROW( Out_Of_Memory );
 91    * }
