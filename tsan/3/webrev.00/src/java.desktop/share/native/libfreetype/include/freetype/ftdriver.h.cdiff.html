     *   @FT_Property_Get.
     *
<span class="line-modified">!    *   The CFF driver&#39;s module name is `cff&#39;.</span>
     *
     *   Available properties are @hinting-engine, @no-stem-darkening,
     *   @darkening-parameters, and @random-seed, as documented in the
     *   @properties section.
     *
     *
<span class="line-modified">!    *   *Hinting* *and* *antialiasing* *principles* *of* *the* *new* *engine*</span>
     *
     *   The rasterizer is positioning horizontal features (e.g., ascender
     *   height &amp; x-height, or crossbars) on the pixel grid and minimizing the
     *   amount of antialiasing applied to them, while placing vertical
     *   features (vertical stems) on the pixel grid without hinting, thus
     *   representing the stem position and weight accurately.  Sometimes the
     *   vertical stems may be only partially black.  In this context,
<span class="line-modified">!    *   `antialiasing&#39; means that stems are not positioned exactly on pixel</span>
     *   borders, causing a fuzzy appearance.
     *
     *   There are two principles behind this approach.
     *
<span class="line-modified">!    *   1) No hinting in the horizontal direction: Unlike `superhinted&#39;</span>
     *   TrueType, which changes glyph widths to accommodate regular
<span class="line-modified">!    *   inter-glyph spacing, Adobe&#39;s approach is `faithful to the design&#39; in</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   representing both the glyph width and the inter-glyph spacing</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   designed for the font.  This makes the screen display as close as it</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   can be to the result one would get with infinite resolution, while</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   preserving what is considered the key characteristics of each glyph.</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   Note that the distances between unhinted and grid-fitted positions at</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   small sizes are comparable to kerning values and thus would be</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   noticeable (and distracting) while reading if hinting were applied.</span>
     *
     *   One of the reasons to not hint horizontally is antialiasing for LCD
<span class="line-modified">!    *   screens: The pixel geometry of modern displays supplies three</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   vertical subpixels as the eye moves horizontally across each visible</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   pixel.  On devices where we can be certain this characteristic is</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   present a rasterizer can take advantage of the subpixels to add</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   increments of weight.  In Western writing systems this turns out to</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   be the more critical direction anyway; the weights and spacing of</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   vertical stems (see above) are central to Armenian, Cyrillic, Greek,</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   and Latin type designs.  Even when the rasterizer uses greyscale</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   antialiasing instead of color (a necessary compromise when one</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   doesn&#39;t know the screen characteristics), the unhinted vertical</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   features preserve the design&#39;s weight and spacing much better than</span>
<span class="line-removed">-    *   aliased type would.</span>
     *
     *   2) Alignment in the vertical direction: Weights and spacing along the
     *   y~axis are less critical; what is much more important is the visual
     *   alignment of related features (like cap-height and x-height).  The
     *   sense of alignment for these is enhanced by the sharpness of grid-fit
     *   edges, while the cruder vertical resolution (full pixels instead of
     *   1/3 pixels) is less of a problem.
     *
     *   On the technical side, horizontal alignment zones for ascender,
     *   x-height, and other important height values (traditionally called
<span class="line-modified">!    *   `blue zones&#39;) as defined in the font are positioned independently,</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   each being rounded to the nearest pixel edge, taking care of</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   overshoot suppression at small sizes, stem darkening, and scaling.</span>
     *
     *   Hstems (this is, hint values defined in the font to help align
     *   horizontal features) that fall within a blue zone are said to be
<span class="line-modified">!    *   `captured&#39; and are aligned to that zone.  Uncaptured stems are moved</span>
     *   in one of four ways, top edge up or down, bottom edge up or down.
<span class="line-modified">!    *   Unless there are conflicting hstems, the smallest movement is taken</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   to minimize distortion.</span>

     *
<span class="line-modified">!    *   _Bi-Level_ _Rendering_</span>
     *
     *   Monochromatic rendering, exclusively used in the early days of
     *   TrueType by both Apple and Microsoft.  Microsoft&#39;s GDI interface
     *   supported hinting of the right-side bearing point, such that the
     *   advance width could be non-linear.  Most often this was done to
     *   achieve some level of glyph symmetry.  To enable reasonable
<span class="line-modified">!    *   performance (e.g., not having to run hinting on all glyphs just to</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   get the widths) there was a bit in the head table indicating if the</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   side bearing was hinted, and additional tables, `hdmx&#39; and `LTSH&#39;, to</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   cache hinting widths across multiple sizes and device aspect ratios.</span>
     *
<span class="line-modified">!    *   _Font_ _Smoothing_</span>
     *
     *   Microsoft&#39;s GDI implementation of anti-aliasing.  Not traditional
     *   anti-aliasing as the outlines were hinted before the sampling.  The
     *   widths matched the bi-level rendering.
     *
<span class="line-modified">!    *   _ClearType_ _Rendering_</span>
     *
     *   Technique that uses physical subpixels to improve rendering on LCD
     *   (and other) displays.  Because of the higher resolution, many methods
<span class="line-modified">!    *   of improving symmetry in glyphs through hinting the right-side</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   bearing were no longer necessary.  This lead to what GDI calls</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   `natural widths&#39; ClearType, see</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec21.  Since hinting</span>
     *   has extra resolution, most non-linearity went away, but it is still
     *   possible for hints to change the advance widths in this mode.
     *
<span class="line-modified">!    *   _ClearType_ _Compatible_ _Widths_</span>
     *
     *   One of the earliest challenges with ClearType was allowing the
     *   implementation in GDI to be selected without requiring all UI and

     *   While FreeType&#39;s TrueType driver doesn&#39;t expose API functions by
     *   itself, it is possible to control its behaviour with @FT_Property_Set
     *   and @FT_Property_Get.  The following lists the available properties
     *   together with the necessary macros and structures.
     *
<span class="line-modified">!    *   The TrueType driver&#39;s module name is &#39;truetype&#39;.</span>
     *
     *   A single property @interpreter-version is available, as documented in
     *   the @properties section.
     *
     *   We start with a list of definitions, kindly provided by Greg
     *   Hitchcock.
     *
<span class="line-modified">!    *   _Bi-Level Rendering_</span>
     *
     *   Monochromatic rendering, exclusively used in the early days of
     *   TrueType by both Apple and Microsoft.  Microsoft&#39;s GDI interface
     *   supported hinting of the right-side bearing point, such that the
     *   advance width could be non-linear.  Most often this was done to
     *   achieve some level of glyph symmetry.  To enable reasonable
<span class="line-modified">!    *   performance (e.g., not having to run hinting on all glyphs just to get</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   the widths) there was a bit in the head table indicating if the side</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   bearing was hinted, and additional tables, &#39;hdmx&#39; and &#39;LTSH&#39;, to cache</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   hinting widths across multiple sizes and device aspect ratios.</span>
     *
<span class="line-modified">!    *   _Font Smoothing_</span>
     *
     *   Microsoft&#39;s GDI implementation of anti-aliasing.  Not traditional
     *   anti-aliasing as the outlines were hinted before the sampling.  The
     *   widths matched the bi-level rendering.
     *
<span class="line-modified">!    *   _ClearType Rendering_</span>
     *
     *   Technique that uses physical subpixels to improve rendering on LCD
     *   (and other) displays.  Because of the higher resolution, many methods
<span class="line-modified">!    *   of improving symmetry in glyphs through hinting the right-side bearing</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   were no longer necessary.  This lead to what GDI calls &#39;natural</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   widths&#39; ClearType, see</span>
<span class="line-modified">!    *   http://rastertragedy.com/RTRCh4.htm#Sec21.  Since hinting</span>
     *   has extra resolution, most non-linearity went away, but it is still
     *   possible for hints to change the advance widths in this mode.
     *
<span class="line-modified">!    *   _ClearType Compatible Widths_</span>
     *
     *   One of the earliest challenges with ClearType was allowing the
     *   implementation in GDI to be selected without requiring all UI and
     *   documents to reflow.  To address this, a compatible method of
     *   rendering ClearType was added where the font hints are executed once
     *   to determine the width in bi-level rendering, and then re-run in
     *   ClearType, with the difference in widths being absorbed in the font
     *   hints for ClearType (mostly in the white space of hints); see
<span class="line-modified">!    *   http://rastertragedy.com/RTRCh4.htm#Sec20.  Somewhat by</span>
     *   definition, compatible width ClearType allows for non-linear widths,
     *   but only when the bi-level version has non-linear widths.
     *
<span class="line-modified">!    *   _ClearType Subpixel Positioning_</span>
     *
     *   One of the nice benefits of ClearType is the ability to more crisply
     *   display fractional widths; unfortunately, the GDI model of integer
     *   bitmaps did not support this.  However, the WPF and Direct Write

     *     Windows~98; only grayscale and B/W rasterizing is supported.
     *
     *   TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_38 ::
     *     Version~38 corresponds to MS rasterizer v.1.9; it is roughly
     *     equivalent to the hinting provided by DirectWrite ClearType (as can
     *     be found, for example, in the Internet Explorer~9 running on
<span class="line-modified">!    *     Windows~7).  It is used in FreeType to select the &#39;Infinality&#39;</span>

     *
     *   TT_INTERPRETER_VERSION_40 ::

     *     equivalent to the hinting provided by DirectWrite ClearType (as can
     *     be found, for example, in Microsoft&#39;s Edge Browser on Windows~10).
<span class="line-modified">!    *     It is used in FreeType to select the &#39;minimal&#39; subpixel hinting</span>

     *
     * @note:
