 32  * This keeps track of data that needs to be cleaned up once a
 33  * strike is freed.
 34  * a) The native memory that is the glyph image cache.
 35  * b) removing the &quot;desc&quot; key from the strike&#39;s map.
 36  * This is safe to do because this disposer is invoked only when the
 37  * reference object has been cleared, which means the value indexed by
 38  * this key is just an empty reference object.
 39  * It is possible that a new FontStrike has been created that would
 40  * be referenced by the same (equals) key. If it is placed in the map
 41  * before this disposer is executed, then we do not want to remove that
 42  * object. We should only remove an object where the value is null.
 43  * So we first verify that the key still points to a cleared reference.
 44  * Updates to the map thus need to be synchronized.
 45  *
 46  * A WeakHashmap will automatically clean up, but we might maintain a
 47  * reference to the &quot;desc&quot; key in the FontStrike (value) which would
 48  * prevent the keys from being discarded. And since the strike is the only
 49  * place is likely we would maintain such a strong reference, then the map
 50  * entries would be removed much more promptly than we need.
