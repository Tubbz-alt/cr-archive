 41  * different ways to do this
 42  * 1) each physical font2d keeps a hashtable mapping scripts to layout
 43  * engines, we query and fill this cache.
 44  * 2) we keep a mapping independent of font using the key Most likely
 45  * few fonts will be used, so option 2 seems better
 46  *
 47  * Once we know which engine to use for a font, we always know, so we
 48  * shouldn&#39;t have to recheck each time we do layout.  So the cache is
 49  * ok.
 50  *
 51  * Should we reuse engines?  We could instantiate an engine for each
 52  * font/script pair.  The engine would hold onto the table(s) from the
 53  * font that it needs.  If we have multiple threads using the same
 54  * engine, we still need to keep the state separate, so the native
 55  * engines would still need to be allocated for each call, since they
 56  * keep their state in themselves.  If they used the passed-in GVData
 57  * arrays directly (with some checks for space) then since each GVData
 58  * is different per thread, we could reuse the layout engines.  This
 59  * still requires a separate layout engine per font, because of the
 60  * table state in the engine.  If we pushed that out too and passed it
 61  * in with the native call as well, we&#39;d be ok if the layout engines
 62  * keep all their process state on the stack, but I don&#39;t know if this
 63  * is true.  Then we&#39;d basically just be down to an engine index which
 64  * we pass into native and then invoke the engine code (now a
 65  * procedure call, not an object invocation) based on a switch on the
 66  * index.  There would be only half a dozen engine objects then, not
 67  * potentially half a dozen per font.  But we&#39;d have to stack-allocate
 68  * some state that included the pointer to the required font tables.
 69  *
 70  * Seems for now that the way to do things is to come in with a
 71  * selector and the font.  The selector indicates which engine to use,
 72  * the engine is stack allocated and initialized with the required
 73  * font tables (the selector indicates which).  Then layout is called,
 74  * the contents are copied (or not), and the stack is destroyed on
 75  * exit. So the association is between the font/script (layout engine
 76  * desc) and one of a few permanent engine objects, which are
 77  * handed the key when they need to process something.  In the native
 78  * case, the engine holds an index, and just passes it together with
 79  * the key info down to native.  Some default cases are the &#39;default
 80  * layout&#39; case that just runs the c2gmapper, this stays in java and
 81  * just uses the mapper from the font/strike.  Another default case
 82  * might be the unicode arabic shaper, since this doesn&#39;t care about
 83  * the font (or script or lang?) it wouldn&#39;t need to extract this
 84  * data.  It could be (yikes) ported back to java even to avoid
 85  * upcalls to check if the font supports a particular unicode
 86  * character.
 87  *
 88  * I&#39;d expect that the majority of scripts use the default mapper for
 89  * a particular font.  Loading the hastable with 40 or so keys 30+ of
 90  * which all map to the same object is unfortunate.  It might be worth
 91  * instead having a per-font list of &#39;scripts with non-default
 92  * engines&#39;, e.g. the factory has a hashtable mapping fonts to &#39;script
 93  * lists&#39; (the factory has this since the design potentially has other
 94  * factories, though I admit there&#39;s no client for this yet and no
 95  * public api) and then the script list is queried for the script in
 96  * question.  it can be preloaded at creation time with all the
 97  * scripts that don&#39;t have default engines-- either a list or a hash
 98  * table, so a null return from the table means &#39;default&#39; and not &#39;i
 99  * don&#39;t know yet&#39;.
100  *
101  * On the other hand, in most all cases the number of unique
102  * script/font combinations will be small, so a flat hashtable should
103  * suffice.
