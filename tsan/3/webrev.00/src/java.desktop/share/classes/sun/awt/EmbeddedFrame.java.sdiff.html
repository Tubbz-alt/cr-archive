 39  * An EmbeddedFrame has two related uses:
 40  *
 41  * . Within a Java-based application, an EmbeddedFrame serves as a sort of
 42  *   firewall, preventing the contained components or applets from using
 43  *   getParent() to find parent components, such as menubars.
 44  *
 45  * . Within a C-based application, an EmbeddedFrame contains a window handle
 46  *   which was created by the application, which serves as the top-level
 47  *   Java window.  EmbeddedFrames created for this purpose are passed-in a
 48  *   handle of an existing window created by the application.  The window
 49  *   handle should be of the appropriate native type for a specific
 50  *   platform, as stored in the pData field of the ComponentPeer.
