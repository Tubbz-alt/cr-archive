  79  * The default layout for a window is {@code BorderLayout}.
  80  * &lt;p&gt;
  81  * A window must have either a frame, dialog, or another window defined as its
  82  * owner when it&#39;s constructed.
  83  * &lt;p&gt;
  84  * In a multi-screen environment, you can create a {@code Window}
  85  * on a different screen device by constructing the {@code Window}
  86  * with {@link #Window(Window, GraphicsConfiguration)}.  The
  87  * {@code GraphicsConfiguration} object is one of the
  88  * {@code GraphicsConfiguration} objects of the target screen device.
  89  * &lt;p&gt;
  90  * In a virtual device multi-screen environment in which the desktop
  91  * area could span multiple physical screen devices, the bounds of all
  92  * configurations are relative to the virtual device coordinate system.
  93  * The origin of the virtual-coordinate system is at the upper left-hand
  94  * corner of the primary physical screen.  Depending on the location of
  95  * the primary screen in the virtual device, negative coordinates are
  96  * possible, as shown in the following figure.
  97  * &lt;p&gt;
  98  * &lt;img src=&quot;doc-files/MultiScreen.gif&quot;
<span class="line-modified">  99  * alt=&quot;Diagram shows virtual device containing 4 physical screens. Primary physical screen shows coords (0,0), other screen shows (-80,-100).&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 100  * style=&quot;float:center; margin: 7px 10px;&quot;&gt;</span>

 101  * &lt;p&gt;
 102  * In such an environment, when calling {@code setLocation},
 103  * you must pass a virtual coordinate to this method.  Similarly,
 104  * calling {@code getLocationOnScreen} on a {@code Window} returns
 105  * virtual device coordinates.  Call the {@code getBounds} method
 106  * of a {@code GraphicsConfiguration} to find its origin in the virtual
 107  * coordinate system.
 108  * &lt;p&gt;
 109  * The following code sets the location of a {@code Window}
 110  * at (10, 10) relative to the origin of the physical screen
 111  * of the corresponding {@code GraphicsConfiguration}.  If the
 112  * bounds of the {@code GraphicsConfiguration} is not taken
 113  * into account, the {@code Window} location would be set
 114  * at (10, 10) relative to the virtual-coordinate system and would appear
 115  * on the primary physical screen, which might be different from the
 116  * physical screen of the specified {@code GraphicsConfiguration}.
 117  *
 118  * &lt;pre&gt;
 119  *      Window w = new Window(Window owner, GraphicsConfiguration gc);
 120  *      Rectangle bounds = gc.getBounds();
