 37  * A check box is a graphical component that can be in either an
 38  * &quot;on&quot; ({@code true}) or &quot;off&quot; ({@code false}) state.
 39  * Clicking on a check box changes its state from
 40  * &quot;on&quot; to &quot;off,&quot; or from &quot;off&quot; to &quot;on.&quot;
 41  * &lt;p&gt;
 42  * The following code example creates a set of check boxes in
 43  * a grid layout:
 44  *
 45  * &lt;hr&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 46  * setLayout(new GridLayout(3, 1));
 47  * add(new Checkbox(&quot;one&quot;, null, true));
 48  * add(new Checkbox(&quot;two&quot;));
 49  * add(new Checkbox(&quot;three&quot;));
 50  * &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
 51  * &lt;p&gt;
 52  * This image depicts the check boxes and grid layout
 53  * created by this code example:
 54  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 55  * &lt;img src=&quot;doc-files/Checkbox-1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The following context describes the graphic.&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 56  * style=&quot;float:center; margin: 7px 10px;&quot;&gt;</span>
 57  * &lt;p&gt;
 58  * The button labeled {@code one} is in the &quot;on&quot; state, and the
 59  * other two are in the &quot;off&quot; state. In this example, which uses the
 60  * {@code GridLayout} class, the states of the three check
 61  * boxes are set independently.
 62  * &lt;p&gt;
 63  * Alternatively, several check boxes can be grouped together under
 64  * the control of a single object, using the
 65  * {@code CheckboxGroup} class.
 66  * In a check box group, at most one button can be in the &quot;on&quot;
 67  * state at any given time. Clicking on a check box to turn it on
 68  * forces any other check box in the same group that is on
 69  * into the &quot;off&quot; state.
