 39  * The {@code Choice} class presents a pop-up menu of choices.
 40  * The current choice is displayed as the title of the menu.
 41  * &lt;p&gt;
 42  * The following code example produces a pop-up menu:
 43  *
 44  * &lt;hr&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 45  * Choice ColorChooser = new Choice();
 46  * ColorChooser.add(&quot;Green&quot;);
 47  * ColorChooser.add(&quot;Red&quot;);
 48  * ColorChooser.add(&quot;Blue&quot;);
 49  * &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
 50  * &lt;p&gt;
 51  * After this choice menu has been added to a panel,
 52  * it appears as follows in its normal state:
 53  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 54  * &lt;img src=&quot;doc-files/Choice-1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;The following text describes the graphic&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 55  * style=&quot;float:center; margin: 7px 10px;&quot;&gt;</span>
 56  * &lt;p&gt;
 57  * In the picture, {@code &quot;Green&quot;} is the current choice.
 58  * Pushing the mouse button down on the object causes a menu to
 59  * appear with the current choice highlighted.
 60  * &lt;p&gt;
 61  * Some native platforms do not support arbitrary resizing of
 62  * {@code Choice} components and the behavior of
 63  * {@code setSize()/getSize()} is bound by
 64  * such limitations.
 65  * Native GUI {@code Choice} components&#39; size are often bound by such
 66  * attributes as font size and length of items contained within
 67  * the {@code Choice}.
