  78  * In a virtual device multi-screen environment in which the desktop
  79  * area could span multiple physical screen devices, the bounds of all
  80  * configurations are relative to the virtual-coordinate system.  The
  81  * origin of the virtual-coordinate system is at the upper left-hand
  82  * corner of the primary physical screen.  Depending on the location
  83  * of the primary screen in the virtual device, negative coordinates
  84  * are possible, as shown in the following figure.
