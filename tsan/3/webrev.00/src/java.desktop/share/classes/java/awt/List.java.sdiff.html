  59  * &lt;p&gt;

  63  * &lt;img src=&quot;doc-files/List-1.gif&quot;
<span class="line-modified">  64  * alt=&quot;Shows a list containing: Venus, Earth, JavaSoft, and Mars. Javasoft is selected.&quot; style=&quot;float:center; margin: 7px 10px;&quot;&gt;</span>

  65  * &lt;p&gt;
  66  * If the List allows multiple selections, then clicking on
  67  * an item that is already selected deselects it. In the preceding
  68  * example, only one item from the scrolling list can be selected
  69  * at a time, since the second argument when creating the new scrolling
  70  * list is {@code false}. If the List does not allow multiple
  71  * selections, selecting an item causes any other selected item
  72  * to be deselected.
  73  * &lt;p&gt;
  74  * Note that the list in the example shown was created with four visible
  75  * rows.  Once the list has been created, the number of visible rows
  76  * cannot be changed.  A default {@code List} is created with
  77  * four rows, so that {@code lst = new List()} is equivalent to
  78  * {@code list = new List(4, false)}.
  79  * &lt;p&gt;
  80  * Beginning with Java&amp;nbsp;1.1, the Abstract Window Toolkit
  81  * sends the {@code List} object all mouse, keyboard, and focus events
  82  * that occur over it. (The old AWT event model is being maintained
  83  * only for backwards compatibility, and its use is discouraged.)
