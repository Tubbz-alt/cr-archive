  * This image depicts the check boxes and grid layout
  * created by this code example:
  * <p>
- * <img src="doc-files/Checkbox-1.gif" alt="The following context describes the graphic."
- * style="float:center; margin: 7px 10px;">
+ * <img src="doc-files/Checkbox-1.gif" alt="The following context describes the
+ * graphic." style="margin: 7px 10px;">
  * <p>
  * The button labeled {@code one} is in the "on" state, and the
  * other two are in the "off" state. In this example, which uses the
  * {@code GridLayout} class, the states of the three check
  * boxes are set independently.
