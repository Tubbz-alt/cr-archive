  34       &lt;h1&gt;The AWT Focus Subsystem&lt;/h1&gt;
  35 
  36     &lt;p&gt;
  37       Prior to Java 2 Standard Edition, JDK 1.4, the AWT focus subsystem
  38       was inadequate. It suffered from major design and API problems,
  39       as well as over a hundred open bugs. Many of these bugs were caused by
  40       platform inconsistencies, or incompatibilities between the native
  41       focus system for heavyweights and the Java focus system for
  42       lightweights.
  43     &lt;p&gt;
  44       The single worst problem with the AWT focus implementation was the
  45       inability to query for the currently focused Component. Not only was
  46       there no API for such a query, but also, because of an insufficient
  47       architecture, such information was not even maintained by the code.
  48     &lt;p&gt;
  49       Almost as bad was the inability of lightweight children of a Window
  50       (not a Frame or a Dialog) to receive keyboard input. This problem
  51       existed because Windows never received &lt;code&gt;WINDOW_ACTIVATED&lt;/code&gt;
  52       events and thus could never be activated, and only active Windows
  53       could contain focused Components.

1345           traversal operations, and
1346           &lt;code&gt;Component.handleEvent()&lt;/code&gt; will no longer be invoked
1347           for such events. Previously, AWT Components saw these events
1348           and had an opportunity to consume them before AWT
1349           initiated focus traversal. Code that requires this
1350           functionality should instead disable focus traversal keys on
1351           its &lt;code&gt;Component&lt;/code&gt;s and handle focus traversal
1352           itself. Alternately, the code can use an
1353           &lt;code&gt;AWTEventListener&lt;/code&gt; or
1354           &lt;code&gt;KeyEventDispatcher&lt;/code&gt; to pre-listen to all
1355           &lt;code&gt;KeyEvent&lt;/code&gt;s.
1356     &lt;/ol&gt;
1357   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changes specific to Microsoft Windows:&lt;/b&gt;
1358     &lt;ol&gt;
1359       &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Window.toBack()&lt;/code&gt; changes the focused Window to
1360           the top-most Window after the Z-order change.
1361       &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;requestFocus()&lt;/code&gt; now allows cross-Window focus
1362           change requests in all cases. Previously, requests were granted
1363           for heavyweights, but denied for lightweights.
1364     &lt;/ol&gt;

1365   &lt;/main&gt;
