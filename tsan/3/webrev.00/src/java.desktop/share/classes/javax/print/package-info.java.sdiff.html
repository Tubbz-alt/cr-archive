 27  * Provides the principal classes and interfaces for the Java&amp;trade; Print
 28  * Service API. The Java Print Service API enables client and server
 29  * applications to:
 30  * &lt;ul&gt;
 31  *   &lt;li&gt;Discover and select print services based on their capabilities
 32  *   &lt;li&gt;Specify the format of print data
 33  *   &lt;li&gt;Submit print jobs to services that support the document type to be
 34  *   printed.
 35  * &lt;/ul&gt;
 36  *
<span class="line-modified"> 37  * &lt;h3&gt;Print Service Discovery&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
 38  * An application invokes the static methods of the abstract class
 39  * {@link javax.print.PrintServiceLookup PrintServiceLookup} to locate print
 40  * services that have the capabilities to satisfy the application&#39;s print
 41  * request. For example, to print a double-sided document, the application first
 42  * needs to find printers that have the double-sided printing capability.
 43  * &lt;p&gt;
 44  * The JDK includes {@code PrintServiceLookup} implementations that can locate
 45  * the standard platform printers. To locate other types of printers, such as
 46  * IPP printers or JINI printers, a print-service provider can write
 47  * implementations of {@code PrintServiceLookup}. The print-service provider can
 48  * dynamically install these {@code PrintServiceLookup} implementations using
 49  * the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} facility.
 50  *
<span class="line-modified"> 51  * &lt;h3&gt;Attribute Definitions&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
 52  * The {@link javax.print.attribute} and {@link javax.print.attribute.standard}
 53  * packages define print attributes, which describe the capabilities of a print
 54  * service, specify the requirements of a print job, and track the progress of a
 55  * print job.
 56  * &lt;p&gt;
 57  * The {@code javax.print.attribute} package describes the types of attributes
 58  * and how they can be collected into sets. The
 59  * {@code javax.print.attribute.standard} package enumerates all of the standard
 60  * attributes supported by the API, most of which are implementations of
 61  * attributes specified in the IETF Specification,
 62  * &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2911.txt&quot;&gt;RFC 2911 Internet Printing
 63  * Protocol, 1.1: Model and Semantics&lt;/a&gt;, dated September 2000. The attributes
 64  * specified in {@code javax.print.attribute.standard} include common
 65  * capabilities, such as: resolution, copies, media sizes, job priority, and
 66  * page ranges.
 67  *
<span class="line-modified"> 68  * &lt;h3&gt;Document Type Specification&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
 69  * The {@link javax.print.DocFlavor DocFlavor} class represents the print data
 70  * format, such as JPEG or PostScript. A {@code DocFlavor} object consists of a
 71  * MIME type, which describes the format, and a document representation class
 72  * name that indicates how the document is delivered to the printer or output
 73  * stream. An application uses the {@code DocFlavor} and an attribute set to
 74  * find printers that can print the document type specified by the
 75  * {@code DocFlavor} and have the capabilities specified by the attribute set.
 76  *
<span class="line-modified"> 77  * &lt;h3&gt;Using the API&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
 78  * A typical application using the Java Print Service API performs these steps
 79  * to process a print request:
 80  * &lt;ol&gt;
 81  *   &lt;li&gt;Chooses a {@code DocFlavor}.
 82  *   &lt;li&gt;Creates a set of attributes.
 83  *   &lt;li&gt;Locates a print service that can handle the print request as specified
 84  *   by the {@code DocFlavor} and the attribute set.
 85  *   &lt;li&gt;Creates a {@link javax.print.Doc Doc} object encapsulating the
 86  *   {@code DocFlavor} and the actual print data, which can take many forms
 87  *   including: a Postscript file, a JPEG image, a {@code URL}, or plain text.
 88  *   &lt;li&gt;Gets a print job, represented by
 89  *   {@link javax.print.DocPrintJob DocPrintJob}, from the print service.
 90  *   &lt;li&gt;Calls the print method of the print job.
 91  * &lt;/ol&gt;
 92  * The following code sample demonstrates a typical use of the Java Print
 93  * Service API: locating printers that can print five double-sided copies of a
 94  * Postscript document on size A4 paper, creating a print job from one of the
 95  * returned print services, and calling print.
 96  * &lt;blockquote&gt;
