 82      * This custom palette is derived from the IE palette.
 83      * Previously, we used a custom palette that used a patented
 84      * algorithm for getting an evently distributed color space.
 85      * But given the realites of desktop and web graphics, it seems
 86      * more important to use a more standard palette, especially one
 87      * that agrees with the predominant browser.  The browser uses
 88      * a slightly modified 6x6x6 colorcube plus a gray ramp plus a
 89      * few other colors.  We still flash with Netscape, but we end
 90      * up using a very similar palette (Netscape uses a 6x6x6 color
 91      * cube as well); the entries are just in different places (thus
 92      * the flash).
 93      * Another possible solution to use a standard palette would be
 94      * to use the CreateHalftonePalette() call of win32.  This gives
 95      * us the IE palette on win98, but totally different palettes on
 96      * different versions of Windows.  We should at least use the same
 97      * colors on different flavors of the same platform...
 98      * The values coded below should be used for entries 10 through
 99      * 245 of our custom palette.  Entries 0-9 and 246-255 should be
100      * retrieved from the current system palette, to ensure that we
101      * are working well with the current desktop palette.
102      *
103      * The palette is initialized in awt_CustomPaletteDef.h
