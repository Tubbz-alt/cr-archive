 76      * This custom palette is derived from the IE palette.
 77      * Previously, we used a custom palette that used a patented
 78      * algorithm for getting an evently distributed color space.
 79      * But given the realites of desktop and web graphics, it seems
 80      * more important to use a more standard palette, especially one
 81      * that agrees with the predominant browser.  The browser uses
 82      * a slightly modified 6x6x6 colorcube plus a gray ramp plus a
 83      * few other colors.  We still flash with Netscape, but we end
 84      * up using a very similar palette (Netscape uses a 6x6x6 color
 85      * cube as well); the entries are just in different places (thus
 86      * the flash).
 87      * Another possible solution to use a standard palette would be
 88      * to use the CreateHalftonePalette() call of win32.  This gives
 89      * us the IE palette on win98, but totally different palettes on
 90      * different versions of Windows.  We should at least use the same
 91      * colors on different flavors of the same platform...
 92      * The values coded below should be used for entries 10 through
 93      * 245 of our custom palette.  Entries 0-9 and 246-255 should be
 94      * retrieved from the current system palette, to ensure that we
 95      * are working well with the current desktop palette.
 96      *
 97      * The palette is initialized in awt_CustomPaletteDef.h
