27  * Provides the implementation of the DNS Java Naming provider.
28  *
29  * &lt;h2&gt;Environment Properties&lt;/h2&gt;
30  *
31  * &lt;p&gt; The following JNDI environment properties may be used when creating
32  * the initial context.
33  *
34  * &lt;ul&gt;
35  *    &lt;li&gt;com.sun.jndi.dns.timeout.initial&lt;/li&gt;
36  *    &lt;li&gt;com.sun.jndi.dns.timeout.retries&lt;/li&gt;
37  *  &lt;/ul&gt;
38  *
39  * &lt;p&gt; These properties are used to alter the timeout-related defaults that the
40  * DNS provider uses when submitting queries. The DNS provider submits queries
41  * using the following exponential backoff algorithm. The provider submits a
42  * query to a DNS server and waits for a response to arrive within a timeout
43  * period (1 second by default). If it receives no response within the timeout
44  * period, it queries the next server, and so on. If the provider receives no
45  * response from any server, it doubles the timeout period and repeats the
46  * process of submitting the query to each server, up to a maximum number of
47  * retries (4 by default).
48  *
49  * &lt;p&gt; The {@code com.sun.jndi.dns.timeout.initial} property, if set, specifies
50  * the number of milliseconds to use as the initial timeout period (i.e., before
51  * any doubling). If this property has not been set, the default initial timeout
52  * is 1000 milliseconds.
53  *
54  * &lt;p&gt; The {@code com.sun.jndi.dns.timeout.retries} property, if set, specifies
55  * the number of times to retry each server using the exponential backoff
56  * algorithm described previously. If this property has not been set, the
57  * default number of retries is 4.
58  *
