<span class="line-added">43  * period (1 second by default). If it receives no response within the timeout</span>

<span class="line-added">45  * response from any server, it doubles the timeout period and repeats the</span>
<span class="line-added">46  * process of submitting the query to each server, up to a maximum number of</span>
