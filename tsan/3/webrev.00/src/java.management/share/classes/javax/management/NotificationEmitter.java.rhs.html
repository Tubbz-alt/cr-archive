31  * &lt;p&gt;Interface implemented by an MBean that emits Notifications. It
32  * allows a listener to be registered with the MBean as a notification
33  * listener.&lt;/p&gt;
34  *
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">35  * &lt;h2&gt;Notification dispatch&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
36  *
37  *&lt;p&gt;When an MBean emits a notification, it considers each listener that has been
38  * added with {@link #addNotificationListener addNotificationListener} and not
39  * subsequently removed with {@link #removeNotificationListener removeNotificationListener}.
40  * If a filter was provided with that listener, and if the filter&#39;s
41  * {@link NotificationFilter#isNotificationEnabled isNotificationEnabled} method returns
42  * false, the listener is ignored.  Otherwise, the listener&#39;s
43  * {@link NotificationListener#handleNotification handleNotification} method is called with
44  * the notification, as well as the handback object that was provided to
45  * {@code addNotificationListener}.&lt;/p&gt;
46  *
47  * &lt;p&gt;If the same listener is added more than once, it is considered as many times as it was
48  * added.  It is often useful to add the same listener with different filters or handback
49  * objects.&lt;/p&gt;
50  *
51  * &lt;p&gt;Implementations of this interface can differ regarding the thread in which the methods
52  * of filters and listeners are called.&lt;/p&gt;
53  *
54  * &lt;p&gt;If the method call of a filter or listener throws an {@link Exception}, then that
55  * exception should not prevent other listeners from being invoked.  However, if the method
56  * call throws an {@link Error}, then it is recommended that processing of the notification
57  * stop at that point, and if it is possible to propagate the {@code Error} to the sender of
58  * the notification, this should be done.&lt;/p&gt;
59  *
60  * &lt;p&gt;This interface should be used by new code in preference to the
61  * {@link NotificationBroadcaster} interface.&lt;/p&gt;
62  *
63  * &lt;p&gt;Implementations of this interface and of {@code NotificationBroadcaster}
64  * should be careful about synchronization.  In particular, it is not a good
65  * idea for an implementation to hold any locks while it is calling a
66  * listener.  To deal with the possibility that the list of listeners might
67  * change while a notification is being dispatched, a good strategy is to
68  * use a {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList} for this list.
69  *
