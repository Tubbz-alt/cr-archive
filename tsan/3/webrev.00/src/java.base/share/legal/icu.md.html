230  #
231  #  A large portion of the dictionary entries
232  #  originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
233  #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
234  #
235  #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
236  #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
237  #  that the provisions of Section 3 (&quot;NO WARRANTY&quot;) will ALWAYS appear
238  #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
239  #  in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
240  #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
241  #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
242  #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
243  #
244  #  NO WARRANTY
245  #
246  #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
247  #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
248  #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
249  #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
250  #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term &quot;warranty&quot; used herein
251  #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
252  #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
253  #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
254  #  any right of any third party.
255  #
256  #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
257  #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
258  #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
259  #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
260  #
261  #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
262  #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
263  #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
264  #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
265  #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
266  #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
267  #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
268  #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
269  #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
270  #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
271  #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
272  #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
273  #  &quot;use&quot; as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
274  #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
275  #  production of secondary products from the program.
276  #
277  #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
278  #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
279  #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
280  #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
281  #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
282  #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
283  #  above as far as the program is concerned.

369 5. Time Zone Database
370 
371   ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
372 Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
373 is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
374 Database section 7.
375 
376  # 7.  Database Ownership
377  #
378  #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
379  #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
380  #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
381  #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
382  #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
383  #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
384  #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
385  #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
386  #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
387  #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
388  #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
389  #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
390  #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.
