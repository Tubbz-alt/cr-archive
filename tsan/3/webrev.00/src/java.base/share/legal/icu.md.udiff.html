<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ Database section 7.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  # 7.  Database Ownership</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  #</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ</span>

<span class="udiff-line-added">+  #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to</span>
