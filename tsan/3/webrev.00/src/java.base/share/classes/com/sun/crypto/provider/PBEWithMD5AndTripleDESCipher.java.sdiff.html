 35  * This class implements a proprietary password-based encryption algorithm.

 38  *
 39  * Here&#39;s how this algorithm works:
 40  *
 41  * 1. Create random salt and split it in two halves. If the two halves are
 42  *    identical, invert one of them.
 43  * 2. Concatenate password with each of the halves.
 44  * 3. Digest each concatenation with c iterations, where c is the
 45  *    iterationCount. Concatenate the output from each digest round with the
 46  *    password, and use the result as the input to the next digest operation.
 47  *    The digest algorithm is MD5.
 48  * 4. After c iterations, use the 2 resulting digests as follows:
