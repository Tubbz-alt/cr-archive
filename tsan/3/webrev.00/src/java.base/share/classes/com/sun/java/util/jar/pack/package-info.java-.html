 26 /**
 27  * This package provides methods to read files from a JAR file and to
 28  * transform them to a more compact transfer format called Pack200.
 29  * It also provides methods to receive the transmitted data and expand
 30  * it into a JAR file equivalent to the original JAR file.
 31  *
 32  * &lt;p&gt;
 33  * The {@code pack} methods may be used by application developers who
 34  * wish to deploy large JARs on the web.  The {@code unpack} methods
 35  * may be used by deployment applications such as Java Web Start and
 36  * Java Plugin.
 37  *
 38  * &lt;p&gt;
 39  * In typical use, the packed output should be further compressed
 40  * using a suitable tool such as gzip or
 41  * {@code java.util.zip.GZIPOutputStream}.  The resulting file (with
 42  * a suffix &quot;.pack.gz&quot;) should be hosted on a HTTP/1.1 compliant
 43  * server, which will be capable of handling &quot;Accept-Encoding&quot;, as
 44  * specified by the HTTP 1.1 RFC2616 specification.
 45  *
 46  * &lt;p&gt;
 47  * &lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; It is recommended that the original &quot;.jar&quot; file be
 48  * hosted in addition to the &quot;.pack.gz&quot; file, so that older client
 49  * implementations will continue to work reliably.  (On-demand
 50  * compression by the server is not recommended.)
 51  *
 52  * &lt;p&gt;
 53  * When a client application requests a &quot;.jar&quot; file (call it
 54  * &quot;Large.jar&quot;), the client will transmit the headers
 55  * &quot;Content-Type=application/x-java-archive&quot; as well as
 56  * &quot;Accept-Encoding=pack200-gzip&quot;.  This indicates to the server that
 57  * the client application desires an version of the file encoded with
 58  * Pack200 and further compressed with gzip.
 59  *
 60  * &lt;p&gt;
 61  * The server implementation will typically check for the existence of
 62  * &quot;Large.pack.gz&quot;.  If that file is available, the server will
 63  * transmit it with the headers &quot;Content-Encoding=pack200-gzip&quot; and
 64  * &quot;Content-Type=application/x-java-archive&quot;.
 65  *
 66  * &lt;p&gt;
 67  * If the &quot;.pack.gz&quot; file, is not available, then the server will
 68  * transmit the original &quot;.jar&quot; with &quot;Content-Encoding=null&quot; and
 69  * &quot;Content-Type=application/x-java-archive&quot;.
 70  *
 71  * &lt;p&gt;
 72  * A MIME type of &quot;application/x-java-pack200&quot; may be specified by the
 73  * client application to indicate a &quot;.pack&quot; file is required.
 74  * However, this has limited capability, and is not recommended.
