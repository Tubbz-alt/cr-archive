 98      * Julian Day field.
 99      * &lt;p&gt;
100      * This is an integer-based version of the Julian Day Number.
101      * Julian Day is a well-known system that represents the count of whole days since day 0,
102      * which is defined to be January 1, 4713 BCE in the Julian calendar, and -4713-11-24 Gregorian.
103      * The field  has &quot;JulianDay&quot; as &#39;name&#39;, and &#39;DAYS&#39; as &#39;baseUnit&#39;.
104      * The field always refers to the local date-time, ignoring the offset or zone.
105      * &lt;p&gt;
106      * For date-times, &#39;JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()&#39; assumes the same value from
107      * midnight until just before the next midnight.
108      * When &#39;JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()&#39; is applied to a date-time, the time of day portion remains unaltered.
109      * &#39;JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()&#39; and &#39;JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()&#39; only apply to {@code Temporal} objects that
110      * can be converted into {@link ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY}.
111      * An {@link UnsupportedTemporalTypeException} is thrown for any other type of object.
112      * &lt;p&gt;
113      * In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a Julian Day field.
114      * In {@linkplain ResolverStyle#STRICT strict mode} and {@linkplain ResolverStyle#SMART smart mode}
115      * the Julian Day value is validated against the range of valid values.
116      * In {@linkplain ResolverStyle#LENIENT lenient mode} no validation occurs.
117      *
<span class="line-modified">118      * &lt;h3&gt;Astronomical and Scientific Notes&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
119      * The standard astronomical definition uses a fraction to indicate the time-of-day,
120      * where each day is counted from midday to midday. For example,
121      * a fraction of 0 represents midday, a fraction of 0.25
122      * represents 18:00, a fraction of 0.5 represents midnight and a fraction
123      * of 0.75 represents 06:00.
124      * &lt;p&gt;
125      * By contrast, this implementation has no fractional part, and counts
126      * days from midnight to midnight.
127      * This implementation uses an integer and days starting at midnight.
128      * The integer value for the Julian Day Number is the astronomical Julian Day value at midday
129      * of the date in question.
130      * This amounts to the astronomical Julian Day, rounded to an integer {@code JDN = floor(JD + 0.5)}.

153      * Modified Julian Day (MJD) is a well-known system that counts days continuously.
154      * It is defined relative to astronomical Julian Day as  {@code MJD = JD - 2400000.5}.
155      * Each Modified Julian Day runs from midnight to midnight.
