 29  * TypeVariable is the common superinterface for type variables of kinds.
 30  * A type variable is created the first time it is needed by a reflective
 31  * method, as specified in this package.  If a type variable t is referenced
 32  * by a type (i.e, class, interface or annotation type) T, and T is declared
 33  * by the nth enclosing class of T (see JLS 8.1.2), then the creation of t
 34  * requires the resolution (see JVMS 5) of the ith enclosing class of T,
 35  * for i = 0 to n, inclusive. Creating a type variable must not cause the
 36  * creation of its bounds. Repeated creation of a type variable has no effect.
 37  *
 38  * &lt;p&gt;Multiple objects may be instantiated at run-time to
 39  * represent a given type variable. Even though a type variable is
 40  * created only once, this does not imply any requirement to cache
 41  * instances representing the type variable. However, all instances
 42  * representing a type variable must be equal() to each other.
 43  * As a consequence, users of type variables must not rely on the identity
 44  * of instances of classes implementing this interface.
 45  *
 46  * @param &lt;D&gt; the type of generic declaration that declared the
 47  * underlying type variable.
