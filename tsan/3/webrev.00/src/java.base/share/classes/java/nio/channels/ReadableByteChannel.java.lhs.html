 66      * &lt;p&gt; A read operation might not fill the buffer, and in fact it might not
 67      * read any bytes at all.  Whether or not it does so depends upon the
 68      * nature and state of the channel.  A socket channel in non-blocking mode,
 69      * for example, cannot read any more bytes than are immediately available
 70      * from the socket&#39;s input buffer; similarly, a file channel cannot read
 71      * any more bytes than remain in the file.  It is guaranteed, however, that
 72      * if a channel is in blocking mode and there is at least one byte
 73      * remaining in the buffer then this method will block until at least one
 74      * byte is read.
 75      *
 76      * &lt;p&gt; This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has
 77      * already initiated a read operation upon this channel, however, then an
 78      * invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
 79      * complete. &lt;/p&gt;
