32  * Indicates that the named compiler warnings should be suppressed in the
33  * annotated element (and in all program elements contained in the annotated
34  * element).  Note that the set of warnings suppressed in a given element is
35  * a superset of the warnings suppressed in all containing elements.  For
36  * example, if you annotate a class to suppress one warning and annotate a
37  * method to suppress another, both warnings will be suppressed in the method.
38  * However, note that if a warning is suppressed in a {@code
39  * module-info} file, the suppression applies to elements within the
40  * file and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to types contained within the module.
41  *
42  * &lt;p&gt;As a matter of style, programmers should always use this annotation
43  * on the most deeply nested element where it is effective.  If you want to
44  * suppress a warning in a particular method, you should annotate that
45  * method rather than its class.
