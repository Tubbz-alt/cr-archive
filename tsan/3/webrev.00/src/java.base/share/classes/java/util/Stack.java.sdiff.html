 29  * The {@code Stack} class represents a last-in-first-out
 30  * (LIFO) stack of objects. It extends class {@code Vector} with five
 31  * operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. The usual
 32  * {@code push} and {@code pop} operations are provided, as well as a
 33  * method to {@code peek} at the top item on the stack, a method to test
 34  * for whether the stack is {@code empty}, and a method to {@code search}
 35  * the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top.
 36  * &lt;p&gt;
 37  * When a stack is first created, it contains no items.
 38  *
 39  * &lt;p&gt;A more complete and consistent set of LIFO stack operations is
 40  * provided by the {@link Deque} interface and its implementations, which
 41  * should be used in preference to this class.  For example:
 42  * &lt;pre&gt;   {@code
 43  *   Deque&lt;Integer&gt; stack = new ArrayDeque&lt;Integer&gt;();}&lt;/pre&gt;
