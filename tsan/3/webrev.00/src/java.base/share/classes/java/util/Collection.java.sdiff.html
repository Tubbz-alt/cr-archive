171  * &lt;p&gt;An &lt;i&gt;unmodifiable view collection&lt;/i&gt; is a collection that is unmodifiable
172  * and that is also a view onto a backing collection. Its mutator methods throw
173  * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}, as described above, while
174  * reading and querying methods are delegated to the backing collection.
175  * The effect is to provide read-only access to the backing collection.
176  * This is useful for a component to provide users with read access to
177  * an internal collection, while preventing them from modifying such
178  * collections unexpectedly. Examples of unmodifiable view collections
179  * are those returned by the
180  * {@link Collections#unmodifiableCollection Collections.unmodifiableCollection},
181  * {@link Collections#unmodifiableList Collections.unmodifiableList}, and
182  * related methods.
183  *
184  * &lt;p&gt;Note that changes to the backing collection might still be possible,
185  * and if they occur, they are visible through the unmodifiable view. Thus,
186  * an unmodifiable view collection is not necessarily immutable. However,
187  * if the backing collection of an unmodifiable view is effectively immutable,
188  * or if the only reference to the backing collection is through an
189  * unmodifiable view, the view can be considered effectively immutable.

<span class="line-added">192  *</span>
<span class="line-added">193  * &lt;p&gt;Serializability of collections is optional. As such, none of the collections</span>
<span class="line-added">194  * interfaces are declared to implement the {@link java.io.Serializable} interface.</span>
<span class="line-added">195  * However, serializability is regarded as being generally useful, so most collection</span>
<span class="line-added">196  * implementations are serializable.</span>
<span class="line-added">197  *</span>
<span class="line-added">198  * &lt;p&gt;The collection implementations that are public classes (such as {@code ArrayList}</span>
<span class="line-added">199  * or {@code HashMap}) are declared to implement the {@code Serializable} interface if they</span>
<span class="line-added">200  * are in fact serializable. Some collections implementations are not public classes,</span>
<span class="line-added">201  * such as the &lt;a href=&quot;#unmodifiable&quot;&gt;unmodifiable collections.&lt;/a&gt; In such cases, the</span>
<span class="line-added">202  * serializability of such collections is described in the specification of the method</span>
<span class="line-added">203  * that creates them, or in some other suitable place. In cases where the serializability</span>
<span class="line-added">204  * of a collection is not specified, there is no guarantee about the serializability of such</span>
<span class="line-added">205  * collections. In particular, many &lt;a href=&quot;#view&quot;&gt;view collections&lt;/a&gt; are not serializable.</span>
<span class="line-added">206  *</span>
<span class="line-added">207  * &lt;p&gt;A collection implementation that implements the {@code Serializable} interface cannot</span>
<span class="line-added">208  * be guaranteed to be serializable. The reason is that in general, collections</span>
<span class="line-added">209  * contain elements of other types, and it is not possible to determine statically</span>
<span class="line-added">210  * whether instances of some element type are actually serializable. For example, consider</span>
<span class="line-added">211  * a serializable {@code Collection&lt;E&gt;}, where {@code E} does not implement the</span>
<span class="line-added">212  * {@code Serializable} interface. The collection may be serializable, if it contains only</span>
<span class="line-added">213  * elements of some serializable subtype of {@code E}, or if it is empty. Collections are</span>
<span class="line-added">214  * thus said to be &lt;i&gt;conditionally serializable,&lt;/i&gt; as the serializability of the collection</span>
<span class="line-added">215  * as a whole depends on whether the collection itself is serializable and on whether all</span>
<span class="line-added">216  * contained elements are also serializable.</span>
<span class="line-added">217  *</span>
<span class="line-added">218  * &lt;p&gt;An additional case occurs with instances of {@link SortedSet} and {@link SortedMap}.</span>
<span class="line-added">219  * These collections can be created with a {@link Comparator} that imposes an ordering on</span>
<span class="line-added">220  * the set elements or map keys. Such a collection is serializable only if the provided</span>
<span class="line-added">221  * {@code Comparator} is also serializable.</span>
