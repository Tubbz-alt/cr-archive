31  * An informative annotation type used to indicate that an interface
32  * type declaration is intended to be a &lt;i&gt;functional interface&lt;/i&gt; as
33  * defined by the Java Language Specification.
34  *
35  * Conceptually, a functional interface has exactly one abstract
36  * method.  Since {@linkplain java.lang.reflect.Method#isDefault()
37  * default methods} have an implementation, they are not abstract.  If
38  * an interface declares an abstract method overriding one of the
39  * public methods of {@code java.lang.Object}, that also does
40  * &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; count toward the interface&#39;s abstract method count
41  * since any implementation of the interface will have an
42  * implementation from {@code java.lang.Object} or elsewhere.
43  *
44  * &lt;p&gt;Note that instances of functional interfaces can be created with
45  * lambda expressions, method references, or constructor references.
46  *
47  * &lt;p&gt;If a type is annotated with this annotation type, compilers are
48  * required to generate an error message unless:
49  *
50  * &lt;ul&gt;
51  * &lt;li&gt; The type is an interface type and not an annotation type, enum, or class.
52  * &lt;li&gt; The annotated type satisfies the requirements of a functional interface.
53  * &lt;/ul&gt;
54  *
55  * &lt;p&gt;However, the compiler will treat any interface meeting the
56  * definition of a functional interface as a functional interface
57  * regardless of whether or not a {@code FunctionalInterface}
58  * annotation is present on the interface declaration.
