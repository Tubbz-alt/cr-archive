 34  * A {@code CertPathBuilderException} provides support for wrapping
 35  * exceptions. The {@link #getCause getCause} method returns the throwable,
 36  * if any, that caused this exception to be thrown.

 42  * object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
 43  * provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
 44  * separate objects need not synchronize.
