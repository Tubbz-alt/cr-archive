 53  * &lt;p&gt; In addition to groups created explicitly, the Java virtual machine
 54  * maintains a system-wide &lt;em&gt;default group&lt;/em&gt; that is constructed
 55  * automatically. Asynchronous channels that do not specify a group at
 56  * construction time are bound to the default group. The default group has an
 57  * associated thread pool that creates new threads as needed. The default group
 58  * may be configured by means of system properties defined in the table below.
 59  * Where the {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory ThreadFactory} for the
 60  * default group is not configured then the pooled threads of the default group
 61  * are {@link Thread#isDaemon daemon} threads.
