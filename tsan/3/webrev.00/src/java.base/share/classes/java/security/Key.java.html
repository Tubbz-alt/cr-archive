 29  * The Key interface is the top-level interface for all keys. It
 30  * defines the functionality shared by all key objects. All keys
 31  * have three characteristics:
 32  *
 33  * &lt;UL&gt;
 34  *
 35  * &lt;LI&gt;An Algorithm
 36  *
 37  * &lt;P&gt;This is the key algorithm for that key. The key algorithm is usually
 38  * an encryption or asymmetric operation algorithm (such as DSA or
 39  * RSA), which will work with those algorithms and with related
 40  * algorithms (such as MD5 with RSA, SHA-1 with RSA, Raw DSA, etc.)
 41  * The name of the algorithm of a key is obtained using the
 42  * {@link #getAlgorithm() getAlgorithm} method.
 43  *
 44  * &lt;LI&gt;An Encoded Form
 45  *
 46  * &lt;P&gt;This is an external encoded form for the key used when a standard
 47  * representation of the key is needed outside the Java Virtual Machine,
 48  * as when transmitting the key to some other party. The key
 49  * is encoded according to a standard format (such as
 50  * X.509 {@code SubjectPublicKeyInfo} or PKCS#8), and
 51  * is returned using the {@link #getEncoded() getEncoded} method.
 52  * Note: The syntax of the ASN.1 type {@code SubjectPublicKeyInfo}
 53  * is defined as follows:
 54  *
 55  * &lt;pre&gt;
 56  * SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
 57  *   algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
 58  *   subjectPublicKey BIT STRING }
 59  *
 60  * AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
 61  *   algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
 62  *   parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL }
 63  * &lt;/pre&gt;
 64  *
 65  * For more information, see
 66  * &lt;a href=&quot;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280&quot;&gt;RFC 5280:
 67  * Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile&lt;/a&gt;.
 68  *
 69  * &lt;LI&gt;A Format
 70  *
 71  * &lt;P&gt;This is the name of the format of the encoded key. It is returned
 72  * by the {@link #getFormat() getFormat} method.
 73  *
 74  * &lt;/UL&gt;
 75  *
 76  * Keys are generally obtained through key generators, certificates,
 77  * key stores or other classes used to manage keys.
 78  * Keys may also be obtained from key specifications (transparent
 79  * representations of the underlying key material) through the use of a key
 80  * factory (see {@link KeyFactory}).
 81  *
 82  * &lt;p&gt; A Key should use KeyRep as its serialized representation.
 83  * Note that a serialized Key may contain sensitive information
 84  * which should not be exposed in untrusted environments.  See the
 85  * &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/../specs/serialization/security.html&quot;&gt;
 86  * Security Appendix&lt;/a&gt;
 87  * of the Serialization Specification for more information.
