 27  * Defines interfaces and classes for the Java virtual machine to access files,
 28  * file attributes, and file systems.
 29  *
 30  * &lt;p&gt; The java.nio.file package defines classes to access files and file
 31  * systems. The API to access file and file system attributes is defined in the
 32  * {@link java.nio.file.attribute} package. The {@link java.nio.file.spi}
 33  * package is used by service provider implementors wishing to extend the
 34  * platform default provider, or to construct other provider implementations. &lt;/p&gt;
 35  *
 36  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;links&quot;&gt;Symbolic Links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified"> 37  * &lt;p&gt; Many operating systems and file systems have support for &lt;em&gt;symbolic links&lt;/em&gt;.</span>
 38  * A symbolic link is a special file that serves as a reference to another file.
 39  * For the most part, symbolic links are transparent to applications and
 40  * operations on symbolic links are automatically redirected to the &lt;em&gt;target&lt;/em&gt;
 41  * of the link. Exceptions to this are when a symbolic link is deleted or
 42  * renamed/moved in which case the link is deleted or removed rather than the
 43  * target of the link. This package includes support for symbolic links where
 44  * implementations provide these semantics. File systems may support other types
 45  * that are semantically close but support for these other types of links is
 46  * not included in this package. &lt;/p&gt;
 47  *
 48  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;interop&quot;&gt;Interoperability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 49  * &lt;p&gt; The {@link java.io.File} class defines the {@link java.io.File#toPath
 50  * toPath} method to construct a {@link java.nio.file.Path} by converting
 51  * the abstract path represented by the {@code java.io.File} object. The resulting
 52  * {@code Path} can be used to operate on the same file as the {@code File}
 53  * object. The {@code Path} specification provides further information
 54  * on the &lt;a href=&quot;Path.html#interop&quot;&gt;interoperability&lt;/a&gt; between {@code Path}
 55  * and {@code java.io.File} objects. &lt;/p&gt;
 56  *
 57  * &lt;h2&gt;Visibility&lt;/h2&gt;
 58  * &lt;p&gt; The view of the files and file system provided by classes in this package are
 59  * guaranteed to be consistent with other views provided by other instances in the
 60  * same Java virtual machine.  The view may or may not, however, be consistent with
 61  * the view of the file system as seen by other concurrently running programs due
 62  * to caching performed by the underlying operating system and delays induced by
 63  * network-filesystem protocols. This is true regardless of the language in which
 64  * these other programs are written, and whether they are running on the same machine
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a><span class="line-modified"> 65  * or on some other machine.  The exact nature of any such inconsistencies is</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 66  * system-dependent and therefore unspecified. &lt;/p&gt;</span>
 67  *
 68  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;integrity&quot;&gt;Synchronized I/O File Integrity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 69  * &lt;p&gt; The {@link java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption#SYNC SYNC} and {@link
 70  * java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption#DSYNC DSYNC} options are used when opening a file
 71  * to require that updates to the file are written synchronously to the underlying
 72  * storage device. In the case of the default provider, and the file resides on
 73  * a local storage device, and the {@link java.nio.channels.SeekableByteChannel
 74  * seekable} channel is connected to a file that was opened with one of these
 75  * options, then an invocation of the {@link
 76  * java.nio.channels.WritableByteChannel#write(java.nio.ByteBuffer) write}
 77  * method is only guaranteed to return when all changes made to the file
 78  * by that invocation have been written to the device. These options are useful
 79  * for ensuring that critical information is not lost in the event of a system
 80  * crash. If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee
 81  * is made. Whether this guarantee is possible with other {@link
 82  * java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider provider} implementations is provider
 83  * specific. &lt;/p&gt;
 84  *
 85  * &lt;h2&gt;General Exceptions&lt;/h2&gt;
 86  * &lt;p&gt; Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 87  * or method of any class or interface in this package will cause a {@link
 88  * java.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown. Additionally,
 89  * invoking a method with an array or collection containing a {@code null} element
 90  * will cause a {@code NullPointerException}, unless otherwise specified. &lt;/p&gt;
 91  *
 92  * &lt;p&gt; Unless otherwise noted, methods that attempt to access the file system
 93  * will throw {@link java.nio.file.ClosedFileSystemException} when invoked on
 94  * objects associated with a {@link java.nio.file.FileSystem} that has been
 95  * {@link java.nio.file.FileSystem#close closed}. Additionally, any methods
 96  * that attempt write access to a file system will throw {@link
 97  * java.nio.file.ReadOnlyFileSystemException} when invoked on an object associated
 98  * with a {@link java.nio.file.FileSystem} that only provides read-only
 99  * access. &lt;/p&gt;
100  *
101  * &lt;p&gt; Unless otherwise noted, invoking a method of any class or interface in
102  * this package created by one {@link java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider
103  * provider} with a parameter that is an object created by another provider,
104  * will throw {@link java.nio.file.ProviderMismatchException}. &lt;/p&gt;
105  *
106  * &lt;h2&gt;Optional Specific Exceptions&lt;/h2&gt;
107  * Most of the methods defined by classes in this package that access the
108  * file system specify that {@link java.io.IOException} be thrown when an I/O
109  * error occurs. In some cases, these methods define specific I/O exceptions
110  * for common cases. These exceptions, noted as &lt;i&gt;optional specific exceptions&lt;/i&gt;,
111  * are thrown by the implementation where it can detect the specific error.
112  * Where the specific error cannot be detected then the more general {@code
113  * IOException} is thrown.
114  *
