 43  * A reentrant mutual exclusion {@link Lock} with the same basic
 44  * behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using
 45  * {@code synchronized} methods and statements, but with extended
 46  * capabilities.
 47  *
 48  * &lt;p&gt;A {@code ReentrantLock} is &lt;em&gt;owned&lt;/em&gt; by the thread last
 49  * successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking
 50  * {@code lock} will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when
 51  * the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return
 52  * immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can
 53  * be checked using methods {@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}, and {@link
 54  * #getHoldCount}.
 55  *
 56  * &lt;p&gt;The constructor for this class accepts an optional
 57  * &lt;em&gt;fairness&lt;/em&gt; parameter.  When set {@code true}, under
 58  * contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
 59  * thread.  Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular
 60  * access order.  Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads
 61  * may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much
 62  * slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller
 63  * variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of
 64  * starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee
 65  * fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a
 66  * fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other
 67  * active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the
 68  * lock.
 69  * Also note that the untimed {@link #tryLock()} method does not
 70  * honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
 71  * is available even if other threads are waiting.
 72  *
 73  * &lt;p&gt;It is recommended practice to &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; immediately
 74  * follow a call to {@code lock} with a {@code try} block, most
 75  * typically in a before/after construction such as:
 76  *
 77  * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 78  * class X {
 79  *   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
 80  *   // ...
 81  *
 82  *   public void m() {
 83  *     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
 84  *     try {
 85  *       // ... method body
 86  *     } finally {
 87  *       lock.unlock()
 88  *     }
 89  *   }
 90  * }}&lt;/pre&gt;
 91  *
 92  * &lt;p&gt;In addition to implementing the {@link Lock} interface, this
 93  * class defines a number of {@code public} and {@code protected}
 94  * methods for inspecting the state of the lock.  Some of these
 95  * methods are only useful for instrumentation and monitoring.
 96  *
 97  * &lt;p&gt;Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 98  * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 99  * its state when serialized.
100  *
101  * &lt;p&gt;This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive locks by
102  * the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in
103  * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
