 89  * Fields and units specific to the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 90  * including quarter-of-year and week-based-year.
 91  * &lt;p&gt;
 92  * This class defines fields and units that are specific to the ISO calendar system.
 93  *
<span class="line-modified"> 94  * &lt;h3&gt;Quarter of year&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
 95  * The ISO-8601 standard is based on the standard civic 12 month year.
 96  * This is commonly divided into four quarters, often abbreviated as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.
 97  * &lt;p&gt;
 98  * January, February and March are in Q1.
 99  * April, May and June are in Q2.
100  * July, August and September are in Q3.
101  * October, November and December are in Q4.
102  * &lt;p&gt;
103  * The complete date is expressed using three fields:
104  * &lt;ul&gt;
105  * &lt;li&gt;{@link #DAY_OF_QUARTER DAY_OF_QUARTER} - the day within the quarter, from 1 to 90, 91 or 92
106  * &lt;li&gt;{@link #QUARTER_OF_YEAR QUARTER_OF_YEAR} - the quarter within the year, from 1 to 4
107  * &lt;li&gt;{@link ChronoField#YEAR YEAR} - the standard ISO year
108  * &lt;/ul&gt;
109  *
<span class="line-modified">110  * &lt;h3&gt;Week based years&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
111  * The ISO-8601 standard was originally intended as a data interchange format,
112  * defining a string format for dates and times. However, it also defines an
113  * alternate way of expressing the date, based on the concept of week-based-year.
114  * &lt;p&gt;
115  * The date is expressed using three fields:
116  * &lt;ul&gt;
117  * &lt;li&gt;{@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK DAY_OF_WEEK} - the standard field defining the
118  *  day-of-week from Monday (1) to Sunday (7)
119  * &lt;li&gt;{@link #WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week within the week-based-year
120  * &lt;li&gt;{@link #WEEK_BASED_YEAR WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week-based-year
121  * &lt;/ul&gt;
122  * The week-based-year itself is defined relative to the standard ISO proleptic year.
123  * It differs from the standard year in that it always starts on a Monday.
124  * &lt;p&gt;
125  * The first week of a week-based-year is the first Monday-based week of the standard
126  * ISO year that has at least 4 days in the new year.
127  * &lt;ul&gt;
128  * &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Monday then week 1 starts on January 1st
129  * &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Tuesday then week 1 starts on December 31st of the previous standard year
130  * &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Wednesday then week 1 starts on December 30th of the previous standard year
