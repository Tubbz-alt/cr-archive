 33 /**
 34  * This class is for security permissions. A {@code SecurityPermission}
 35  * contains a name (also referred to as a &quot;target name&quot;) but no actions list;
 36  * you either have the named permission or you don&#39;t.
 37  * &lt;p&gt;
 38  * The target name is the name of a security configuration parameter
 39  * (see below). Currently the {@code SecurityPermission} object is used to
 40  * guard access to the {@link AccessControlContext}, {@link Policy},
 41  * {@link Provider}, {@link Security}, {@link Signer}, and {@link Identity}
 42  * objects.
 43  * &lt;p&gt;
 44  * The following table lists the standard {@code SecurityPermission}
 45  * target names, and for each provides a description of what the permission
 46  * allows and a discussion of the risks of granting code the permission.
 47  *
 48  * &lt;table class=&quot;striped&quot;&gt;
 49  * &lt;caption style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;target name, what the permission allows, and associated risks&lt;/caption&gt;
 50  * &lt;thead&gt;
 51  * &lt;tr&gt;
 52  * &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Permission Target Name&lt;/th&gt;
 53  * &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;What the Permission Allows&lt;/th&gt;
 54  * &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Risks of Allowing this Permission&lt;/th&gt;
 55  * &lt;/tr&gt;
 56  * &lt;/thead&gt;
 57  * &lt;tbody&gt;
 58  *
 59  * &lt;tr&gt;
 60  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;authProvider.{provider name}&lt;/th&gt;
 61  *   &lt;td&gt;Allow the named provider to be an AuthProvider for login and
 62  * logout operations. &lt;/td&gt;
 63  *   &lt;td&gt;This allows the named provider to perform login and logout
 64  * operations. The named provider must extend {@code AuthProvider}
 65  * and care must be taken to grant to a trusted provider since
 66  * login operations involve sensitive authentication information
 67  * such as PINs and passwords. &lt;/td&gt;
 68  * &lt;/tr&gt;
 69  *
 70  * &lt;tr&gt;
 71  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;createAccessControlContext&lt;/th&gt;
 72  *   &lt;td&gt;Creation of an AccessControlContext&lt;/td&gt;
 73  *   &lt;td&gt;This allows someone to instantiate an AccessControlContext
 74  * with a {@code DomainCombiner}.  Extreme care must be taken when
 75  * granting this permission. Malicious code could create a DomainCombiner
 76  * that augments the set of permissions granted to code, and even grant the
 77  * code {@link java.security.AllPermission}.&lt;/td&gt;
 78  * &lt;/tr&gt;
 79  *
 80  * &lt;tr&gt;
 81  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;getDomainCombiner&lt;/th&gt;
 82  *   &lt;td&gt;Retrieval of an AccessControlContext&#39;s DomainCombiner&lt;/td&gt;
 83  *   &lt;td&gt;This allows someone to retrieve an AccessControlContext&#39;s
 84  * {@code DomainCombiner}.  Since DomainCombiners may contain
 85  * sensitive information, this could potentially lead to a privacy leak.&lt;/td&gt;
 86  * &lt;/tr&gt;
 87  *
 88  * &lt;tr&gt;
 89  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;getPolicy&lt;/th&gt;
 90  *   &lt;td&gt;Retrieval of the system-wide security policy (specifically, of the
 91  * currently-installed Policy object)&lt;/td&gt;
 92  *   &lt;td&gt;This allows someone to query the policy via the
 93  * {@code getPermissions} call,
 94  * which discloses which permissions would be granted to a given CodeSource.
 95  * While revealing the policy does not compromise the security of
 96  * the system, it does provide malicious code with additional information
 97  * which it may use to better aim an attack. It is wise
 98  * not to divulge more information than necessary.&lt;/td&gt;
 99  * &lt;/tr&gt;
100  *
101  * &lt;tr&gt;
102  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;setPolicy&lt;/th&gt;
103  *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of the system-wide security policy (specifically,
104  * the Policy object)&lt;/td&gt;
105  *   &lt;td&gt;Granting this permission is extremely dangerous, as malicious
106  * code may grant itself all the necessary permissions it needs
107  * to successfully mount an attack on the system.&lt;/td&gt;
108  * &lt;/tr&gt;
109  *
110  * &lt;tr&gt;
111  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;createPolicy.{policy type}&lt;/th&gt;
112  *   &lt;td&gt;Getting an instance of a Policy implementation from a provider&lt;/td&gt;
113  *   &lt;td&gt;Granting this permission enables code to obtain a Policy object.
114  * Malicious code may query the Policy object to determine what permissions
115  * have been granted to code other than itself. &lt;/td&gt;
116  * &lt;/tr&gt;
117  *
118  * &lt;tr&gt;
119  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;getProperty.{key}&lt;/th&gt;
120  *   &lt;td&gt;Retrieval of the security property with the specified key&lt;/td&gt;
121  *   &lt;td&gt;Depending on the particular key for which access has
122  * been granted, the code may have access to the list of security
123  * providers, as well as the location of the system-wide and user
124  * security policies.  while revealing this information does not
125  * compromise the security of the system, it does provide malicious
126  * code with additional information which it may use to better aim
127  * an attack.
128 &lt;/td&gt;
129  * &lt;/tr&gt;
130  *
131  * &lt;tr&gt;
132  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;setProperty.{key}&lt;/th&gt;
133  *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of the security property with the specified key&lt;/td&gt;
134  *   &lt;td&gt;This could include setting a security provider or defining
135  * the location of the system-wide security policy.  Malicious
136  * code that has permission to set a new security provider may
137  * set a rogue provider that steals confidential information such
138  * as cryptographic private keys. In addition, malicious code with
139  * permission to set the location of the system-wide security policy
140  * may point it to a security policy that grants the attacker
141  * all the necessary permissions it requires to successfully mount
142  * an attack on the system.
143 &lt;/td&gt;
144  * &lt;/tr&gt;
145  *
146  * &lt;tr&gt;
147  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;insertProvider&lt;/th&gt;
148  *   &lt;td&gt;Addition of a new provider&lt;/td&gt;
149  *   &lt;td&gt;This would allow somebody to introduce a possibly
150  * malicious provider (e.g., one that discloses the private keys passed
151  * to it) as the highest-priority provider. This would be possible
152  * because the Security object (which manages the installed providers)
153  * currently does not check the integrity or authenticity of a provider
154  * before attaching it. The &quot;insertProvider&quot; permission subsumes the
155  * &quot;insertProvider.{provider name}&quot; permission (see the section below for
156  * more information).
157  * &lt;/td&gt;
158  * &lt;/tr&gt;
159  *
160  * &lt;tr&gt;
161  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;removeProvider.{provider name}&lt;/th&gt;
162  *   &lt;td&gt;Removal of the specified provider&lt;/td&gt;
163  *   &lt;td&gt;This may change the behavior or disable execution of other
164  * parts of the program. If a provider subsequently requested by the
165  * program has been removed, execution may fail. Also, if the removed
166  * provider is not explicitly requested by the rest of the program, but
167  * it would normally be the provider chosen when a cryptography service
168  * is requested (due to its previous order in the list of providers),
169  * a different provider will be chosen instead, or no suitable provider
170  * will be found, thereby resulting in program failure.&lt;/td&gt;
171  * &lt;/tr&gt;
172  *
173  * &lt;tr&gt;
174  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;clearProviderProperties.{provider name}&lt;/th&gt;
175  *   &lt;td&gt;&quot;Clearing&quot; of a Provider so that it no longer contains the properties
176  * used to look up services implemented by the provider&lt;/td&gt;
177  *   &lt;td&gt;This disables the lookup of services implemented by the provider.
178  * This may thus change the behavior or disable execution of other
179  * parts of the program that would normally utilize the Provider, as
180  * described under the &quot;removeProvider.{provider name}&quot; permission.&lt;/td&gt;
181  * &lt;/tr&gt;
182  *
183  * &lt;tr&gt;
184  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;putProviderProperty.{provider name}&lt;/th&gt;
185  *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of properties for the specified Provider&lt;/td&gt;
186  *   &lt;td&gt;The provider properties each specify the name and location
187  * of a particular service implemented by the provider. By granting
188  * this permission, you let code replace the service specification
189  * with another one, thereby specifying a different implementation.&lt;/td&gt;
190  * &lt;/tr&gt;
191  *
192  * &lt;tr&gt;
193  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;removeProviderProperty.{provider name}&lt;/th&gt;
194  *   &lt;td&gt;Removal of properties from the specified Provider&lt;/td&gt;
195  *   &lt;td&gt;This disables the lookup of services implemented by the
196  * provider. They are no longer accessible due to removal of the properties
197  * specifying their names and locations. This
198  * may change the behavior or disable execution of other
199  * parts of the program that would normally utilize the Provider, as
200  * described under the &quot;removeProvider.{provider name}&quot; permission.&lt;/td&gt;
201  * &lt;/tr&gt;
202  *
203  * &lt;/tbody&gt;
204  * &lt;/table&gt;
205  *
206  * &lt;P&gt;
207  * The following permissions have been superseded by newer permissions or are
208  * associated with classes that have been deprecated: {@link Identity},
209  * {@link IdentityScope}, {@link Signer}. Use of them is discouraged. See the
210  * applicable classes for more information.
211  *
212  * &lt;table class=&quot;striped&quot;&gt;
213  * &lt;caption style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;target name, what the permission allows, and associated risks&lt;/caption&gt;
214  * &lt;thead&gt;
215  * &lt;tr&gt;
216  * &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Permission Target Name&lt;/th&gt;
217  * &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;What the Permission Allows&lt;/th&gt;
218  * &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Risks of Allowing this Permission&lt;/th&gt;
219  * &lt;/tr&gt;
220  * &lt;/thead&gt;
221  *
222  * &lt;tbody&gt;
223  * &lt;tr&gt;
224  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;insertProvider.{provider name}&lt;/th&gt;
225  *   &lt;td&gt;Addition of a new provider, with the specified name&lt;/td&gt;
226  *   &lt;td&gt;Use of this permission is discouraged from further use because it is
227  * possible to circumvent the name restrictions by overriding the
228  * {@link java.security.Provider#getName} method. Also, there is an equivalent
229  * level of risk associated with granting code permission to insert a provider
230  * with a specific name, or any name it chooses. Users should use the
231  * &quot;insertProvider&quot; permission instead.
232  * &lt;p&gt;This would allow somebody to introduce a possibly
233  * malicious provider (e.g., one that discloses the private keys passed
234  * to it) as the highest-priority provider. This would be possible
235  * because the Security object (which manages the installed providers)
236  * currently does not check the integrity or authenticity of a provider
237  * before attaching it.&lt;/td&gt;
238  * &lt;/tr&gt;
239  *
240  * &lt;tr&gt;
241  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;setSystemScope&lt;/th&gt;
242  *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of the system identity scope&lt;/td&gt;
243  *   &lt;td&gt;This would allow an attacker to configure the system identity scope with
244  * certificates that should not be trusted, thereby granting applet or
245  * application code signed with those certificates privileges that
246  * would have been denied by the system&#39;s original identity scope.&lt;/td&gt;
247  * &lt;/tr&gt;
248  *
249  * &lt;tr&gt;
250  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;setIdentityPublicKey&lt;/th&gt;
251  *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of the public key for an Identity&lt;/td&gt;
252  *   &lt;td&gt;If the identity is marked as &quot;trusted&quot;, this allows an attacker to
253  * introduce a different public key (e.g., its own) that is not trusted
254  * by the system&#39;s identity scope, thereby granting applet or
255  * application code signed with that public key privileges that
256  * would have been denied otherwise.&lt;/td&gt;
257  * &lt;/tr&gt;
258  *
259  * &lt;tr&gt;
260  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;setIdentityInfo&lt;/th&gt;
261  *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of a general information string for an Identity&lt;/td&gt;
262  *   &lt;td&gt;This allows attackers to set the general description for
263  * an identity.  This may trick applications into using a different
264  * identity than intended or may prevent applications from finding a
265  * particular identity.&lt;/td&gt;
266  * &lt;/tr&gt;
267  *
268  * &lt;tr&gt;
269  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;addIdentityCertificate&lt;/th&gt;
270  *   &lt;td&gt;Addition of a certificate for an Identity&lt;/td&gt;
271  *   &lt;td&gt;This allows attackers to set a certificate for
272  * an identity&#39;s public key.  This is dangerous because it affects
273  * the trust relationship across the system. This public key suddenly
274  * becomes trusted to a wider audience than it otherwise would be.&lt;/td&gt;
275  * &lt;/tr&gt;
276  *
277  * &lt;tr&gt;
278  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;removeIdentityCertificate&lt;/th&gt;
279  *   &lt;td&gt;Removal of a certificate for an Identity&lt;/td&gt;
280  *   &lt;td&gt;This allows attackers to remove a certificate for
281  * an identity&#39;s public key. This is dangerous because it affects
282  * the trust relationship across the system. This public key suddenly
283  * becomes considered less trustworthy than it otherwise would be.&lt;/td&gt;
284  * &lt;/tr&gt;
285  *
286  * &lt;tr&gt;
287  *  &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;printIdentity&lt;/th&gt;
288  *  &lt;td&gt;Viewing the name of a principal
289  * and optionally the scope in which it is used, and whether
290  * or not it is considered &quot;trusted&quot; in that scope&lt;/td&gt;
291  *  &lt;td&gt;The scope that is printed out may be a filename, in which case
292  * it may convey local system information. For example, here&#39;s a sample
293  * printout of an identity named &quot;carol&quot;, who is
294  * marked not trusted in the user&#39;s identity database:&lt;br&gt;
295  *   carol[/home/luehe/identitydb.obj][not trusted]&lt;/td&gt;
296  *&lt;/tr&gt;
297  *
298  * &lt;tr&gt;
299  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;getSignerPrivateKey&lt;/th&gt;
300  *   &lt;td&gt;Retrieval of a Signer&#39;s private key&lt;/td&gt;
301  *   &lt;td&gt;It is very dangerous to allow access to a private key; private
302  * keys are supposed to be kept secret. Otherwise, code can use the
303  * private key to sign various files and claim the signature came from
304  * the Signer.&lt;/td&gt;
305  * &lt;/tr&gt;
306  *
307  * &lt;tr&gt;
308  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;setSignerKeyPair&lt;/th&gt;
309  *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of the key pair (public key and private key) for a Signer&lt;/td&gt;
310  *   &lt;td&gt;This would allow an attacker to replace somebody else&#39;s (the &quot;target&#39;s&quot;)
311  * keypair with a possibly weaker keypair (e.g., a keypair of a smaller
312  * keysize).  This also would allow the attacker to listen in on encrypted
313  * communication between the target and its peers. The target&#39;s peers
314  * might wrap an encryption session key under the target&#39;s &quot;new&quot; public
315  * key, which would allow the attacker (who possesses the corresponding
316  * private key) to unwrap the session key and decipher the communication
317  * data encrypted under that session key.&lt;/td&gt;
318  * &lt;/tr&gt;
319  *
320  * &lt;/tbody&gt;
321  * &lt;/table&gt;
322  *
323  * @implNote
324  * Implementations may define additional target names, but should use naming
325  * conventions such as reverse domain name notation to avoid name clashes.
