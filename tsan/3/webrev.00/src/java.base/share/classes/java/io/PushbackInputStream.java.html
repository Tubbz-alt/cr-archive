 28 /**
 29  * A {@code PushbackInputStream} adds
 30  * functionality to another input stream, namely
 31  * the  ability to &quot;push back&quot; or &quot;unread&quot; bytes,
 32  * by storing pushed-back bytes in an internal buffer.
 33  * This is useful in situations where
 34  * it is convenient for a fragment of code
 35  * to read an indefinite number of data bytes
 36  * that  are delimited by a particular byte
 37  * value; after reading the terminating byte,
 38  * the  code fragment can &quot;unread&quot; it, so that
 39  * the next read operation on the input stream
 40  * will reread the byte that was pushed back.
 41  * For example, bytes representing the  characters
 42  * constituting an identifier might be terminated
 43  * by a byte representing an  operator character;
 44  * a method whose job is to read just an identifier
 45  * can read until it  sees the operator and
 46  * then push the operator back to be re-read.
