 35  * Thrown by a method invocation on a proxy instance if its invocation
 36  * handler&#39;s {@link InvocationHandler#invoke invoke} method throws a
 37  * checked exception (a {@code Throwable} that is not assignable
 38  * to {@code RuntimeException} or {@code Error}) that
 39  * is not assignable to any of the exception types declared in the
 40  * {@code throws} clause of the method that was invoked on the
 41  * proxy instance and dispatched to the invocation handler.
 42  *
 43  * &lt;p&gt;An {@code UndeclaredThrowableException} instance contains
 44  * the undeclared checked exception that was thrown by the invocation
 45  * handler, and it can be retrieved with the
 46  * {@code getUndeclaredThrowable()} method.
 47  * {@code UndeclaredThrowableException} extends
 48  * {@code RuntimeException}, so it is an unchecked exception
 49  * that wraps a checked exception.
 50  *
 51  * &lt;p&gt;As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to
 52  * conform to the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The
 53  * &quot;undeclared checked exception that was thrown by the invocation
 54  * handler&quot; that may be provided at construction time and accessed via
 55  * the {@link #getUndeclaredThrowable()} method is now known as the
 56  * &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt;, and may be accessed via the {@link
 57  * Throwable#getCause()} method, as well as the aforementioned &quot;legacy
 58  * method.&quot;
