 31  * A piped output stream can be connected to a piped input stream
 32  * to create a communications pipe. The piped output stream is the
 33  * sending end of the pipe. Typically, data is written to a
 34  * {@code PipedOutputStream} object by one thread and data is
 35  * read from the connected {@code PipedInputStream} by some
 36  * other thread. Attempting to use both objects from a single thread
 37  * is not recommended as it may deadlock the thread.
 38  * The pipe is said to be &lt;a id=BROKEN&gt; &lt;i&gt;broken&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/a&gt; if a
 39  * thread that was reading data bytes from the connected piped input
 40  * stream is no longer alive.
