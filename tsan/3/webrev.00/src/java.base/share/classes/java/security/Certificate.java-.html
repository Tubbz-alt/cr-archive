 32  * &lt;p&gt;This is an interface of abstract methods for managing a
 33  * variety of identity certificates.
 34  * An identity certificate is a guarantee by a principal that
 35  * a public key is that of another principal.  (A principal represents
 36  * an entity such as an individual user, a group, or a corporation.)
 37  *
 38  * &lt;p&gt;In particular, this interface is intended to be a common
 39  * abstraction for constructs that have different formats but
 40  * important common uses.  For example, different types of
 41  * certificates, such as X.509 certificates and PGP certificates,
 42  * share general certificate functionality (the need to encode and
 43  * decode certificates) and some types of information, such as a
 44  * public key, the principal whose key it is, and the guarantor
 45  * guaranteeing that the public key is that of the specified
 46  * principal. So an implementation of X.509 certificates and an
 47  * implementation of PGP certificates can both utilize the Certificate
 48  * interface, even though their formats and additional types and
 49  * amounts of information stored are different.
 50  *
 51  * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important&lt;/b&gt;: This interface is useful for cataloging and
 52  * grouping objects sharing certain common uses. It does not have any
 53  * semantics of its own. In particular, a Certificate object does not
 54  * make any statement as to the &lt;i&gt;validity&lt;/i&gt; of the binding. It is
 55  * the duty of the application implementing this interface to verify
 56  * the certificate and satisfy itself of its validity.
