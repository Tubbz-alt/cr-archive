29  * Thrown to indicate that code has attempted to call a method handle
30  * via the wrong method type.  As with the bytecode representation of
31  * normal Java method calls, method handle calls are strongly typed
32  * to a specific type descriptor associated with a call site.
33  * &lt;p&gt;
34  * This exception may also be thrown when two method handles are
35  * composed, and the system detects that their types cannot be
36  * matched up correctly.  This amounts to an early evaluation
37  * of the type mismatch, at method handle construction time,
38  * instead of when the mismatched method handle is called.
