 29  * The constants of this enumerated type provide a simple classification of the
 30  * syntactic locations where annotations may appear in a Java program. These
 31  * constants are used in {@link java.lang.annotation.Target Target}
 32  * meta-annotations to specify where it is legal to write annotations of a
 33  * given type.
 34  *
 35  * &lt;p&gt;The syntactic locations where annotations may appear are split into
 36  * &lt;em&gt;declaration contexts&lt;/em&gt; , where annotations apply to declarations, and
 37  * &lt;em&gt;type contexts&lt;/em&gt; , where annotations apply to types used in
 38  * declarations and expressions.
 39  *
 40  * &lt;p&gt;The constants {@link #ANNOTATION_TYPE}, {@link #CONSTRUCTOR}, {@link
 41  * #FIELD}, {@link #LOCAL_VARIABLE}, {@link #METHOD}, {@link #PACKAGE}, {@link
 42  * #MODULE}, {@link #PARAMETER}, {@link #TYPE}, and {@link #TYPE_PARAMETER}
 43  * correspond to the declaration contexts in JLS 9.6.4.1.
 44  *
 45  * &lt;p&gt;For example, an annotation whose type is meta-annotated with
 46  * {@code @Target(ElementType.FIELD)} may only be written as a modifier for a
 47  * field declaration.
 48  *
 49  * &lt;p&gt;The constant {@link #TYPE_USE} corresponds to the type contexts in JLS
 50  * 4.11, as well as to two declaration contexts: type declarations (including
 51  * annotation type declarations) and type parameter declarations.
 52  *
 53  * &lt;p&gt;For example, an annotation whose type is meta-annotated with
 54  * {@code @Target(ElementType.TYPE_USE)} may be written on the type of a field
 55  * (or within the type of the field, if it is a nested, parameterized, or array
 56  * type), and may also appear as a modifier for, say, a class declaration.
 57  *
 58  * &lt;p&gt;The {@code TYPE_USE} constant includes type declarations and type
 59  * parameter declarations as a convenience for designers of type checkers which
 60  * give semantics to annotation types. For example, if the annotation type
 61  * {@code NonNull} is meta-annotated with
 62  * {@code @Target(ElementType.TYPE_USE)}, then {@code @NonNull}
 63  * {@code class C {...}} could be treated by a type checker as indicating that
 64  * all variables of class {@code C} are non-null, while still allowing
 65  * variables of other classes to be non-null or not non-null based on whether
 66  * {@code @NonNull} appears at the variable&#39;s declaration.
