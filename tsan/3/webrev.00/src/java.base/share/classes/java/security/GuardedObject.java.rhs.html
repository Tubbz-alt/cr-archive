 29  * A GuardedObject is an object that is used to protect access to
 30  * another object.
 31  *
 32  * &lt;p&gt;A GuardedObject encapsulates a target object and a Guard object,
 33  * such that access to the target object is possible
 34  * only if the Guard object allows it.
 35  * Once an object is encapsulated by a GuardedObject,
 36  * access to that object is controlled by the {@code getObject}
 37  * method, which invokes the
 38  * {@code checkGuard} method on the Guard object that is
 39  * guarding access. If access is not allowed,
 40  * an exception is thrown.
