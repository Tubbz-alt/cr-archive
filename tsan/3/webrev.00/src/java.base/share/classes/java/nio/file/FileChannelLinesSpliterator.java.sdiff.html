 45  * bytes.

 47  * &lt;p&gt;
 48  * When the root spliterator is first split a mapped byte buffer will be created
 49  * over the file for it&#39;s size that was observed when the stream was created.
 50  * Thus a mapped byte buffer is only required for parallel stream execution.
 51  * Sub-spliterators will share that mapped byte buffer.  Splitting will use the
 52  * mapped byte buffer to find the closest line feed characters(s) to the left or
 53  * right of the mid-point of covered range of bytes of the file.  If a line feed
 54  * is found then the spliterator is split with returned spliterator containing
 55  * the identified line feed characters(s) at the end of it&#39;s covered range of
 56  * bytes.
 57  *
 58  * &lt;p&gt;
 59  * Traversing will create a buffered reader, derived from the file channel, for
 60  * the range of bytes of the file.  The lines are then read from that buffered
 61  * reader.  Once traversing commences no further splitting can be performed and
 62  * the reference to the mapped byte buffer will be set to null.
