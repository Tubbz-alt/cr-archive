 33  * This interface represents an X.509 extension.
 34  *
 35  * &lt;p&gt;
 36  * Extensions provide a means of associating additional attributes with users
 37  * or public keys and for managing a certification hierarchy.  The extension
 38  * format also allows communities to define private extensions to carry
 39  * information unique to those communities.
 40  *
 41  * &lt;p&gt;
 42  * Each extension contains an object identifier, a criticality setting
 43  * indicating whether it is a critical or a non-critical extension, and
 44  * an ASN.1 DER-encoded value. Its ASN.1 definition is:
 45  *
 46  * &lt;pre&gt;
 47  *
 48  *     Extension ::= SEQUENCE {
 49  *         extnId        OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
 50  *         critical      BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
 51  *         extnValue     OCTET STRING
 52  *                 -- contains a DER encoding of a value
 53  *                 -- of the type registered for use with
 54  *                 -- the extnId object identifier value
 55  *     }
 56  *
 57  * &lt;/pre&gt;
 58  *
 59  * &lt;p&gt;
 60  * This interface is designed to provide access to a single extension,
 61  * unlike {@link java.security.cert.X509Extension} which is more suitable
 62  * for accessing a set of extensions.
