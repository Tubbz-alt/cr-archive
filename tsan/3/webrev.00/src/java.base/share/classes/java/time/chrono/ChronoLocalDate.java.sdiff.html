 89  * A date without time-of-day or time-zone in an arbitrary chronology, intended
 90  * for advanced globalization use cases.
 91  * &lt;p&gt;
 92  * &lt;b&gt;Most applications should declare method signatures, fields and variables
 93  * as {@link LocalDate}, not this interface.&lt;/b&gt;
 94  * &lt;p&gt;
 95  * A {@code ChronoLocalDate} is the abstract representation of a date where the
 96  * {@code Chronology chronology}, or calendar system, is pluggable.
 97  * The date is defined in terms of fields expressed by {@link TemporalField},
 98  * where most common implementations are defined in {@link ChronoField}.
 99  * The chronology defines how the calendar system operates and the meaning of
100  * the standard fields.
101  *
<span class="line-modified">102  * &lt;h3&gt;When to use this interface&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
103  * The design of the API encourages the use of {@code LocalDate} rather than this
104  * interface, even in the case where the application needs to deal with multiple
105  * calendar systems.
106  * &lt;p&gt;
107  * This concept can seem surprising at first, as the natural way to globalize an
108  * application might initially appear to be to abstract the calendar system.
109  * However, as explored below, abstracting the calendar system is usually the wrong
110  * approach, resulting in logic errors and hard to find bugs.
111  * As such, it should be considered an application-wide architectural decision to choose
112  * to use this interface as opposed to {@code LocalDate}.
113  *
114  * &lt;h3&gt;Architectural issues to consider&lt;/h3&gt;
115  * These are some of the points that must be considered before using this interface
116  * throughout an application.
117  * &lt;p&gt;
118  * 1) Applications using this interface, as opposed to using just {@code LocalDate},
119  * face a significantly higher probability of bugs. This is because the calendar system
120  * in use is not known at development time. A key cause of bugs is where the developer
121  * applies assumptions from their day-to-day knowledge of the ISO calendar system
122  * to code that is intended to deal with any arbitrary calendar system.
