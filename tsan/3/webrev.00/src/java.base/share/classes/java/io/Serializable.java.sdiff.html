117  * ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object writeReplace() throws ObjectStreamException;
118  * &lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;p&gt;
119  *
120  * This writeReplace method is invoked by serialization if the method
121  * exists and it would be accessible from a method defined within the
122  * class of the object being serialized. Thus, the method can have private,
123  * protected and package-private access. Subclass access to this method
124  * follows java accessibility rules. &lt;p&gt;
125  *
126  * Classes that need to designate a replacement when an instance of it
127  * is read from the stream should implement this special method with the
128  * exact signature.
129  *
130  * &lt;PRE&gt;
131  * ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException;
132  * &lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;p&gt;
133  *
134  * This readResolve method follows the same invocation rules and
135  * accessibility rules as writeReplace.&lt;p&gt;
136  *





137  * The serialization runtime associates with each serializable class a version
138  * number, called a serialVersionUID, which is used during deserialization to
139  * verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded
140  * classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization.
141  * If the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has a different
142  * serialVersionUID than that of the corresponding sender&#39;s class, then
143  * deserialization will result in an {@link InvalidClassException}.  A
144  * serializable class can declare its own serialVersionUID explicitly by
<span class="line-modified">145  * declaring a field named &lt;code&gt;&quot;serialVersionUID&quot;&lt;/code&gt; that must be static,</span>
<span class="line-modified">146  * final, and of type &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;:</span>
147  *
148  * &lt;PRE&gt;
149  * ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER static final long serialVersionUID = 42L;
150  * &lt;/PRE&gt;
151  *
152  * If a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialVersionUID, then
153  * the serialization runtime will calculate a default serialVersionUID value
154  * for that class based on various aspects of the class, as described in the
<span class="line-modified">155  * Java(TM) Object Serialization Specification.  However, it is &lt;em&gt;strongly</span>
<span class="line-modified">156  * recommended&lt;/em&gt; that all serializable classes explicitly declare</span>

157  * serialVersionUID values, since the default serialVersionUID computation is
158  * highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler
159  * implementations, and can thus result in unexpected
<span class="line-modified">160  * &lt;code&gt;InvalidClassException&lt;/code&gt;s during deserialization.  Therefore, to</span>
161  * guarantee a consistent serialVersionUID value across different java compiler
162  * implementations, a serializable class must declare an explicit
163  * serialVersionUID value.  It is also strongly advised that explicit
<span class="line-modified">164  * serialVersionUID declarations use the &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; modifier where</span>
165  * possible, since such declarations apply only to the immediately declaring
166  * class--serialVersionUID fields are not useful as inherited members. Array
167  * classes cannot declare an explicit serialVersionUID, so they always have
168  * the default computed value, but the requirement for matching
169  * serialVersionUID values is waived for array classes.
