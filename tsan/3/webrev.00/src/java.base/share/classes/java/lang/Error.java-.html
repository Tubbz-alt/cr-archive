 29  * An {@code Error} is a subclass of {@code Throwable}
 30  * that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application
 31  * should not try to catch. Most such errors are abnormal conditions.
 32  * The {@code ThreadDeath} error, though a &quot;normal&quot; condition,
 33  * is also a subclass of {@code Error} because most applications
 34  * should not try to catch it.
 35  * &lt;p&gt;
 36  * A method is not required to declare in its {@code throws}
 37  * clause any subclasses of {@code Error} that might be thrown
 38  * during the execution of the method but not caught, since these
 39  * errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur.
 40  *
 41  * That is, {@code Error} and its subclasses are regarded as unchecked
 42  * exceptions for the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions.
