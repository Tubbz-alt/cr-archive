 39  * An {@link ExecutorService} that can schedule commands to run after a given
 40  * delay, or to execute periodically.
 41  *
 42  * &lt;p&gt;The {@code schedule} methods create tasks with various delays
 43  * and return a task object that can be used to cancel or check
 44  * execution. The {@code scheduleAtFixedRate} and
 45  * {@code scheduleWithFixedDelay} methods create and execute tasks
 46  * that run periodically until cancelled.
 47  *
 48  * &lt;p&gt;Commands submitted using the {@link Executor#execute(Runnable)}
 49  * and {@link ExecutorService} {@code submit} methods are scheduled
 50  * with a requested delay of zero. Zero and negative delays (but not
 51  * periods) are also allowed in {@code schedule} methods, and are
 52  * treated as requests for immediate execution.
 53  *
 54  * &lt;p&gt;All {@code schedule} methods accept &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; delays and
 55  * periods as arguments, not absolute times or dates. It is a simple
 56  * matter to transform an absolute time represented as a {@link
 57  * java.util.Date} to the required form. For example, to schedule at
 58  * a certain future {@code date}, you can use: {@code schedule(task,
 59  * date.getTime() - System.currentTimeMillis(),
 60  * TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)}. Beware however that expiration of a
 61  * relative delay need not coincide with the current {@code Date} at
 62  * which the task is enabled due to network time synchronization
 63  * protocols, clock drift, or other factors.
 64  *
 65  * &lt;p&gt;The {@link Executors} class provides convenient factory methods for
 66  * the ScheduledExecutorService implementations provided in this package.
 67  *
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified"> 68  * &lt;h3&gt;Usage Example&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
 69  *
 70  * Here is a class with a method that sets up a ScheduledExecutorService
 71  * to beep every ten seconds for an hour:
 72  *
 73  * &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 74  * import static java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.*;
 75  * class BeeperControl {
 76  *   private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler =
 77  *     Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
 78  *
 79  *   public void beepForAnHour() {
 80  *     Runnable beeper = () -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;beep&quot;);
 81  *     ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt; beeperHandle =
 82  *       scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(beeper, 10, 10, SECONDS);
 83  *     Runnable canceller = () -&gt; beeperHandle.cancel(false);
 84  *     scheduler.schedule(canceller, 1, HOURS);
 85  *   }
 86  * }}&lt;/pre&gt;
