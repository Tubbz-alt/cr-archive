 76  * Most date and time information can be represented as a number.
 77  * These are modeled using {@code TemporalField} with the number held using
 78  * a {@code long} to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month are
 79  * simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.
 80  * See {@link ChronoField} for the standard set of fields.
 81  * &lt;p&gt;
 82  * Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,
 83  * the {@linkplain java.time.chrono.Chronology chronology} and the
 84  * {@linkplain java.time.ZoneId time-zone}.
 85  * These can be accessed via {@link #query(TemporalQuery) queries} using
 86  * the static methods defined on {@link TemporalQuery}.
 87  * &lt;p&gt;
 88  * This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely
 89  * used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass
 90  * around instances of concrete types, such as {@code LocalDate}.
 91  * There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations
 92  * of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.
 93  * See {@link java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate} for a fuller discussion of the issues.
 94  *
<span class="line-modified"> 95  * &lt;h3&gt;When to implement&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
 96  * &lt;p&gt;
 97  * A class should implement this interface if it meets three criteria:
 98  * &lt;ul&gt;
 99  * &lt;li&gt;it provides access to date/time/offset information, as per {@code TemporalAccessor}
100  * &lt;li&gt;the set of fields are contiguous from the largest to the smallest
101  * &lt;li&gt;the set of fields are complete, such that no other field is needed to define the
102  *  valid range of values for the fields that are represented
103  * &lt;/ul&gt;
104  * &lt;p&gt;
105  * Four examples make this clear:
106  * &lt;ul&gt;
107  * &lt;li&gt;{@code LocalDate} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
108  *  that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information to determine
109  *  the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement plus/minus correctly.
110  * &lt;li&gt;{@code LocalTime} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
111  *  that are contiguous from nanos to within days and require no external information to determine
112  *  validity. It is able to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.
113  * &lt;li&gt;{@code MonthDay}, the combination of month-of-year and day-of-month, does not implement
114  *  this interface.  While the combination is contiguous, from days to months within years,
115  *  the combination does not have sufficient information to define the valid range of values
