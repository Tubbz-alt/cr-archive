 29  * Abstract class for representing access to a system resource.
 30  * All permissions have a name (whose interpretation depends on the subclass),
 31  * as well as abstract functions for defining the semantics of the
 32  * particular Permission subclass.
 33  *
 34  * &lt;p&gt;Most Permission objects also include an &quot;actions&quot; list that tells the actions
 35  * that are permitted for the object.  For example,
 36  * for a {@code java.io.FilePermission} object, the permission name is
 37  * the pathname of a file (or directory), and the actions list
 38  * (such as &quot;read, write&quot;) specifies which actions are granted for the
 39  * specified file (or for files in the specified directory).
 40  * The actions list is optional for Permission objects, such as
 41  * {@code java.lang.RuntimePermission},
 42  * that don&#39;t need such a list; you either have the named permission (such
 43  * as &quot;system.exit&quot;) or you don&#39;t.
 44  *
 45  * &lt;p&gt;An important method that must be implemented by each subclass is
 46  * the {@code implies} method to compare Permissions. Basically,
 47  * &quot;permission p1 implies permission p2&quot; means that
 48  * if one is granted permission p1, one is naturally granted permission p2.
 49  * Thus, this is not an equality test, but rather more of a
 50  * subset test.
 51  *
 52  * &lt;P&gt; Permission objects are similar to String objects in that they
 53  * are immutable once they have been created. Subclasses should not
 54  * provide methods that can change the state of a permission
 55  * once it has been created.
