30  * The {@code  TooManyListenersException } Exception is used as part of
31  * the Java Event model to annotate and implement a unicast special case of
32  * a multicast Event Source.
33  * &lt;/p&gt;
34  * &lt;p&gt;
35  * The presence of a &quot;throws TooManyListenersException&quot; clause on any given
36  * concrete implementation of the normally multicast &quot;void addXyzEventListener&quot;
37  * event listener registration pattern is used to annotate that interface as
38  * implementing a unicast Listener special case, that is, that one and only
39  * one Listener may be registered on the particular event listener source
40  * concurrently.
