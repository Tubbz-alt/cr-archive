 29  * This exception may be thrown by methods that have detected concurrent
 30  * modification of an object when such modification is not permissible.
 31  * &lt;p&gt;
 32  * For example, it is not generally permissible for one thread to modify a Collection
 33  * while another thread is iterating over it.  In general, the results of the
 34  * iteration are undefined under these circumstances.  Some Iterator
 35  * implementations (including those of all the general purpose collection implementations
 36  * provided by the JRE) may choose to throw this exception if this behavior is
 37  * detected.  Iterators that do this are known as &lt;i&gt;fail-fast&lt;/i&gt; iterators,
 38  * as they fail quickly and cleanly, rather that risking arbitrary,
 39  * non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.
 40  * &lt;p&gt;
 41  * Note that this exception does not always indicate that an object has
 42  * been concurrently modified by a &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; thread.  If a single
 43  * thread issues a sequence of method invocations that violates the
 44  * contract of an object, the object may throw this exception.  For
 45  * example, if a thread modifies a collection directly while it is
 46  * iterating over the collection with a fail-fast iterator, the iterator
 47  * will throw this exception.
 48  *
 49  * &lt;p&gt;Note that fail-fast behavior cannot be guaranteed as it is, generally
 50  * speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the presence of
 51  * unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast operations
 52  * throw {@code ConcurrentModificationException} on a best-effort basis.
 53  * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 54  * exception for its correctness: &lt;i&gt;{@code ConcurrentModificationException}
 55  * should be used only to detect bugs.&lt;/i&gt;
