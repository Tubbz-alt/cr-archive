27  * Classes for matching character sequences against patterns specified
28  * by regular expressions.
29  *
30  * &lt;p&gt; An instance of the {@link java.util.regex.Pattern} class
31  * represents a regular expression that is specified in string form in
32  * a syntax similar to that used by Perl.
33  *
34  * &lt;p&gt; Instances of the {@link java.util.regex.Matcher} class are used
35  * to match character sequences against a given pattern.  Input is
36  * provided to matchers via the {@link java.lang.CharSequence}
37  * interface in order to support matching against characters from a
38  * wide variety of input sources. &lt;/p&gt;
