 35  * A grouping of asynchronous channels for the purpose of resource sharing.
 36  *
 37  * &lt;p&gt; An asynchronous channel group encapsulates the mechanics required to
 38  * handle the completion of I/O operations initiated by {@link AsynchronousChannel
 39  * asynchronous channels} that are bound to the group. A group has an associated
 40  * thread pool to which tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch to
 41  * {@link CompletionHandler completion-handlers} that consume the result of
 42  * asynchronous operations performed on channels in the group. In addition to
 43  * handling I/O events, the pooled threads may also execute other tasks required
 44  * to support the execution of asynchronous I/O operations.
 45  *
 46  * &lt;p&gt; An asynchronous channel group is created by invoking the {@link
 47  * #withFixedThreadPool withFixedThreadPool} or {@link #withCachedThreadPool
 48  * withCachedThreadPool} methods defined here. Channels are bound to a group by
 49  * specifying the group when constructing the channel. The associated thread
 50  * pool is &lt;em&gt;owned&lt;/em&gt; by the group; termination of the group results in the
 51  * shutdown of the associated thread pool.
 52  *
 53  * &lt;p&gt; In addition to groups created explicitly, the Java virtual machine
 54  * maintains a system-wide &lt;em&gt;default group&lt;/em&gt; that is constructed
 55  * automatically. Asynchronous channels that do not specify a group at
 56  * construction time are bound to the default group. The default group has an
 57  * associated thread pool that creates new threads as needed. The default group
 58  * may be configured by means of system properties defined in the table below.
 59  * Where the {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory ThreadFactory} for the
 60  * default group is not configured then the pooled threads of the default group
 61  * are {@link Thread#isDaemon daemon} threads.
 62  *
 63  * &lt;table class=&quot;striped&quot;&gt;
 64  * &lt;caption style=&quot;display:none:&quot;&gt;System properties&lt;/caption&gt;
 65  *   &lt;thead&gt;
 66  *   &lt;tr&gt;
 67  *     &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;System property&lt;/th&gt;
 68  *     &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;

<span class="line-added"> 75  *     &lt;/th&gt;</span>
 76  *     &lt;td&gt; The value of this property is taken to be the fully-qualified name
 77  *     of a concrete {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory ThreadFactory}
 78  *     class. The class is loaded using the system class loader and instantiated.
 79  *     The factory&#39;s {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory#newThread
 80  *     newThread} method is invoked to create each thread for the default
 81  *     group&#39;s thread pool. If the process to load and instantiate the value
 82  *     of the property fails then an unspecified error is thrown during the
 83  *     construction of the default group. &lt;/td&gt;
 84  *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 85  *   &lt;tr&gt;
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a><span class="line-modified"> 86  *     &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;</span>

<span class="line-added"> 88  *     &lt;/th&gt;</span>
 89  *     &lt;td&gt; The value of the {@code initialSize} parameter for the default
 90  *     group (see {@link #withCachedThreadPool withCachedThreadPool}).
 91  *     The value of the property is taken to be the {@code String}
 92  *     representation of an {@code Integer} that is the initial size parameter.
 93  *     If the value cannot be parsed as an {@code Integer} it causes an
 94  *     unspecified error to be thrown during the construction of the default
 95  *     group. &lt;/td&gt;
 96  *   &lt;/tr&gt;
 97  *   &lt;/tbody&gt;
 98  * &lt;/table&gt;
 99  *
100  * &lt;a id=&quot;threading&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Threading&lt;/h2&gt;
101  *
102  * &lt;p&gt; The completion handler for an I/O operation initiated on a channel bound
103  * to a group is guaranteed to be invoked by one of the pooled threads in the
104  * group. This ensures that the completion handler is run by a thread with the
105  * expected &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt;.
106  *
107  * &lt;p&gt; Where an I/O operation completes immediately, and the initiating thread
108  * is one of the pooled threads in the group then the completion handler may
109  * be invoked directly by the initiating thread. To avoid stack overflow, an
110  * implementation may impose a limit as to the number of activations on the
111  * thread stack. Some I/O operations may prohibit invoking the completion
112  * handler directly by the initiating thread (see {@link
113  * AsynchronousServerSocketChannel#accept(Object,CompletionHandler) accept}).
114  *
115  * &lt;a id=&quot;shutdown&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shutdown and Termination&lt;/h2&gt;
116  *
117  * &lt;p&gt; The {@link #shutdown() shutdown} method is used to initiate an &lt;em&gt;orderly
118  * shutdown&lt;/em&gt; of a group. An orderly shutdown marks the group as shutdown;
119  * further attempts to construct a channel that binds to the group will throw
120  * {@link ShutdownChannelGroupException}. Whether or not a group is shutdown can
121  * be tested using the {@link #isShutdown() isShutdown} method. Once shutdown,
122  * the group &lt;em&gt;terminates&lt;/em&gt; when all asynchronous channels that are bound to
123  * the group are closed, all actively executing completion handlers have run to
124  * completion, and resources used by the group are released. No attempt is made
125  * to stop or interrupt threads that are executing completion handlers. The
126  * {@link #isTerminated() isTerminated} method is used to test if the group has
127  * terminated, and the {@link #awaitTermination awaitTermination} method can be
128  * used to block until the group has terminated.
129  *
130  * &lt;p&gt; The {@link #shutdownNow() shutdownNow} method can be used to initiate a
131  * &lt;em&gt;forceful shutdown&lt;/em&gt; of the group. In addition to the actions performed
132  * by an orderly shutdown, the {@code shutdownNow} method closes all open channels
133  * in the group as if by invoking the {@link AsynchronousChannel#close close}
134  * method.
