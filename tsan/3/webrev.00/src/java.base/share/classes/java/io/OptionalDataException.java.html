28  * Exception indicating the failure of an object read operation due to

30  * object in the stream.  This exception may be thrown in two cases:
31  *
32  * &lt;ul&gt;
33  *   &lt;li&gt;An attempt was made to read an object when the next element in the
34  *       stream is primitive data.  In this case, the OptionalDataException&#39;s
35  *       length field is set to the number of bytes of primitive data
36  *       immediately readable from the stream, and the eof field is set to
37  *       false.
38  *
39  *   &lt;li&gt;An attempt was made to read past the end of data consumable by a
40  *       class-defined readObject or readExternal method.  In this case, the
41  *       OptionalDataException&#39;s eof field is set to true, and the length field
42  *       is set to 0.
