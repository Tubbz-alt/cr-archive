 29  * The {@code Dictionary} class is the abstract parent of any
 30  * class, such as {@code Hashtable}, which maps keys to values.
 31  * Every key and every value is an object. In any one {@code Dictionary}
 32  * object, every key is associated with at most one value. Given a
 33  * {@code Dictionary} and a key, the associated element can be looked up.
 34  * Any non-{@code null} object can be used as a key and as a value.
 35  * &lt;p&gt;
 36  * As a rule, the {@code equals} method should be used by
 37  * implementations of this class to decide if two keys are the same.
 38  * &lt;p&gt;
 39  * &lt;strong&gt;NOTE: This class is obsolete.  New implementations should
 40  * implement the Map interface, rather than extending this class.&lt;/strong&gt;
