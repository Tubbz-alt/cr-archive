 39  * Base implementation class for interruptible channels.
 40  *
 41  * &lt;p&gt; This class encapsulates the low-level machinery required to implement
 42  * the asynchronous closing and interruption of channels.  A concrete channel
 43  * class must invoke the {@link #begin begin} and {@link #end end} methods
 44  * before and after, respectively, invoking an I/O operation that might block
 45  * indefinitely.  In order to ensure that the {@link #end end} method is always
 46  * invoked, these methods should be used within a
 47  * {@code try}&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;{@code finally} block:
 48  *
 49  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre id=&quot;be&quot;&gt;
 50  * boolean completed = false;
 51  * try {
 52  *     begin();
 53  *     completed = ...;    // Perform blocking I/O operation
 54  *     return ...;         // Return result
 55  * } finally {
 56  *     end(completed);
 57  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 58  *
 59  * &lt;p&gt; The {@code completed} argument to the {@link #end end} method tells
 60  * whether or not the I/O operation actually completed, that is, whether it had
 61  * any effect that would be visible to the invoker.  In the case of an
 62  * operation that reads bytes, for example, this argument should be
 63  * {@code true} if, and only if, some bytes were actually transferred into the
 64  * invoker&#39;s target buffer.
 65  *
 66  * &lt;p&gt; A concrete channel class must also implement the {@link
 67  * #implCloseChannel implCloseChannel} method in such a way that if it is
 68  * invoked while another thread is blocked in a native I/O operation upon the
 69  * channel then that operation will immediately return, either by throwing an
 70  * exception or by returning normally.  If a thread is interrupted or the
 71  * channel upon which it is blocked is asynchronously closed then the channel&#39;s
 72  * {@link #end end} method will throw the appropriate exception.
 73  *
 74  * &lt;p&gt; This class performs the synchronization required to implement the {@link
 75  * java.nio.channels.Channel} specification.  Implementations of the {@link
 76  * #implCloseChannel implCloseChannel} method need not synchronize against
 77  * other threads that might be attempting to close the channel.  &lt;/p&gt;
