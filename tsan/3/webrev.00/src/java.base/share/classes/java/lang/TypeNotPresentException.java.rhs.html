29  * Thrown when an application tries to access a type using a string
30  * representing the type&#39;s name, but no definition for the type with
31  * the specified name can be found.   This exception differs from
32  * {@link ClassNotFoundException} in that {@code ClassNotFoundException} is a
33  * checked exception, whereas this exception is unchecked.
34  *
35  * &lt;p&gt;Note that this exception may be used when undefined type variables
36  * are accessed as well as when types (e.g., classes, interfaces or
37  * annotation types) are loaded.
38  * In particular, this exception can be thrown by the {@linkplain
39  * java.lang.reflect.AnnotatedElement API used to read annotations
40  * reflectively}.
