 33  * A channel that can read bytes into a sequence of buffers.

 35  * &lt;p&gt; A &lt;i&gt;scattering&lt;/i&gt; read operation reads, in a single invocation, a
 36  * sequence of bytes into one or more of a given sequence of buffers.
 37  * Scattering reads are often useful when implementing network protocols or
 38  * file formats that, for example, group data into segments consisting of one
 39  * or more fixed-length headers followed by a variable-length body.  Similar
 40  * &lt;i&gt;gathering&lt;/i&gt; write operations are defined in the {@link
 41  * GatheringByteChannel} interface.  &lt;/p&gt;
