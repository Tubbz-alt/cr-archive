 31  * An exception indicating one of a variety of problems retrieving
 32  * certificates and CRLs from a {@code CertStore}.
 33  * &lt;p&gt;
 34  * A {@code CertStoreException} provides support for wrapping
 35  * exceptions. The {@link #getCause getCause} method returns the throwable,
 36  * if any, that caused this exception to be thrown.
 37  * &lt;p&gt;
 38  * &lt;b&gt;Concurrent Access&lt;/b&gt;

 40  * Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
 41  * thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
 42  * object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
 43  * provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
 44  * separate objects need not synchronize.
