 29  * The abstract class {@code Number} is the superclass of platform
 30  * classes representing numeric values that are convertible to the
 31  * primitive types {@code byte}, {@code double}, {@code float}, {@code
 32  * int}, {@code long}, and {@code short}.
 33  *
 34  * The specific semantics of the conversion from the numeric value of
 35  * a particular {@code Number} implementation to a given primitive
 36  * type is defined by the {@code Number} implementation in question.
 37  *
 38  * For platform classes, the conversion is often analogous to a
 39  * narrowing primitive conversion or a widening primitive conversion
 40  * as defined in &lt;cite&gt;The Java&amp;trade; Language Specification&lt;/cite&gt;
 41  * for converting between primitive types.  Therefore, conversions may
 42  * lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value, may
 43  * lose precision, and may even return a result of a different sign
 44  * than the input.
 45  *
 46  * See the documentation of a given {@code Number} implementation for
 47  * conversion details.
