<a name="3" id="anc3"></a><span class="line-modified"> 43  * This class provides the method {@code normalize} which transforms Unicode</span>
 44  * text into an equivalent composed or decomposed form, allowing for easier
 45  * sorting and searching of text.
<a name="4" id="anc4"></a><span class="line-modified"> 46  * The {@code normalize} method supports the standard normalization forms</span>
 47  * described in
 48  * &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/tr15-23.html&quot;&gt;
 49  * Unicode Standard Annex #15 &amp;mdash; Unicode Normalization Forms&lt;/a&gt;.
 50  * &lt;p&gt;
 51  * Characters with accents or other adornments can be encoded in
 52  * several different ways in Unicode.  For example, take the character A-acute.
 53  * In Unicode, this can be encoded as a single character (the &quot;composed&quot; form):
 54  *
 55  * &lt;pre&gt;
 56  *      U+00C1    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE&lt;/pre&gt;
 57  *
 58  * or as two separate characters (the &quot;decomposed&quot; form):
 59  *
 60  * &lt;pre&gt;
 61  *      U+0041    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
 62  *      U+0301    COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT&lt;/pre&gt;
 63  *
 64  * To a user of your program, however, both of these sequences should be
 65  * treated as the same &quot;user-level&quot; character &quot;A with acute accent&quot;.  When you
 66  * are searching or comparing text, you must ensure that these two sequences are
 67  * treated as equivalent.  In addition, you must handle characters with more than
 68  * one accent. Sometimes the order of a character&#39;s combining accents is
 69  * significant, while in other cases accent sequences in different orders are
 70  * really equivalent.
 71  * &lt;p&gt;
 72  * Similarly, the string &quot;ffi&quot; can be encoded as three separate letters:
 73  *
 74  * &lt;pre&gt;
 75  *      U+0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
 76  *      U+0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
 77  *      U+0069    LATIN SMALL LETTER I&lt;/pre&gt;
 78  *
 79  * or as the single character
 80  *
 81  * &lt;pre&gt;
 82  *      U+FB03    LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI&lt;/pre&gt;
 83  *
 84  * The ffi ligature is not a distinct semantic character, and strictly speaking
 85  * it shouldn&#39;t be in Unicode at all, but it was included for compatibility
 86  * with existing character sets that already provided it.  The Unicode standard
 87  * identifies such characters by giving them &quot;compatibility&quot; decompositions
 88  * into the corresponding semantic characters.  When sorting and searching, you
 89  * will often want to use these mappings.
 90  * &lt;p&gt;
<a name="5" id="anc5"></a><span class="line-modified"> 91  * The {@code normalize} method helps solve these problems by transforming</span>
 92  * text into the canonical composed and decomposed forms as shown in the first
 93  * example above. In addition, you can have it perform compatibility
 94  * decompositions so that you can treat compatibility characters the same as
 95  * their equivalents.
<a name="6" id="anc6"></a><span class="line-modified"> 96  * Finally, the {@code normalize} method rearranges accents into the</span>
 97  * proper canonical order, so that you do not have to worry about accent
 98  * rearrangement on your own.
 99  * &lt;p&gt;
100  * The W3C generally recommends to exchange texts in NFC.
101  * Note also that most legacy character encodings use only precomposed forms and
102  * often do not encode any combining marks by themselves. For conversion to such
103  * character encodings the Unicode text needs to be normalized to NFC.
104  * For more usage examples, see the Unicode Standard Annex.
