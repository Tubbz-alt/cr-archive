 32  * This is the interface used for representing one entry in an Access
 33  * Control List (ACL).&lt;p&gt;
 34  *
 35  * An ACL can be thought of as a data structure with multiple ACL entry
 36  * objects. Each ACL entry object contains a set of permissions associated
 37  * with a particular principal. (A principal represents an entity such as
 38  * an individual user or a group). Additionally, each ACL entry is specified
 39  * as being either positive or negative. If positive, the permissions are
 40  * to be granted to the associated principal. If negative, the permissions
 41  * are to be denied. Each principal can have at most one positive ACL entry
 42  * and one negative entry; that is, multiple positive or negative ACL
 43  * entries are not allowed for any principal.
 44  *
 45  * Note: ACL entries are by default positive. An entry becomes a
 46  * negative entry only if the
 47  * {@link #setNegativePermissions() setNegativePermissions}
 48  * method is called on it.
