29  * The {@code Runnable} interface should be implemented by any
30  * class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. The
31  * class must define a method of no arguments called {@code run}.
32  * &lt;p&gt;
33  * This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
34  * wish to execute code while they are active. For example,
35  * {@code Runnable} is implemented by class {@code Thread}.
36  * Being active simply means that a thread has been started and has not
37  * yet been stopped.
38  * &lt;p&gt;
39  * In addition, {@code Runnable} provides the means for a class to be
40  * active while not subclassing {@code Thread}. A class that implements
41  * {@code Runnable} can run without subclassing {@code Thread}
42  * by instantiating a {@code Thread} instance and passing itself in
43  * as the target.  In most cases, the {@code Runnable} interface should
44  * be used if you are only planning to override the {@code run()}
45  * method and no other {@code Thread} methods.
46  * This is important because classes should not be subclassed
47  * unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental
48  * behavior of the class.
