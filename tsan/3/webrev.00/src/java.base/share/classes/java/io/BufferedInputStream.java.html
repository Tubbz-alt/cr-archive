 32  * A {@code BufferedInputStream} adds
 33  * functionality to another input stream-namely,
 34  * the ability to buffer the input and to
 35  * support the {@code mark} and {@code reset}
 36  * methods. When  the {@code BufferedInputStream}
 37  * is created, an internal buffer array is
 38  * created. As bytes  from the stream are read
 39  * or skipped, the internal buffer is refilled
 40  * as necessary  from the contained input stream,
 41  * many bytes at a time. The {@code mark}
 42  * operation  remembers a point in the input
 43  * stream and the {@code reset} operation
 44  * causes all the  bytes read since the most
 45  * recent {@code mark} operation to be
 46  * reread before new bytes are  taken from
 47  * the contained input stream.
