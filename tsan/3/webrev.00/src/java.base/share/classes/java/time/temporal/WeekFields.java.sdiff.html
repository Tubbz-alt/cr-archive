 105  * &lt;p&gt;
 106  * The computations for day-of-week, week-of-month, and week-of-year are based
 107  * on the  {@linkplain ChronoField#YEAR proleptic-year},
 108  * {@linkplain ChronoField#MONTH_OF_YEAR month-of-year},
 109  * {@linkplain ChronoField#DAY_OF_MONTH day-of-month}, and
 110  * {@linkplain ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK ISO day-of-week} which are based on the
 111  * {@linkplain ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY epoch-day} and the chronology.
 112  * The values may not be aligned with the {@linkplain ChronoField#YEAR_OF_ERA year-of-Era}

 114  * &lt;p&gt;A week is defined by:

 118  * &lt;li&gt;The minimal number of days in the first week.
 119  * For example, the ISO-8601 standard counts the first week as needing at least 4 days.
