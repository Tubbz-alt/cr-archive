  77  * Service-provider class for file systems. The methods defined by the {@link
  78  * java.nio.file.Files} class will typically delegate to an instance of this
  79  * class.
  80  *
  81  * &lt;p&gt; A file system provider is a concrete implementation of this class that
  82  * implements the abstract methods defined by this class. A provider is
  83  * identified by a {@code URI} {@link #getScheme() scheme}. The default provider
  84  * is identified by the URI scheme &quot;file&quot;. It creates the {@link FileSystem} that
  85  * provides access to the file systems accessible to the Java virtual machine.
  86  * The {@link FileSystems} class defines how file system providers are located
  87  * and loaded. The default provider is typically a system-default provider but
<span class="line-modified">  88  * may be overridden if the system property {@code</span>
  89  * java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider} is set. In that case, the
  90  * provider has a one argument constructor whose formal parameter type is {@code
  91  * FileSystemProvider}. All other providers have a zero argument constructor
  92  * that initializes the provider.
  93  *
  94  * &lt;p&gt; A provider is a factory for one or more {@link FileSystem} instances. Each
  95  * file system is identified by a {@code URI} where the URI&#39;s scheme matches
  96  * the provider&#39;s {@link #getScheme scheme}. The default file system, for example,
  97  * is identified by the URI {@code &quot;file:///&quot;}. A memory-based file system,
  98  * for example, may be identified by a URI such as {@code &quot;memory:///?name=logfs&quot;}.
  99  * The {@link #newFileSystem newFileSystem} method may be used to create a file
 100  * system, and the {@link #getFileSystem getFileSystem} method may be used to
 101  * obtain a reference to an existing file system created by the provider. Where
 102  * a provider is the factory for a single file system then it is provider dependent
 103  * if the file system is created when the provider is initialized, or later when
 104  * the {@code newFileSystem} method is invoked. In the case of the default
 105  * provider, the {@code FileSystem} is created when the provider is initialized.
 106  *
 107  * &lt;p&gt; All of the methods in this class are safe for use by multiple concurrent
 108  * threads.
