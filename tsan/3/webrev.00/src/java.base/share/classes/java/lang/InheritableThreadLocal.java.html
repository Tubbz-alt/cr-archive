30  * This class extends {@code ThreadLocal} to provide inheritance of values
31  * from parent thread to child thread: when a child thread is created, the
32  * child receives initial values for all inheritable thread-local variables
33  * for which the parent has values.  Normally the child&#39;s values will be
34  * identical to the parent&#39;s; however, the child&#39;s value can be made an
35  * arbitrary function of the parent&#39;s by overriding the {@code childValue}
36  * method in this class.
37  *
38  * &lt;p&gt;Inheritable thread-local variables are used in preference to
39  * ordinary thread-local variables when the per-thread-attribute being
40  * maintained in the variable (e.g., User ID, Transaction ID) must be
41  * automatically transmitted to any child threads that are created.
42  *
43  * &lt;p&gt;Note: During the creation of a new {@link
44  * Thread#Thread(ThreadGroup,Runnable,String,long,boolean) thread}, it is
45  * possible to &lt;i&gt;opt out&lt;/i&gt; of receiving initial values for inheritable
46  * thread-local variables.
