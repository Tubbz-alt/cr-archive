 31  * &lt;p&gt;
 32  * This is the super class of all the locale sensitive service provider
 33  * interfaces (SPIs).
 34  * &lt;p&gt;
 35  * Locale sensitive  service provider interfaces are interfaces that
<span class="line-modified"> 36  * correspond to locale sensitive classes in the &lt;code&gt;java.text&lt;/code&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 37  * and &lt;code&gt;java.util&lt;/code&gt; packages. The interfaces enable the</span>
 38  * construction of locale sensitive objects and the retrieval of
 39  * localized names for these packages. Locale sensitive factory methods
<span class="line-modified"> 40  * and methods for name retrieval in the &lt;code&gt;java.text&lt;/code&gt; and</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 41  * &lt;code&gt;java.util&lt;/code&gt; packages use implementations of the provider</span>
 42  * interfaces to offer support for locales beyond the set of locales
 43  * supported by the Java runtime environment itself.
 44  *
<span class="line-modified"> 45  * &lt;h3&gt;Packaging of Locale Sensitive Service Provider Implementations&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
 46  * Implementations of these locale sensitive services can be made available
 47  * by adding them to the application&#39;s class path. A provider identifies itself with a
 48  * provider-configuration file in the resource directory META-INF/services,
 49  * using the fully qualified provider interface class name as the file name.
 50  * The file should contain a list of fully-qualified concrete provider class names,
 51  * one per line. A line is terminated by any one of a line feed (&#39;\n&#39;), a carriage
 52  * return (&#39;\r&#39;), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed. Space
 53  * and tab characters surrounding each name, as well as blank lines, are ignored.
 54  * The comment character is &#39;#&#39; (&#39;\u0023&#39;); on each line all characters following
 55  * the first comment character are ignored. The file must be encoded in UTF-8.
 56  * &lt;p&gt;
 57  * If a particular concrete provider class is named in more than one configuration
 58  * file, or is named in the same configuration file more than once, then the
 59  * duplicates will be ignored. The configuration file naming a particular provider
 60  * need not be in the same jar file or other distribution unit as the provider itself.
 61  * The provider must be accessible from the same class loader that was initially
 62  * queried to locate the configuration file; this is not necessarily the class loader
 63  * that loaded the file.
 64  * &lt;p&gt;
 65  * For example, an implementation of the
 66  * {@link java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider DateFormatProvider} class should
 67  * take the form of a jar file which contains the file:
 68  * &lt;pre&gt;
 69  * META-INF/services/java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider
 70  * &lt;/pre&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 71  * And the file &lt;code&gt;java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider&lt;/code&gt; should have</span>
 72  * a line such as:
 73  * &lt;pre&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 74  * &lt;code&gt;com.foo.DateFormatProviderImpl&lt;/code&gt;</span>
 75  * &lt;/pre&gt;
 76  * which is the fully qualified class name of the class implementing
<span class="line-modified"> 77  * &lt;code&gt;DateFormatProvider&lt;/code&gt;.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 78  * &lt;h4&gt;Invocation of Locale Sensitive Services&lt;/h4&gt;</span>
 79  * &lt;p&gt;
 80  * Locale sensitive factory methods and methods for name retrieval in the
<span class="line-modified"> 81  * &lt;code&gt;java.text&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;java.util&lt;/code&gt; packages invoke</span>
 82  * service provider methods when needed to support the requested locale.
 83  * The methods first check whether the Java runtime environment itself
 84  * supports the requested locale, and use its support if available.
 85  * Otherwise, they call the {@link #isSupportedLocale(Locale) isSupportedLocale}
 86  * methods of installed providers for the appropriate interface to find one that
 87  * supports the requested locale. If such a provider is found, its other
 88  * methods are called to obtain the requested object or name.  When checking
 89  * whether a locale is supported, the &lt;a href=&quot;../Locale.html#def_extensions&quot;&gt;
 90  * locale&#39;s extensions&lt;/a&gt; are ignored by default. (If locale&#39;s extensions should
 91  * also be checked, the {@code isSupportedLocale} method must be overridden.)
 92  * If neither the Java runtime environment itself nor an installed provider
 93  * supports the requested locale, the methods go through a list of candidate
 94  * locales and repeat the availability check for each until a match is found.
 95  * The algorithm used for creating a list of candidate locales is same as
<span class="line-modified"> 96  * the one used by &lt;code&gt;ResourceBundle&lt;/code&gt; by default (see</span>
 97  * {@link java.util.ResourceBundle.Control#getCandidateLocales getCandidateLocales}
 98  * for the details).  Even if a locale is resolved from the candidate list,
 99  * methods that return requested objects or names are invoked with the original
100  * requested locale including {@code Locale} extensions. The Java runtime
101  * environment must support the root locale for all locale sensitive services in
102  * order to guarantee that this process terminates.
103  * &lt;p&gt;
104  * Providers of names (but not providers of other objects) are allowed to
105  * return null for some name requests even for locales that they claim to
106  * support by including them in their return value for
<span class="line-modified">107  * &lt;code&gt;getAvailableLocales&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly, the Java runtime</span>
108  * environment itself may not have all names for all locales that it
109  * supports. This is because the sets of objects for which names are
110  * requested can be large and vary over time, so that it&#39;s not always
111  * feasible to cover them completely. If the Java runtime environment or a
112  * provider returns null instead of a name, the lookup will proceed as
113  * described above as if the locale was not supported.
114  * &lt;p&gt;
115  * The search order of locale sensitive services can
116  * be configured by using the {@systemProperty java.locale.providers} system property.
117  * This system property declares the user&#39;s preferred order for looking up
118  * the locale sensitive services separated by a comma. It is only read at
119  * the Java runtime startup, so the later call to System.setProperty() won&#39;t
120  * affect the order.
121  * &lt;p&gt;
122  * Java Runtime Environment provides the following four locale providers:
123  * &lt;ul&gt;
124  * &lt;li&gt; &quot;CLDR&quot;: A provider based on Unicode Consortium&#39;s
125  * &lt;a href=&quot;http://cldr.unicode.org/&quot;&gt;CLDR Project&lt;/a&gt;.
126  * &lt;li&gt; &quot;COMPAT&quot;: represents the locale sensitive services that is compatible
127  * with the prior JDK releases up to JDK8 (same as JDK8&#39;s &quot;JRE&quot;).
