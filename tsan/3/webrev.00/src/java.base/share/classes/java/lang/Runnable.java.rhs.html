<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">29  * The {@code Runnable} interface should be implemented by any</span>
30  * class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. The
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a><span class="line-modified">31  * class must define a method of no arguments called {@code run}.</span>
32  * &lt;p&gt;
33  * This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
34  * wish to execute code while they are active. For example,
<a name="4" id="anc4"></a><span class="line-modified">35  * {@code Runnable} is implemented by class {@code Thread}.</span>
36  * Being active simply means that a thread has been started and has not
37  * yet been stopped.
38  * &lt;p&gt;
<a name="5" id="anc5"></a><span class="line-modified">39  * In addition, {@code Runnable} provides the means for a class to be</span>
<span class="line-modified">40  * active while not subclassing {@code Thread}. A class that implements</span>
<span class="line-modified">41  * {@code Runnable} can run without subclassing {@code Thread}</span>
<span class="line-modified">42  * by instantiating a {@code Thread} instance and passing itself in</span>
<span class="line-modified">43  * as the target.  In most cases, the {@code Runnable} interface should</span>
<span class="line-modified">44  * be used if you are only planning to override the {@code run()}</span>
<span class="line-modified">45  * method and no other {@code Thread} methods.</span>
46  * This is important because classes should not be subclassed
47  * unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental
48  * behavior of the class.
