 42  * A {@code CollationKey} represents a {@code String} under the
 43  * rules of a specific {@code Collator} object. Comparing two
 44  * {@code CollationKey}s returns the relative order of the
 45  * {@code String}s they represent. Using {@code CollationKey}s
 46  * to compare {@code String}s is generally faster than using
 47  * {@code Collator.compare}. Thus, when the {@code String}s
 48  * must be compared multiple times, for example when sorting a list
 49  * of {@code String}s. It&#39;s more efficient to use {@code CollationKey}s.
 50  *
 51  * &lt;p&gt;
 52  * You can not create {@code CollationKey}s directly. Rather,
 53  * generate them by calling {@code Collator.getCollationKey}.
 54  * You can only compare {@code CollationKey}s generated from
 55  * the same {@code Collator} object.
 56  *
 57  * &lt;p&gt;
 58  * Generating a {@code CollationKey} for a {@code String}
 59  * involves examining the entire {@code String}
 60  * and converting it to series of bits that can be compared bitwise. This
 61  * allows fast comparisons once the keys are generated. The cost of generating
 62  * keys is recouped in faster comparisons when {@code String}s need
 63  * to be compared many times. On the other hand, the result of a comparison
 64  * is often determined by the first couple of characters of each {@code String}.
 65  * {@code Collator.compare} examines only as many characters as it needs which
 66  * allows it to be faster when doing single comparisons.
 67  * &lt;p&gt;
 68  * The following example shows how {@code CollationKey}s might be used
 69  * to sort a list of {@code String}s.
 70  * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 71  * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 72  * // Create an array of CollationKeys for the Strings to be sorted.
 73  * Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();
 74  * CollationKey[] keys = new CollationKey[3];
 75  * keys[0] = myCollator.getCollationKey(&quot;Tom&quot;);
 76  * keys[1] = myCollator.getCollationKey(&quot;Dick&quot;);
 77  * keys[2] = myCollator.getCollationKey(&quot;Harry&quot;);
 78  * sort(keys);
 79  *
 80  * //...
 81  *
 82  * // Inside body of sort routine, compare keys this way
 83  * if (keys[i].compareTo(keys[j]) &gt; 0)
 84  *    // swap keys[i] and keys[j]
 85  *
 86  * //...
 87  *
 88  * // Finally, when we&#39;ve returned from sort.
 89  * System.out.println(keys[0].getSourceString());
 90  * System.out.println(keys[1].getSourceString());
 91  * System.out.println(keys[2].getSourceString());
 92  * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 93  * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
