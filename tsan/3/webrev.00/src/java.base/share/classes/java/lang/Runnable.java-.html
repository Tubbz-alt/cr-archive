29  * The &lt;code&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; interface should be implemented by any
30  * class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. The
31  * class must define a method of no arguments called &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt;.
32  * &lt;p&gt;
33  * This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
34  * wish to execute code while they are active. For example,
35  * &lt;code&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; is implemented by class &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt;.
36  * Being active simply means that a thread has been started and has not
37  * yet been stopped.
38  * &lt;p&gt;
39  * In addition, &lt;code&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; provides the means for a class to be
40  * active while not subclassing &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt;. A class that implements
41  * &lt;code&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; can run without subclassing &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt;
42  * by instantiating a &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt; instance and passing itself in
43  * as the target.  In most cases, the &lt;code&gt;Runnable&lt;/code&gt; interface should
44  * be used if you are only planning to override the &lt;code&gt;run()&lt;/code&gt;
45  * method and no other &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt; methods.
46  * This is important because classes should not be subclassed
47  * unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental
48  * behavior of the class.
