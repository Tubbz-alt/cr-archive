   * The serialization runtime associates with each serializable class a version
   * number, called a serialVersionUID, which is used during deserialization to
   * verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded
   * classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization.
   * If the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has a different
   * serialVersionUID than that of the corresponding sender&#39;s class, then
   * deserialization will result in an {@link InvalidClassException}.  A
   * serializable class can declare its own serialVersionUID explicitly by
<span class="line-modified">!  * declaring a field named &lt;code&gt;&quot;serialVersionUID&quot;&lt;/code&gt; that must be static,</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * final, and of type &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;:</span>
   *
   * &lt;PRE&gt;
   * ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER static final long serialVersionUID = 42L;
   * &lt;/PRE&gt;
   *
   * If a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialVersionUID, then
   * the serialization runtime will calculate a default serialVersionUID value
   * for that class based on various aspects of the class, as described in the
<span class="line-modified">!  * Java(TM) Object Serialization Specification.  However, it is &lt;em&gt;strongly</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * recommended&lt;/em&gt; that all serializable classes explicitly declare</span>
   * serialVersionUID values, since the default serialVersionUID computation is
   * highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler
   * implementations, and can thus result in unexpected
<span class="line-modified">!  * &lt;code&gt;InvalidClassException&lt;/code&gt;s during deserialization.  Therefore, to</span>
   * guarantee a consistent serialVersionUID value across different java compiler
   * implementations, a serializable class must declare an explicit
   * serialVersionUID value.  It is also strongly advised that explicit
<span class="line-modified">!  * serialVersionUID declarations use the &lt;code&gt;private&lt;/code&gt; modifier where</span>
   * possible, since such declarations apply only to the immediately declaring
   * class--serialVersionUID fields are not useful as inherited members. Array
   * classes cannot declare an explicit serialVersionUID, so they always have
   * the default computed value, but the requirement for matching
   * serialVersionUID values is waived for array classes.
