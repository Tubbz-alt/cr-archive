 67  * Framework-level interface defining read-write access to a temporal object,
 68  * such as a date, time, offset or some combination of these.
 69  * &lt;p&gt;
 70  * This is the base interface type for date, time and offset objects that
 71  * are complete enough to be manipulated using plus and minus.
 72  * It is implemented by those classes that can provide and manipulate information
 73  * as {@linkplain TemporalField fields} or {@linkplain TemporalQuery queries}.
 74  * See {@link TemporalAccessor} for the read-only version of this interface.
 75  * &lt;p&gt;
 76  * Most date and time information can be represented as a number.
 77  * These are modeled using {@code TemporalField} with the number held using
 78  * a {@code long} to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month are
 79  * simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.
 80  * See {@link ChronoField} for the standard set of fields.
 81  * &lt;p&gt;
 82  * Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,
 83  * the {@linkplain java.time.chrono.Chronology chronology} and the
 84  * {@linkplain java.time.ZoneId time-zone}.
 85  * These can be accessed via {@link #query(TemporalQuery) queries} using
 86  * the static methods defined on {@link TemporalQuery}.
 87  * &lt;p&gt;
 88  * This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely
 89  * used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass
 90  * around instances of concrete types, such as {@code LocalDate}.
 91  * There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations
 92  * of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.
 93  * See {@link java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate} for a fuller discussion of the issues.
 94  *
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified"> 95  * &lt;h3&gt;When to implement&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
 96  * &lt;p&gt;
 97  * A class should implement this interface if it meets three criteria:
 98  * &lt;ul&gt;
 99  * &lt;li&gt;it provides access to date/time/offset information, as per {@code TemporalAccessor}
100  * &lt;li&gt;the set of fields are contiguous from the largest to the smallest
101  * &lt;li&gt;the set of fields are complete, such that no other field is needed to define the
102  *  valid range of values for the fields that are represented
103  * &lt;/ul&gt;
104  * &lt;p&gt;
105  * Four examples make this clear:
106  * &lt;ul&gt;
107  * &lt;li&gt;{@code LocalDate} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
108  *  that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information to determine
109  *  the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement plus/minus correctly.
110  * &lt;li&gt;{@code LocalTime} implements this interface as it represents a set of fields
111  *  that are contiguous from nanos to within days and require no external information to determine
112  *  validity. It is able to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.
113  * &lt;li&gt;{@code MonthDay}, the combination of month-of-year and day-of-month, does not implement
114  *  this interface.  While the combination is contiguous, from days to months within years,
115  *  the combination does not have sufficient information to define the valid range of values
116  *  for day-of-month.  As such, it is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.
117  * &lt;li&gt;The combination day-of-week and day-of-month (&quot;Friday the 13th&quot;) should not implement
118  *  this interface. It does not represent a contiguous set of fields, as days to weeks overlaps
119  *  days to months.
120  * &lt;/ul&gt;
121  *
122  * @implSpec
123  * This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,
124  * however immutability is strongly recommended.
125  * All implementations must be {@link Comparable}.
126  *
127  * @since 1.8

382      * For example, the amount in hours between two temporal objects can be
383      * calculated using {@code startTime.until(endTime, HOURS)}.
384      * &lt;p&gt;
385      * The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
386      * complete units between the two temporals.
387      * For example, the amount in hours between the times 11:30 and 13:29
388      * will only be one hour as it is one minute short of two hours.
389      * &lt;p&gt;
390      * There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
391      * The first is to invoke this method directly.
392      * The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
393      * &lt;pre&gt;
394      *   // these two lines are equivalent
395      *   temporal = start.until(end, unit);
396      *   temporal = unit.between(start, end);
397      * &lt;/pre&gt;
398      * The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
399      * &lt;p&gt;
400      * For example, this method allows the number of days between two dates to
401      * be calculated:
402      * &lt;pre&gt;
403      *  long daysBetween = start.until(end, DAYS);
404      *  // or alternatively
405      *  long daysBetween = DAYS.between(start, end);
406      * &lt;/pre&gt;
407      *
408      * @implSpec
409      * Implementations must begin by checking to ensure that the input temporal
410      * object is of the same observable type as the implementation.
411      * They must then perform the calculation for all instances of {@link ChronoUnit}.
412      * An {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException} must be thrown for {@code ChronoUnit}
413      * instances that are unsupported.
414      * &lt;p&gt;
415      * If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
416      * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
417      * passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal as
418      * the second argument.
419      * &lt;p&gt;
420      * In summary, implementations must behave in a manner equivalent to this pseudo-code:
421      * &lt;pre&gt;
422      *  // convert the end temporal to the same type as this class
423      *  if (unit instanceof ChronoUnit) {
424      *    // if unit is supported, then calculate and return result
425      *    // else throw UnsupportedTemporalTypeException for unsupported units
426      *  }
427      *  return unit.between(this, convertedEndTemporal);
428      * &lt;/pre&gt;
429      * &lt;p&gt;
430      * Note that the unit&#39;s {@code between} method must only be invoked if the
431      * two temporal objects have exactly the same type evaluated by {@code getClass()}.
432      * &lt;p&gt;
433      * Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
434      * read-only method is invoked.
435      *
436      * @param endExclusive  the end temporal, exclusive, converted to be of the
437      *  same type as this object, not null
438      * @param unit  the unit to measure the amount in, not null
439      * @return the amount of time between this temporal object and the specified one
440      *  in terms of the unit; positive if the specified object is later than this one,
441      *  negative if it is earlier than this one
442      * @throws DateTimeException if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
443      *  temporal cannot be converted to the same type as this temporal
444      * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported
445      * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
