 49  * method will allow previously submitted tasks to execute before
 50  * terminating, while the {@link #shutdownNow} method prevents waiting
 51  * tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently executing tasks.
 52  * Upon termination, an executor has no tasks actively executing, no
 53  * tasks awaiting execution, and no new tasks can be submitted.  An
 54  * unused {@code ExecutorService} should be shut down to allow
 55  * reclamation of its resources.
 56  *
 57  * &lt;p&gt;Method {@code submit} extends base method {@link
 58  * Executor#execute(Runnable)} by creating and returning a {@link Future}
 59  * that can be used to cancel execution and/or wait for completion.
 60  * Methods {@code invokeAny} and {@code invokeAll} perform the most
 61  * commonly useful forms of bulk execution, executing a collection of
 62  * tasks and then waiting for at least one, or all, to
 63  * complete. (Class {@link ExecutorCompletionService} can be used to
 64  * write customized variants of these methods.)
 65  *
 66  * &lt;p&gt;The {@link Executors} class provides factory methods for the
 67  * executor services provided in this package.

 71  * Here is a sketch of a network service in which threads in a thread
 72  * pool service incoming requests. It uses the preconfigured {@link

 76  * class NetworkService implements Runnable {
 77  *   private final ServerSocket serverSocket;
 78  *   private final ExecutorService pool;
 79  *
 80  *   public NetworkService(int port, int poolSize)
 81  *       throws IOException {
 82  *     serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
 83  *     pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
 84  *   }
 85  *
 86  *   public void run() { // run the service
 87  *     try {
 88  *       for (;;) {
 89  *         pool.execute(new Handler(serverSocket.accept()));
