 38  * Base implementation class for interruptible channels.
 39  *
 40  * &lt;p&gt; This class encapsulates the low-level machinery required to implement
 41  * the asynchronous closing and interruption of channels.  A concrete channel
 42  * class must invoke the {@link #begin begin} and {@link #end end} methods
 43  * before and after, respectively, invoking an I/O operation that might block
 44  * indefinitely.  In order to ensure that the {@link #end end} method is always
 45  * invoked, these methods should be used within a
 46  * {@code try}&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;{@code finally} block:
 47  *
 48  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre id=&quot;be&quot;&gt;
 49  * boolean completed = false;
 50  * try {
 51  *     begin();
 52  *     completed = ...;    // Perform blocking I/O operation
</pre>
<hr />
<pre>
 67  * invoked while another thread is blocked in a native I/O operation upon the
 68  * channel then that operation will immediately return, either by throwing an
 69  * exception or by returning normally.  If a thread is interrupted or the
 70  * channel upon which it is blocked is asynchronously closed then the channel&#39;s
 71  * {@link #end end} method will throw the appropriate exception.
 72  *
 73  * &lt;p&gt; This class performs the synchronization required to implement the {@link
 74  * java.nio.channels.Channel} specification.  Implementations of the {@link
 75  * #implCloseChannel implCloseChannel} method need not synchronize against
 76  * other threads that might be attempting to close the channel.  &lt;/p&gt;
