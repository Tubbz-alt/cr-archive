   * an unmodifiable view collection is not necessarily immutable. However,
   * if the backing collection of an unmodifiable view is effectively immutable,
   * or if the only reference to the backing collection is through an
   * unmodifiable view, the view can be considered effectively immutable.

<span class="line-added">+  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;serializable&quot;&gt;Serializability of Collections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * &lt;p&gt;Serializability of collections is optional. As such, none of the collections</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * interfaces are declared to implement the {@link java.io.Serializable} interface.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * However, serializability is regarded as being generally useful, so most collection</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * implementations are serializable.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * &lt;p&gt;The collection implementations that are public classes (such as {@code ArrayList}</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * or {@code HashMap}) are declared to implement the {@code Serializable} interface if they</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * are in fact serializable. Some collections implementations are not public classes,</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * such as the &lt;a href=&quot;#unmodifiable&quot;&gt;unmodifiable collections.&lt;/a&gt; In such cases, the</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * serializability of such collections is described in the specification of the method</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * that creates them, or in some other suitable place. In cases where the serializability</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * of a collection is not specified, there is no guarantee about the serializability of such</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * collections. In particular, many &lt;a href=&quot;#view&quot;&gt;view collections&lt;/a&gt; are not serializable.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * &lt;p&gt;A collection implementation that implements the {@code Serializable} interface cannot</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * be guaranteed to be serializable. The reason is that in general, collections</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * contain elements of other types, and it is not possible to determine statically</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * whether instances of some element type are actually serializable. For example, consider</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * a serializable {@code Collection&lt;E&gt;}, where {@code E} does not implement the</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * {@code Serializable} interface. The collection may be serializable, if it contains only</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * elements of some serializable subtype of {@code E}, or if it is empty. Collections are</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * thus said to be &lt;i&gt;conditionally serializable,&lt;/i&gt; as the serializability of the collection</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * as a whole depends on whether the collection itself is serializable and on whether all</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * contained elements are also serializable.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * &lt;p&gt;An additional case occurs with instances of {@link SortedSet} and {@link SortedMap}.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * These collections can be created with a {@link Comparator} that imposes an ordering on</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * the set elements or map keys. Such a collection is serializable only if the provided</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * {@code Comparator} is also serializable.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *</span>
   * &lt;p&gt;This interface is a member of the
   * &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework&quot;&gt;
   * Java Collections Framework&lt;/a&gt;.
