   * &lt;p&gt; Resolution is the process of computing how modules depend on each other.
   * The process occurs at compile time and run time. &lt;/p&gt;
   *
   * &lt;p&gt; Resolution is a two-step process. The first step recursively enumerates
   * the &#39;requires&#39; directives of a set of root modules. If all the enumerated
   * modules are observable, then the second step computes their readability graph.
   * The readability graph embodies how modules depend on each other, which in
   * turn controls access across module boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;
   *
<span class="line-modified">!  * &lt;h2&gt; Step 1: Recursive enumeration &lt;/h2&gt;</span>
   *
   * &lt;p&gt; Recursive enumeration takes a set of module names, looks up each of their
   * module declarations, and for each module declaration, recursively enumerates:

   * &lt;p&gt; The set of root modules at compile-time is usually the set of modules
   * being compiled. At run-time, the set of root modules is usually the
   * application module specified to the &#39;java&#39; launcher. When compiling code in
   * the unnamed module, or at run-time when the main application class is loaded
   * from the class path, then the default set of root modules is implementation
   * specific. In the JDK the default set of root modules contains every module
   * that is observable on the upgrade module path or among the system modules,
   * and that exports at least one package without qualification. &lt;/p&gt;
   *
<span class="line-modified">!  * &lt;h2&gt; Observable modules &lt;/h2&gt;</span>
   *
   * &lt;p&gt; The set of observable modules at both compile-time and run-time is

   * the compiled modules built in to the environment. The search order is as
