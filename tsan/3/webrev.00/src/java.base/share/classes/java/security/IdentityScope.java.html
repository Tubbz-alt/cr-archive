 33  * &lt;p&gt;This class represents a scope for identities. It is an Identity
 34  * itself, and therefore has a name and can have a scope. It can also
 35  * optionally have a public key and associated certificates.
 36  *
 37  * &lt;p&gt;An IdentityScope can contain Identity objects of all kinds, including
 38  * Signers. All types of Identity objects can be retrieved, added, and
 39  * removed using the same methods. Note that it is possible, and in fact
 40  * expected, that different types of identity scopes will
 41  * apply different policies for their various operations on the
 42  * various types of Identities.
 43  *
 44  * &lt;p&gt;There is a one-to-one mapping between keys and identities, and
 45  * there can only be one copy of one key per scope. For example, suppose
 46  * &lt;b&gt;Acme Software, Inc&lt;/b&gt; is a software publisher known to a user.
 47  * Suppose it is an Identity, that is, it has a public key, and a set of
 48  * associated certificates. It is named in the scope using the name
 49  * &quot;Acme Software&quot;. No other named Identity in the scope has the same
 50  * public  key. Of course, none has the same name as well.
