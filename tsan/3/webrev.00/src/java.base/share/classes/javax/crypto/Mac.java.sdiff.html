 41  * This class provides the functionality of a &quot;Message Authentication Code&quot;
 42  * (MAC) algorithm.
 43  *
 44  * &lt;p&gt; A MAC provides a way to check
 45  * the integrity of information transmitted over or stored in an unreliable
 46  * medium, based on a secret key. Typically, message
 47  * authentication codes are used between two parties that share a secret
 48  * key in order to validate information transmitted between these
 49  * parties.
 50  *
 51  * &lt;p&gt; A MAC mechanism that is based on cryptographic hash functions is
 52  * referred to as HMAC. HMAC can be used with any cryptographic hash function,
 53  * e.g., SHA256 or SHA384, in combination with a secret shared key. HMAC is
 54  * specified in RFC 2104.
 55  *
 56  * &lt;p&gt; Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support
 57  * the following standard {@code Mac} algorithms:
 58  * &lt;ul&gt;
<span class="line-removed"> 59  * &lt;li&gt;{@code HmacMD5}&lt;/li&gt;</span>
 60  * &lt;li&gt;{@code HmacSHA1}&lt;/li&gt;
 61  * &lt;li&gt;{@code HmacSHA256}&lt;/li&gt;
 62  * &lt;/ul&gt;
 63  * These algorithms are described in the
 64  * &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/../specs/security/standard-names.html#mac-algorithms&quot;&gt;
 65  * Mac section&lt;/a&gt; of the
 66  * Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification.
 67  * Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any
 68  * other algorithms are supported.
