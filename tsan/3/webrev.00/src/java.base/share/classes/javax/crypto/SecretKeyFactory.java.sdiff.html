 38  * This class represents a factory for secret keys.
 39  *
 40  * &lt;P&gt; Key factories are used to convert &lt;I&gt;keys&lt;/I&gt; (opaque
 41  * cryptographic keys of type {@code Key}) into &lt;I&gt;key specifications&lt;/I&gt;
 42  * (transparent representations of the underlying key material), and vice
 43  * versa.
 44  * Secret key factories operate only on secret (symmetric) keys.
 45  *
 46  * &lt;P&gt; Key factories are bi-directional, i.e., they allow to build an opaque
 47  * key object from a given key specification (key material), or to retrieve
 48  * the underlying key material of a key object in a suitable format.
 49  *
 50  * &lt;P&gt; Application developers should refer to their provider&#39;s documentation
 51  * to find out which key specifications are supported by the
 52  * {@link #generateSecret(java.security.spec.KeySpec) generateSecret} and
 53  * {@link #getKeySpec(javax.crypto.SecretKey, java.lang.Class) getKeySpec}
 54  * methods.
<span class="line-modified"> 55  * For example, the DES secret-key factory supplied by the &quot;SunJCE&quot; provider</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 56  * supports {@code DESKeySpec} as a transparent representation of DES</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 57  * keys, and that provider&#39;s secret-key factory for Triple DES keys supports</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 58  * {@code DESedeKeySpec} as a transparent representation of Triple DES</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 59  * keys.</span>
 60  *
 61  * &lt;p&gt; Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
 62  * following standard {@code SecretKeyFactory} algorithms:
 63  * &lt;ul&gt;
<span class="line-removed"> 64  * &lt;li&gt;{@code DES}&lt;/li&gt;</span>
 65  * &lt;li&gt;{@code DESede}&lt;/li&gt;
 66  * &lt;/ul&gt;
 67  * These algorithms are described in the &lt;a href=
 68  * &quot;{@docRoot}/../specs/security/standard-names.html#secretkeyfactory-algorithms&quot;&gt;
 69  * SecretKeyFactory section&lt;/a&gt; of the
 70  * Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification.
 71  * Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any
 72  * other algorithms are supported.
