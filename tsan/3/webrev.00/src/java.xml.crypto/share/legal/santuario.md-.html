 51 
 52    &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
 53    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
 54    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

 58    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 59    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 60    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 61 
 62    &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 63    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 64    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 65    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 66    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 67    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 68    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 69 
 70    &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including

 72    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 73    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
 74    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
 75    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
 76    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
 77    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
 78    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

 83 
 84    &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 85    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 86    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 88 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 89    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 90    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 91    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 92    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 93    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 94 
 95 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 96    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 97    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 98    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 99    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
100    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
101    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
102    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
103    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
104    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
105    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
106    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
107    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
108    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
109    as of the date such litigation is filed.
110 
111 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
112    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
113    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
114    meet the following conditions:
115 
116    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
117        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
118 
119    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
120        stating that You changed the files; and
121 
122    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
123        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
124        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
125        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
126        the Derivative Works; and
127 
128    (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
129        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
130        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
131        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
132        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
133        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
134        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
135        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
136        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
137        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
138        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
139        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
140        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
141        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
142        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
143        as modifying the License.
144 
145    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
146    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
147    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
148    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
149    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
150    the conditions stated in this License.
151 
152 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
153    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
154    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
155    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
156    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
157    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
158    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
159 
160 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
161    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
162    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
163    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
164 
165 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
166    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
167    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
168    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
169    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
170    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
171    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
172    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
173    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
174 
175 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
176    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
177    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
178    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
179    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
180    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
181    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
182    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
183    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
184    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
185    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
186 
187 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
188    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
189    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
190    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
191    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
192    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
193    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
194    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
195    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
196    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
