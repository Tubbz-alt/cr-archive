118    as of the date such litigation is filed.

120 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
121    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
122    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
123    meet the following conditions:
124 
125    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
126        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
127 
128    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
129        stating that You changed the files; and
130 
131    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
132        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
133        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
134        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
135        the Derivative Works; and
136 
137    (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
138        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
139        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
140        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
141        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
142        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
143        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
144        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
145        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
146        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
147        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
148        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
149        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
150        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
151        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
152        as modifying the License.
153 
154    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
155    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
156    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
157    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
158    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
159    the conditions stated in this License.
160 
161 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
162    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
163    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
164    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
165    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
166    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
167    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
168 
169 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
170    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
171    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
172    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
173 
174 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
175    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
176    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
177    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
178    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
179    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
180    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
181    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
182    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
183 
184 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
185    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
186    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
187    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
188    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
189    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
190    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
191    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
192    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
193    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
194    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
195 
196 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
197    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
198    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
199    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
200    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
201    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
202    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
203    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
204    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
205    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
