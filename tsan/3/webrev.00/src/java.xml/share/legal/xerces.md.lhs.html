 53 
 54    &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
 55    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
 56    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

 58 
 59    &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
 60    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 61    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 62    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 63 
 64    &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 65    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 66    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 67    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 68    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 69    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 70    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 71 
 72    &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
 73    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
 74    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 75    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
 76    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
 77    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
 78    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
 79    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
 80    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

 85 
 86    &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 87    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 88    subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 89 
 90 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 91    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 92    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 93    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 94    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 95    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 96 
 97 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 98    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 99    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
100    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
101    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
102    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
103    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
104    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
105    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
106    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
107    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
108    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
109    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
110    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
111    as of the date such litigation is filed.
112 
113 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
114    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
115    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
116    meet the following conditions:
117 
118    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
119        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
120 
121    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
122        stating that You changed the files; and
123 
124    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
125        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
126        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
127        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
128        the Derivative Works; and
129 
130    (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
131        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
132        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
133        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
134        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
135        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
136        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
137        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
138        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
139        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
140        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
141        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
142        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
143        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
144        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
145        as modifying the License.
146 
147    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
148    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
149    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
150    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
151    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
152    the conditions stated in this License.
153 
154 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
155    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
156    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
157    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
158    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
159    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
160    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
161 
162 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
163    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
164    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
165    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
166 
167 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
168    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
169    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
170    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
171    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
172    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
173    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
174    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
175    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
176 
177 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
178    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
179    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
180    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
181    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
182    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
183    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
184    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
185    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
186    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
187    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
188 
189 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
190    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
191    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
192    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
193    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
194    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
195    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
196    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
197    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
198    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
