 48 
 49    &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
 50    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
 51    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

 53 
 54    &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
 55    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 56    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 57    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 58 
 59    &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 60    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 61    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 62    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 63    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 64    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 65    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 66 
 67    &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
 68    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
 69    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 70    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
 71    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
 72    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
 73    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
 74    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
 75    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
 76    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
 77    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

 80 
 81    &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 82    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 83    subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 84 
 85 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 86    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 87    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 88    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 89    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 90    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 91 
 92 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 93    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 94    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 95    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 96    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 97    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 98    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 99    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
100    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
101    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
102    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
103    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
104    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
105    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
106    as of the date such litigation is filed.
107 
108 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
109    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
110    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
111    meet the following conditions:
112 
113    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
114        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
115 
116    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
117        stating that You changed the files; and
118 
119    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
120        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
121        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
122        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
123        the Derivative Works; and
124 
125    (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
126        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
127        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
128        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
129        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
130        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
131        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
132        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
133        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
134        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
135        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
136        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
137        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
138        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
139        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
140        as modifying the License.
141 
142    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
143    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
144    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
145    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
146    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
147    the conditions stated in this License.
148 
149 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
150    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
151    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
152    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
153    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
154    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
155    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
156 
157 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
158    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
159    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
160    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
161 
162 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
163    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
164    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
165    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
166    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
167    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
168    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
169    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
170    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
171 
172 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
173    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
174    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
175    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
176    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
177    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
178    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
179    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
180    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
181    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
182    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
183 
184 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
185    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
186    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
187    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
188    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
189    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
190    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
191    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
192    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
193    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
