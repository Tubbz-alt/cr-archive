  * <p>This class is designed to sit between an {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader
  * XMLReader} and the client application's event handlers.  By default, it
  * does nothing but pass requests up to the reader and events
  * on to the handlers unmodified, but subclasses can override
  * specific methods to modify the event stream or the configuration
