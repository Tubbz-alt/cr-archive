30  * Interface for an XML filter.
31  *
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a>






32  * &lt;p&gt;An XML filter is like an XML reader, except that it obtains its
33  * events from another XML reader rather than a primary source like
34  * an XML document or database.  Filters can modify a stream of
35  * events as they pass on to the final application.&lt;/p&gt;
36  *
37  * &lt;p&gt;The XMLFilterImpl helper class provides a convenient base
38  * for creating SAX2 filters, by passing on all {@link org.xml.sax.EntityResolver
39  * EntityResolver}, {@link org.xml.sax.DTDHandler DTDHandler},
40  * {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler ContentHandler} and {@link org.xml.sax.ErrorHandler
41  * ErrorHandler} events automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
42  *
43  * @since 1.4, SAX 2.0
