 42  * Extended interface for mapping external entity references to input
 43  * sources, or providing a missing external subset.  The
 44  * {@link XMLReader#setEntityResolver XMLReader.setEntityResolver()} method
 45  * is used to provide implementations of this interface to parsers.
 46  * When a parser uses the methods in this interface, the
 47  * {@link EntityResolver2#resolveEntity EntityResolver2.resolveEntity()}
 48  * method (in this interface) is used &lt;em&gt;instead of&lt;/em&gt; the older (SAX 1.0)
 49  * {@link EntityResolver#resolveEntity EntityResolver.resolveEntity()} method.
 50  *
 51  * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 52  * &lt;em&gt;This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 53  * Public Domain, and comes with &lt;strong&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
 54  * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 55  *
 56  * &lt;p&gt;If a SAX application requires the customized handling which this
 57  * interface defines for external entities, it must ensure that it uses
 58  * an XMLReader with the
 59  * &lt;em&gt;http://xml.org/sax/features/use-entity-resolver2&lt;/em&gt; feature flag
 60  * set to &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; (which is its default value when the feature is
 61  * recognized).  If that flag is unrecognized, or its value is false,
 62  * or the resolver does not implement this interface, then only the
 63  * {@link EntityResolver} method will be used.
 64  *
 65  * &lt;p&gt;That supports three categories of application that modify entity
 66  * resolution.  &lt;em&gt;Old Style&lt;/em&gt; applications won&#39;t know about this interface;
 67  * they will provide an EntityResolver.
 68  * &lt;em&gt;Transitional Mode&lt;/em&gt; provide an EntityResolver2 and automatically
 69  * get the benefit of its methods in any systems (parsers or other tools)
 70  * supporting it, due to polymorphism.
 71  * Both &lt;em&gt;Old Style&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Transitional Mode&lt;/em&gt; applications will
 72  * work with any SAX2 parser.
 73  * &lt;em&gt;New style&lt;/em&gt; applications will fail to run except on SAX2 parsers
 74  * that support this particular feature.
 75  * They will insist that feature flag have a value of &quot;true&quot;, and the
 76  * EntityResolver2 implementation they provide  might throw an exception
 77  * if the original SAX 1.0 style entity resolution method is invoked.

 87      * Allows applications to provide an external subset for documents
 88      * that don&#39;t explicitly define one.  Documents with DOCTYPE declarations
 89      * that omit an external subset can thus augment the declarations
 90      * available for validation, entity processing, and attribute processing
 91      * (normalization, defaulting, and reporting types including ID).
 92      * This augmentation is reported
 93      * through the {@link LexicalHandler#startDTD startDTD()} method as if
 94      * the document text had originally included the external subset;
 95      * this callback is made before any internal subset data or errors
 96      * are reported.
 97      *
 98      * &lt;p&gt;This method can also be used with documents that have no DOCTYPE
 99      * declaration.  When the root element is encountered,
100      * but no DOCTYPE declaration has been seen, this method is
101      * invoked.  If it returns a value for the external subset, that root
102      * element is declared to be the root element, giving the effect of
103      * splicing a DOCTYPE declaration at the end the prolog of a document
104      * that could not otherwise be valid.  The sequence of parser callbacks
105      * in that case logically resembles this:
106      *
107      * &lt;pre&gt;
108      * ... comments and PIs from the prolog (as usual)
109      * startDTD (&quot;rootName&quot;, source.getPublicId (), source.getSystemId ());
110      * startEntity (&quot;[dtd]&quot;);
111      * ... declarations, comments, and PIs from the external subset
112      * endEntity (&quot;[dtd]&quot;);
113      * endDTD ();
114      * ... then the rest of the document (as usual)
115      * startElement (..., &quot;rootName&quot;, ...);
116      * &lt;/pre&gt;
117      *
118      * &lt;p&gt;Note that the InputSource gets no further resolution.
119      * Implementations of this method may wish to invoke
120      * {@link #resolveEntity resolveEntity()} to gain benefits such as use
121      * of local caches of DTD entities.  Also, this method will never be
122      * used by a (non-validating) processor that is not including external
123      * parameter entities.
124      *
125      * &lt;p&gt;Uses for this method include facilitating data validation when
126      * interoperating with XML processors that would always require
127      * undesirable network accesses for external entities, or which for
128      * other reasons adopt a &quot;no DTDs&quot; policy.
129      * Non-validation motives include forcing documents to include DTDs so
130      * that attributes are handled consistently.
131      * For example, an XPath processor needs to know which attibutes have
132      * type &quot;ID&quot; before it can process a widely used type of reference.
133      *
134      * &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Returning an external subset modifies
135      * the input document.  By providing definitions for general entities,
136      * it can make a malformed document appear to be well formed.
137      *

139      *  from a DOCTYPE declaration (where available) or from the actual
140      *  root element.
141      * @param baseURI The document&#39;s base URI, serving as an additional
142      *  hint for selecting the external subset.  This is always an absolute
143      *  URI, unless it is null because the XMLReader was given an InputSource
144      *  without one.
