27  * Provides interfaces to SAX2 facilities that
28  * conformant SAX drivers won&#39;t necessarily support.

<span class="line-removed">30  * &lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="line-removed">31  * See &lt;a target=&#39;_top&#39; href=&#39;http://www.saxproject.org&#39;&gt;http://www.saxproject.org&lt;/a&gt;</span>

33  *
34  * &lt;p&gt;
35  * This package is independent of the SAX2 core, though the functionality
36  * exposed generally needs to be implemented within a parser core.
37  * That independence has several consequences:
38  *
39  * &lt;ul&gt;
40  *
41  * &lt;li&gt;SAX2 drivers are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; required to recognize these handlers.
42  * &lt;/li&gt;
43  *
44  * &lt;li&gt;You cannot assume that the class files will be present in every SAX2
45  * installation.&lt;/li&gt;
46  *
47  * &lt;li&gt;This package may be updated independently of SAX2 (i.e. new
48  * handlers and classes may be added without updating SAX2 itself).&lt;/li&gt;
49  *
50  * &lt;li&gt;The new handlers are not implemented by the SAX2
51  * &lt;code&gt;org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler&lt;/code&gt; or
52  * &lt;code&gt;org.xml.sax.helpers.XMLFilterImpl&lt;/code&gt; classes.
53  * You can subclass these if you need such behavior, or
54  * use the helper classes found here.&lt;/li&gt;
55  *
56  * &lt;li&gt;The handlers need to be registered differently than core SAX2
57  * handlers.&lt;/li&gt;
58  *
59  * &lt;/ul&gt;
60  *
61  * &lt;p&gt;This package, SAX2-ext, is a standardized extension to SAX2.  It is
62  * designed both to allow SAX parsers to pass certain types of information
63  * to applications, and to serve as a simple model for other SAX2 parser
64  * extension packages.  Not all such extension packages should need to
65  * be recognized directly by parsers, however.
66  * As an example, most validation systems can be cleanly layered on top
67  * of parsers supporting the standardized SAX2 interfaces.
68  *
