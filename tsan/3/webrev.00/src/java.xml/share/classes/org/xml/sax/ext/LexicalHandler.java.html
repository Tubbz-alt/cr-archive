 31  * SAX2 extension handler for lexical events.
 32  *
 33  * &lt;p&gt;This is an optional extension handler for SAX2 to provide
 34  * lexical information about an XML document, such as comments
 35  * and CDATA section boundaries.
 36  * XML readers are not required to recognize this handler, and it
 37  * is not part of core-only SAX2 distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
 38  *
 39  * &lt;p&gt;The events in the lexical handler apply to the entire document,
 40  * not just to the document element, and all lexical handler events
 41  * must appear between the content handler&#39;s startDocument and
 42  * endDocument events.&lt;/p&gt;
 43  *
 44  * &lt;p&gt;To set the LexicalHandler for an XML reader, use the
 45  * {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader#setProperty setProperty} method
 46  * with the property name
 47  * &lt;code&gt;http://xml.org/sax/properties/lexical-handler&lt;/code&gt;
 48  * and an object implementing this interface (or null) as the value.
 49  * If the reader does not report lexical events, it will throw a
 50  * {@link org.xml.sax.SAXNotRecognizedException SAXNotRecognizedException}
 51  * when you attempt to register the handler.&lt;/p&gt;
 52  *
