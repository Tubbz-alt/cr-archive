 31  * &lt;p&gt;This was the main event-handling interface for SAX1; in
 32  * SAX2, it has been replaced by {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler
 33  * ContentHandler}, which provides Namespace support and reporting
 34  * of skipped entities.  This interface is included in SAX2 only
 35  * to support legacy SAX1 applications.&lt;/p&gt;
 36  *
 37  * &lt;p&gt;The order of events in this interface is very important, and
 38  * mirrors the order of information in the document itself.  For
 39  * example, all of an element&#39;s content (character data, processing
 40  * instructions, and/or subelements) will appear, in order, between
 41  * the startElement event and the corresponding endElement event.&lt;/p&gt;
 42  *
 43  * &lt;p&gt;Application writers who do not want to implement the entire
 44  * interface can derive a class from HandlerBase, which implements
 45  * the default functionality; parser writers can instantiate
 46  * HandlerBase to obtain a default handler.  The application can find
 47  * the location of any document event using the Locator interface
 48  * supplied by the Parser through the setDocumentLocator method.&lt;/p&gt;
 49  *
 50  * @deprecated This interface has been replaced by the SAX2
 51  *             {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler ContentHandler}
 52  *             interface, which includes Namespace support.
