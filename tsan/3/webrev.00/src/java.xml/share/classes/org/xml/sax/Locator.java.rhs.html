 30  * Interface for associating a SAX event with a document location.
 31  *
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a>






 32  * &lt;p&gt;If a SAX parser provides location information to the SAX
 33  * application, it does so by implementing this interface and then
 34  * passing an instance to the application using the content
 35  * handler&#39;s {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#setDocumentLocator
 36  * setDocumentLocator} method.  The application can use the
 37  * object to obtain the location of any other SAX event
 38  * in the XML source document.&lt;/p&gt;
 39  *
 40  * &lt;p&gt;Note that the results returned by the object will be valid only
 41  * during the scope of each callback method: the application
 42  * will receive unpredictable results if it attempts to use the
 43  * locator at any other time, or after parsing completes.&lt;/p&gt;
 44  *
 45  * &lt;p&gt;SAX parsers are not required to supply a locator, but they are
 46  * very strongly encouraged to do so.  If the parser supplies a
 47  * locator, it must do so before reporting any other document events.
 48  * If no locator has been set by the time the application receives
 49  * the {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#startDocument startDocument}
 50  * event, the application should assume that a locator is not
 51  * available.&lt;/p&gt;
 52  *
 53  * @since 1.4, SAX 1.0
