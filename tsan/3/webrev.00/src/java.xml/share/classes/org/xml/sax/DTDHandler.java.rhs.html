<a name="3" id="anc3"></a>






 31  * &lt;p&gt;If a SAX application needs information about notations and
 32  * unparsed entities, then the application implements this
 33  * interface and registers an instance with the SAX parser using
 34  * the parser&#39;s setDTDHandler method.  The parser uses the
 35  * instance to report notation and unparsed entity declarations to
 36  * the application.&lt;/p&gt;
 37  *
 38  * &lt;p&gt;Note that this interface includes only those DTD events that
 39  * the XML recommendation &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; processors to report:
 40  * notation and unparsed entity declarations.&lt;/p&gt;
 41  *
 42  * &lt;p&gt;The SAX parser may report these events in any order, regardless
 43  * of the order in which the notations and unparsed entities were
 44  * declared; however, all DTD events must be reported after the
 45  * document handler&#39;s startDocument event, and before the first
 46  * startElement event.
 47  * (If the {@link org.xml.sax.ext.LexicalHandler LexicalHandler} is
 48  * used, these events must also be reported before the endDTD event.)
 49  * &lt;/p&gt;
 50  *
 51  * &lt;p&gt;It is up to the application to store the information for
 52  * future use (perhaps in a hash table or object tree).
 53  * If the application encounters attributes of type &quot;NOTATION&quot;,
 54  * &quot;ENTITY&quot;, or &quot;ENTITIES&quot;, it can use the information that it
 55  * obtained through this interface to find the entity and/or
 56  * notation corresponding with the attribute value.&lt;/p&gt;
 57  *
 58  * @since 1.4, SAX 1.0
