 34  * Receive notification of general document events.

 37  * &lt;em&gt;This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 38  * Public Domain, and comes with &lt;strong&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
 39  * See &lt;a href=&#39;http://www.saxproject.org&#39;&gt;http://www.saxproject.org&lt;/a&gt;
 40  * for further information.
 41  * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 42  *
 43  * &lt;p&gt;This was the main event-handling interface for SAX1; in
 44  * SAX2, it has been replaced by {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler
 45  * ContentHandler}, which provides Namespace support and reporting
 46  * of skipped entities.  This interface is included in SAX2 only
 47  * to support legacy SAX1 applications.&lt;/p&gt;
 48  *
 49  * &lt;p&gt;The order of events in this interface is very important, and
 50  * mirrors the order of information in the document itself.  For
 51  * example, all of an element&#39;s content (character data, processing
 52  * instructions, and/or subelements) will appear, in order, between
 53  * the startElement event and the corresponding endElement event.&lt;/p&gt;
 54  *
 55  * &lt;p&gt;Application writers who do not want to implement the entire
 56  * interface can derive a class from HandlerBase, which implements
 57  * the default functionality; parser writers can instantiate
 58  * HandlerBase to obtain a default handler.  The application can find
 59  * the location of any document event using the Locator interface
 60  * supplied by the Parser through the setDocumentLocator method.&lt;/p&gt;
 61  *
 62  * @deprecated This interface has been replaced by the SAX2
 63  *             {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler ContentHandler}
 64  *             interface, which includes Namespace support.
