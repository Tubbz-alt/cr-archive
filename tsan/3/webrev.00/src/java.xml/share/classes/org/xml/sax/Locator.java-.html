 35  * Interface for associating a SAX event with a document location.
 36  *
 37  * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 38  * &lt;em&gt;This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 39  * Public Domain, and comes with &lt;strong&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
 40  * See &lt;a href=&#39;http://www.saxproject.org&#39;&gt;http://www.saxproject.org&lt;/a&gt;
 41  * for further information.
 42  * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 43  *
 44  * &lt;p&gt;If a SAX parser provides location information to the SAX
 45  * application, it does so by implementing this interface and then
 46  * passing an instance to the application using the content
 47  * handler&#39;s {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#setDocumentLocator
 48  * setDocumentLocator} method.  The application can use the
 49  * object to obtain the location of any other SAX event
 50  * in the XML source document.&lt;/p&gt;
 51  *
 52  * &lt;p&gt;Note that the results returned by the object will be valid only
 53  * during the scope of each callback method: the application
 54  * will receive unpredictable results if it attempts to use the
 55  * locator at any other time, or after parsing completes.&lt;/p&gt;
 56  *
 57  * &lt;p&gt;SAX parsers are not required to supply a locator, but they are
 58  * very strongly encouraged to do so.  If the parser supplies a
 59  * locator, it must do so before reporting any other document events.
 60  * If no locator has been set by the time the application receives
 61  * the {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#startDocument startDocument}
 62  * event, the application should assume that a locator is not
 63  * available.&lt;/p&gt;
 64  *
 65  * @since 1.4, SAX 1.0
