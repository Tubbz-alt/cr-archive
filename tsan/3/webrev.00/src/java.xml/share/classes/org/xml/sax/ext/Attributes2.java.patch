 /**
  * SAX2 extension to augment the per-attribute information
- * provided though {@link Attributes}.
+ * provided through {@link Attributes}.
  * If an implementation supports this extension, the attributes
  * provided in {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#startElement
  * ContentHandler.startElement() } will implement this interface,
  * and the <em>http://xml.org/sax/features/use-attributes2</em>
  * feature flag will have the value <em>true</em>.

  * <p> XMLReader implementations are not required to support this
  * information, and it is not part of core-only SAX2 distributions.</p>

  * <p>Note that if an attribute was defaulted (<em>!isSpecified()</em>)
  * it will of necessity also have been declared (<em>isDeclared()</em>)
