39  * &lt;em&gt;This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
40  * Public Domain, and comes with &lt;strong&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
41  * See &lt;a href=&#39;http://www.saxproject.org&#39;&gt;http://www.saxproject.org&lt;/a&gt;

44  *
45  * &lt;p&gt;An XML filter is like an XML reader, except that it obtains its
46  * events from another XML reader rather than a primary source like
47  * an XML document or database.  Filters can modify a stream of
48  * events as they pass on to the final application.&lt;/p&gt;
49  *
50  * &lt;p&gt;The XMLFilterImpl helper class provides a convenient base
51  * for creating SAX2 filters, by passing on all {@link org.xml.sax.EntityResolver
52  * EntityResolver}, {@link org.xml.sax.DTDHandler DTDHandler},
53  * {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler ContentHandler} and {@link org.xml.sax.ErrorHandler
54  * ErrorHandler} events automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
