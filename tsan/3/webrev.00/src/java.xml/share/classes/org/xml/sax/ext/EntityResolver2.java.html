 37  * Extended interface for mapping external entity references to input
 38  * sources, or providing a missing external subset.  The
 39  * {@link XMLReader#setEntityResolver XMLReader.setEntityResolver()} method
 40  * is used to provide implementations of this interface to parsers.
 41  * When a parser uses the methods in this interface, the
 42  * {@link EntityResolver2#resolveEntity EntityResolver2.resolveEntity()}
 43  * method (in this interface) is used &lt;em&gt;instead of&lt;/em&gt; the older (SAX 1.0)
 44  * {@link EntityResolver#resolveEntity EntityResolver.resolveEntity()} method.
 45  *
 46  * &lt;p&gt;If a SAX application requires the customized handling which this
 47  * interface defines for external entities, it must ensure that it uses
 48  * an XMLReader with the
 49  * &lt;em&gt;http://xml.org/sax/features/use-entity-resolver2&lt;/em&gt; feature flag
 50  * set to &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; (which is its default value when the feature is
 51  * recognized).  If that flag is unrecognized, or its value is false,
 52  * or the resolver does not implement this interface, then only the
 53  * {@link EntityResolver} method will be used.
 54  *
 55  * &lt;p&gt;That supports three categories of application that modify entity
 56  * resolution.  &lt;em&gt;Old Style&lt;/em&gt; applications won&#39;t know about this interface;
 57  * they will provide an EntityResolver.
 58  * &lt;em&gt;Transitional Mode&lt;/em&gt; provide an EntityResolver2 and automatically
 59  * get the benefit of its methods in any systems (parsers or other tools)
 60  * supporting it, due to polymorphism.
 61  * Both &lt;em&gt;Old Style&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Transitional Mode&lt;/em&gt; applications will
 62  * work with any SAX2 parser.
 63  * &lt;em&gt;New style&lt;/em&gt; applications will fail to run except on SAX2 parsers
 64  * that support this particular feature.
 65  * They will insist that feature flag have a value of &quot;true&quot;, and the
 66  * EntityResolver2 implementation they provide  might throw an exception
 67  * if the original SAX 1.0 style entity resolution method is invoked.
 68  *

 77      * Allows applications to provide an external subset for documents
 78      * that don&#39;t explicitly define one.  Documents with DOCTYPE declarations
 79      * that omit an external subset can thus augment the declarations
 80      * available for validation, entity processing, and attribute processing
 81      * (normalization, defaulting, and reporting types including ID).
 82      * This augmentation is reported
 83      * through the {@link LexicalHandler#startDTD startDTD()} method as if
 84      * the document text had originally included the external subset;
 85      * this callback is made before any internal subset data or errors
 86      * are reported.
 87      *
 88      * &lt;p&gt;This method can also be used with documents that have no DOCTYPE
 89      * declaration.  When the root element is encountered,
 90      * but no DOCTYPE declaration has been seen, this method is
 91      * invoked.  If it returns a value for the external subset, that root
 92      * element is declared to be the root element, giving the effect of
 93      * splicing a DOCTYPE declaration at the end the prolog of a document
 94      * that could not otherwise be valid.  The sequence of parser callbacks
 95      * in that case logically resembles this:
 96      *
 97      * &lt;pre&gt;
 98      * ... comments and PIs from the prolog (as usual)
 99      * startDTD (&quot;rootName&quot;, source.getPublicId (), source.getSystemId ());
100      * startEntity (&quot;[dtd]&quot;);
101      * ... declarations, comments, and PIs from the external subset
102      * endEntity (&quot;[dtd]&quot;);
103      * endDTD ();
104      * ... then the rest of the document (as usual)
105      * startElement (..., &quot;rootName&quot;, ...);
106      * &lt;/pre&gt;
107      *
108      * &lt;p&gt;Note that the InputSource gets no further resolution.
109      * Implementations of this method may wish to invoke
110      * {@link #resolveEntity resolveEntity()} to gain benefits such as use
111      * of local caches of DTD entities.  Also, this method will never be
112      * used by a (non-validating) processor that is not including external
113      * parameter entities.
114      *
115      * &lt;p&gt;Uses for this method include facilitating data validation when
116      * interoperating with XML processors that would always require
117      * undesirable network accesses for external entities, or which for
118      * other reasons adopt a &quot;no DTDs&quot; policy.
119      * Non-validation motives include forcing documents to include DTDs so
120      * that attributes are handled consistently.
121      * For example, an XPath processor needs to know which attibutes have
122      * type &quot;ID&quot; before it can process a widely used type of reference.
123      *
124      * &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Returning an external subset modifies
125      * the input document.  By providing definitions for general entities,
126      * it can make a malformed document appear to be well formed.

129      *  from a DOCTYPE declaration (where available) or from the actual
130      *  root element.
131      * @param baseURI The document&#39;s base URI, serving as an additional
132      *  hint for selecting the external subset.  This is always an absolute
133      *  URI, unless it is null because the XMLReader was given an InputSource
134      *  without one.
