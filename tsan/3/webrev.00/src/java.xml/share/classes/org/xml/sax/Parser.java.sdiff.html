 50  * and extensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
 51  *
 52  * &lt;p&gt;All SAX1 parsers must implement this basic interface: it allows
 53  * applications to register handlers for different types of events
 54  * and to initiate a parse from a URI, or a character stream.&lt;/p&gt;
 55  *
 56  * &lt;p&gt;All SAX1 parsers must also implement a zero-argument constructor
 57  * (though other constructors are also allowed).&lt;/p&gt;
 58  *
 59  * &lt;p&gt;SAX1 parsers are reusable but not re-entrant: the application
 60  * may reuse a parser object (possibly with a different input source)
 61  * once the first parse has completed successfully, but it may not
 62  * invoke the parse() methods recursively within a parse.&lt;/p&gt;
 63  *
 64  * @deprecated This interface has been replaced by the SAX2
 65  *             {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader XMLReader}
 66  *             interface, which includes Namespace support.
