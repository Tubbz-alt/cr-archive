201  * set the URI resolution for the transformation instructions or transformation

205  * found in the stylesheet instructions or built as part of the transformation
206  * process, and the base URI against which the first argument will be made absolute
207  * if the absolute URI is required.
208  * The returned {@link javax.xml.transform.Source} object must be usable by
209  * the transformer, as specified in its implemented features.
