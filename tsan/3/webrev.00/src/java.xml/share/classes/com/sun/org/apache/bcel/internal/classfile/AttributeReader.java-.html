38      When this attribute reader is added via the static method
39      Attribute.addAttributeReader, an attribute name is associated with it.

41      AttributeReaders based on the name of the attributes it is
42      constructing.
43 
44      @param name_index An index into the constant pool, indexing a
45      ConstantUtf8 that represents the name of the attribute.
46 
47      @param length The length of the data contained in the attribute.  This
48      is written into the constant pool and should agree with what the
49      factory expects the length to be.
50 
51      @param file This is the data input stream that the factory needs to read
52      its data from.

54      @param constant_pool This is the constant pool associated with the
55      Attribute that we are constructing.
56 
57      @return The user-defined AttributeReader should take this data and use
58      it to construct an attribute.  In the case of errors, a null can be
59      returned which will cause the parsing of the class file to fail.
