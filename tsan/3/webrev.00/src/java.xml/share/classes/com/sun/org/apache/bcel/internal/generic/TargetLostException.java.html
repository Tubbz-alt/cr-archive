25  * Thrown by InstructionList.remove() when one or multiple disposed instructions
26  * are still being referenced by an InstructionTargeter object. I.e. the
27  * InstructionTargeter has to be notified that (one of) the InstructionHandle it
28  * is referencing is being removed from the InstructionList and thus not valid anymore.
29  *
30  * &lt;p&gt;Making this an exception instead of a return value forces the user to handle
31  * these case explicitely in a try { ... } catch. The following code illustrates
32  * how this may be done:&lt;/p&gt;

40  *             for (InstructionTargeter targeter : target.getTargeters()) {
