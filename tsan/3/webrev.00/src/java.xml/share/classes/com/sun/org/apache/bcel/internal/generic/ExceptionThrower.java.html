25  * Denote an instruction that may throw a run-time or a linking
26  * exception (or both) during execution.  This is not quite the truth
27  * as such; because all instructions may throw an
28  * java.lang.VirtualMachineError. These exceptions are omitted.
29  *
30  * The Lava Language Specification specifies exactly which
31  * &lt;i&gt;RUN-TIME&lt;/i&gt; and which &lt;i&gt;LINKING&lt;/i&gt; exceptions each
32  * instruction may throw which is reflected by the implementers.  Due
33  * to the structure of the JVM specification, it may be possible that
34  * an Instruction implementing this interface returns a Class[] of
35  * size 0.
36  *
37  * Please note that we speak of an &quot;exception&quot; here when we mean any
38  * &quot;Throwable&quot; object; so this term is equally used for &quot;Exception&quot;
39  * and &quot;Error&quot; objects.
