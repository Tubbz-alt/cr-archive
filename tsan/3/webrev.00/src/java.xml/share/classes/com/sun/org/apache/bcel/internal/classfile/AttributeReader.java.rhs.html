40      AttributeReaders based on the name of the attributes it is
41      constructing.

43      @param name_index An index into the constant pool, indexing a

45 
46      @param length The length of the data contained in the attribute.  This
47      is written into the constant pool and should agree with what the
48      factory expects the length to be.

51      its data from.

57      it to construct an attribute.  In the case of errors, a null can be
58      returned which will cause the parsing of the class file to fail.
