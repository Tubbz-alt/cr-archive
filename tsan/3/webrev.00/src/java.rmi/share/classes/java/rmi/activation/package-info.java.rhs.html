27  * Provides support for RMI Object Activation.  A remote
28  * object&#39;s reference can be made ``persistent&#39;&#39; and later activated into a
29  * ``live&#39;&#39; object using the RMI activation mechanism.
30  *
31  * &lt;p&gt;Implementations are not required to support the activation
32  * mechanism. If activation is not supported by this implementation,
33  * several specific activation API methods are all required to throw
34  * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}. If activation is supported by this
35  * implementation, these methods must never throw {@code
36  * UnsupportedOperationException}. These methods are denoted by the
37  * presence of an entry for {@code UnsupportedOperationException} in the
38  * &lt;strong&gt;Throws&lt;/strong&gt; section of each method&#39;s specification.
39  *
