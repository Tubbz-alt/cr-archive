26 /**
27  * Provides the RMI package. RMI is Remote Method Invocation.  It is a
28  * mechanism that enables an object on one Java virtual machine to invoke
29  * methods on an object in another Java virtual machine.  Any object that
30  * can be invoked this way must implement the Remote interface. When such
31  * an object is invoked, its arguments are ``marshalled&#39;&#39; and sent from the
32  * local virtual machine to the remote one, where the arguments are
33  * ``unmarshalled.&#39;&#39;  When the method terminates, the results are
34  * marshalled from the remote machine and sent to the caller&#39;s virtual
35  * machine.  If the method invocation results in an exception being
36  * thrown, the exception is indicated to caller.
