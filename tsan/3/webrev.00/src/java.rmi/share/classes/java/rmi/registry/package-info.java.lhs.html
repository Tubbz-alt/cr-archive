26 /**
27  * Provides a class and two interfaces for the RMI registry.
28  * A registry is a remote object that maps names to remote objects.  A
29  * server registers its remote objects with the registry so that they can
30  * be looked up.  When an object wants to invoke a method on a remote
31  * object, it must first lookup the remote object using its name.  The
32  * registry returns to the calling object a reference to the remote
33  * object, using which a remote method can be invoked.
34  *
35  * @since 1.1
