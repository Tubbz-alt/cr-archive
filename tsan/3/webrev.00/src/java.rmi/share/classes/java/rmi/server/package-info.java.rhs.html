26 /**
27  * Provides classes and interfaces for supporting the server
28  * side of RMI.  A group of classes are used by the stubs and skeletons
29  * generated by the rmic stub compiler.  Another group of classes
30  * implements the RMI Transport protocol and HTTP tunneling.
31  *
32  * &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deprecated: HTTP Tunneling.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The HTTP tunneling
33  * mechanism has been deprecated. See {@link java.rmi.server.RMISocketFactory} for
34  * further information.&lt;/em&gt;
35  *
36  * &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deprecated: Skeletons and Static Stubs.&lt;/strong&gt;
37  *
38  * &lt;em&gt;Skeletons and statically generated stubs are deprecated.  This
39  * includes the APIs in this package that require the use of skeletons
40  * or static stubs, the runtime support for them, and the use of the
41  * {@code rmic} stub compiler to generate them.  Support for skeletons
42  * and static stubs may be removed in a future release of the
43  * platform. Skeletons are unnecessary, as server-side method dispatching
44  * is handled directly by the RMI runtime. Statically generated stubs are
45  * unnecessary, as stubs are generated dynamically using {@link
46  * java.lang.reflect.Proxy Proxy} objects. See {@link
47  * java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject UnicastRemoteObject} for
48  * information about dynamic stub generation. Generation of skeletons and
49  * static stubs was typically performed as part of an application&#39;s build
50  * process by calling the {@code rmic} tool. This is unnecessary, and
51  * calls to {@code rmic} can simply be omitted.&lt;/em&gt;
52  *
53  * @since 1.1
