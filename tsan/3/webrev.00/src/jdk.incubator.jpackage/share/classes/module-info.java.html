27  * Defines the Java Packaging tool, jpackage.
28  *
29  * &lt;p&gt;jpackage is a tool for generating self-contained application bundles.
30  *
31  * &lt;p&gt; This module provides the equivalent of command-line access to &lt;em&gt;jpackage&lt;/em&gt;
32  * via the {@link java.util.spi.ToolProvider ToolProvider} SPI.
33  * Instances of the tool can be obtained by calling
34  * {@link java.util.spi.ToolProvider#findFirst ToolProvider.findFirst}
35  * or the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader service loader} with the name
36  * {@code &quot;jpackage&quot;}.
37  *
38  * @implNote The {@code jpackage} tool is not thread-safe. An application
39  * should not call either of the
40  * {@link java.util.spi.ToolProvider ToolProvider} {@code run} methods
41  * concurrently, even with separate {@code &quot;jpackage&quot;} {@code ToolProvider}
42  * instances, or undefined behavior may result.
