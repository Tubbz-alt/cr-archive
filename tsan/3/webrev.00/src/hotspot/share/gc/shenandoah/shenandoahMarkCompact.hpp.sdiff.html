32  * This implements Full GC (e.g. when invoking System.gc()) using a mark-compact algorithm.
33  *
34  * Current implementation is parallel sliding Lisp-2-style algorithm, based on
35  * &quot;Parallel Garbage Collection for Shared Memory Multiprocessors&quot;, by Christine Flood et al.
36  * http://people.csail.mit.edu/shanir/publications/dfsz2001.pdf
37  *
38  * It is implemented in four phases:
39  *
40  * 1. Mark all live objects of the heap by traversing objects starting at GC roots.
41  * 2. Calculate the new location of each live object. This is done by sequentially scanning
42  *    the heap, keeping track of a next-location-pointer, which is then written to each
43  *    object&#39;s fwdptr field.
44  * 3. Update all references. This is implemented by another scan of the heap, and updates
45  *    all references in live objects by what&#39;s stored in the target object&#39;s fwdptr.
46  * 4. Compact the heap by copying all live objects to their new location.
47  *
48  * Parallelization is handled by assigning each GC worker the slice of the heap (the set of regions)
49  * where it does sliding compaction, without interfering with other threads.
