 49   // end of the collection. In the worst case the last PLAB could be completely
 50   // empty.
 51   // This allows us to calculate the new PLAB size to achieve the
 52   // TargetPLABWastePct given the latest memory usage and that the last buffer
 53   // will be G1LastPLABAverageOccupancy full.
 54   //
 55   // E.g. assume that if in the current GC 100 words were allocated and a
 56   // TargetPLABWastePct of 10 had been set.
 57   //
 58   // So we could waste up to 10 words to meet that percentage. Given that we
 59   // also assume that that buffer is typically half-full, the new desired PLAB
 60   // size is set to 20 words.
 61   //
 62   // The amount of allocation performed should be independent of the number of
 63   // threads, so should the maximum waste we can spend in total. So if
 64   // we used n threads to allocate, each of them can spend maximum waste/n words in
 65   // a first rough approximation. The number of threads only comes into play later
 66   // when actually retrieving the actual desired PLAB size.
 67   //
 68   // After calculating this optimal PLAB size the algorithm applies the usual
 69   // exponential decaying average over this value to guess the next PLAB size.
 70   //
 71   // We account region end waste fully to PLAB allocation (in the calculation of
 72   // what we consider as &quot;used_for_waste_calculation&quot; below). This is not
 73   // completely fair, but is a conservative assumption because PLABs may be sized
 74   // flexibly while we cannot adjust inline allocations.
 75   // Allocation during GC will try to minimize region end waste so this impact
 76   // should be minimal.
 77   //
 78   // We need to cover overflow when calculating the amount of space actually used
 79   // by objects in PLABs when subtracting the region end waste.
 80   // Region end waste may be higher than actual allocation. This may occur if many
 81   // threads do not allocate anything but a few rather large objects. In this
 82   // degenerate case the PLAB size would simply quickly tend to minimum PLAB size,
 83   // which is an okay reaction.
