33 // the same reason, the size of the data area is hard coded to

35 // needed, but avoid making it excessively large as it adds to
36 // the memory overhead of creating a thread.

41 // T, so that field offsets relative to Thread are small, which
42 // often allows for a more compact instruction encoding.
