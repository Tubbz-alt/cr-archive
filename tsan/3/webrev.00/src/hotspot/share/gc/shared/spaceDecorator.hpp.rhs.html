 41 // Functionality for use with class Space and class MutableSpace.
 42 //   The approach taken with the mangling is to mangle all
 43 // the space initially and then to mangle areas that have
 44 // been allocated since the last collection.  Mangling is
 45 // done in the context of a generation and in the context
 46 // of a space.
 47 //   The space in a generation is mangled when it is first
 48 // initialized and when the generation grows.  The spaces
 49 // are not necessarily up-to-date when this mangling occurs
 50 // and the method mangle_region() is used.
 51 //   After allocations have been done in a space, the space generally
 52 // need to be remangled.  Remangling is only done on the
 53 // recently allocated regions in the space.  Typically, that is
 54 // the region between the new top and the top just before a
 55 // garbage collection.
 56 //   An exception to the usual mangling in a space is done when the
 57 // space is used for an extraordinary purpose.  Specifically, when
 58 // to-space is used as scratch space for a mark-sweep-compact
 59 // collection.
 60 //   Spaces are mangled after a collection.  If the generation
 61 // grows after a collection, the added space is mangled as part of
 62 // the growth of the generation.  No additional mangling is needed when the
 63 // spaces are resized after an expansion.
 64 //   The class SpaceMangler keeps a pointer to the top of the allocated
 65 // area and provides the methods for doing the piece meal mangling.
 66 // Methods for doing sparces and full checking of the mangling are
 67 // included.  The full checking is done if DEBUG_MANGLING is defined.
 68 //   GenSpaceMangler is used with the GenCollectedHeap collectors and
 69 // MutableSpaceMangler is used with the ParallelScavengeHeap collectors.
 70 // These subclasses abstract the differences in the types of spaces used
 71 // by each heap.
