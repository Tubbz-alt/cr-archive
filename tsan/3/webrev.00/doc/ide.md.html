 1 % IDE support in the JDK
 2 
 3 ## Introduction
 4 
 5 When you are familiar with building and testing the JDK, you may want to
 6 configure an IDE to work with the source code. The instructions differ a bit
 7 depending on whether you are interested in working with the native (C/C++) or
 8 the Java code.
 9 
10 ### IDE support for native code
11 
12 There are a few ways to generate IDE configuration for the native sources,
13 depending on which IDE to use.
14 
15 #### Visual Studio Code
16 
17 The make system can generate a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
18 workspace that has C/C++ source indexing configured correctly, as well as
19 launcher targets for tests and the Java launcher. After configuring, a workspace
20 for the configuration can be generated using:
21 
22 ```shell
23 make vscode-project
24 ```
25 
26 This creates a file called `jdk.code-workspace` in the build output folder. The
27 full location will be printed after the workspace has been generated. To use it,
28 choose `File -&gt; Open Workspace...` in Visual Studio Code.
29 
30 ##### Alternative indexers
31 
32 The main `vscode-project` target configures the default C++ support in Visual
33 Studio Code. There are also other source indexers that can be installed, that
34 may provide additional features. It&#39;s currently possible to generate
35 configuration for two such indexers, [clangd](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd/)
36 and [rtags](https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags). These can be configured by
37 appending the name of the indexer to the make target, such as:
38 
39 ```shell
40 make vscode-project-clangd
41 ```
42 
43 Additional instructions for configuring the given indexer will be displayed
44 after the workspace has been generated.
45 
46 #### Visual Studio
47 
48 This section is a work in progress.
49 
50 ```shell
51 make ide-project
52 ```
53 
54 #### Compilation Database
55 
56 The make system can generate generic native code indexing support in the form of
57 a [Compilation Database](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html)
58 that can be used by many different IDEs and source code indexers.
59 
60 ```shell
61 make compile-commands
62 ```
63 
64 It&#39;s also possible to generate the Compilation Database for the HotSpot source
65 code only, which is a bit faster as it includes less information.
66 
67 ```shell
68 make compile-commands-hotspot
69 ```

71 ### IDE support for Java code
