 1 Everything in this directory is dedicated to building the EvilProvider
 2 used with the SecKeyFacSunJCEPRF test (JDK-8218723).
 3 
 4 The makefile does require a JDK image path to be provided through the
 5 JAVA_BASE makefile variable.  As an example:
 6 
 7 make JAVA_BASE=/usr/java/jdk-11.0.1 evilprov
 8 
 9 Since the EvilProvider is a modular jar, JDK 9 or later should be used.

11 For OpenJDK, no signing is required.  If signing is required (for use
12 with Oracle JDK, for instance), you must obtain a JCE signing certificate
13 and place it in a keystore, then run the &quot;signed&quot; makefile target (it will
14 build the jar file if it does not already exist).
