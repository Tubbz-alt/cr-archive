25  * @bug 8217375
26  * @summary This test runs those test cases of {@link Compatibility} test nearby
27  * which can be executed within the currently built and tested JDK and without
28  * TSA, with only one digest algorithm and with only one key (algorithm and
29  * size) and without delayed verification.
30  * Other test cases are to be executed manually invoking {@link Compatibility}
31  * involving more than the currently built and tested JDK verifying the
32  * compatibility of jarsigner across different JDK releases.
33  * For more details about the test and its usages, please look at the README.
