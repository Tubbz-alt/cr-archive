  34 # Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
  35 # Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
  36 # San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
  37 # Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
  38 #
  39 # Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
  40 # for time zone data was the International Air Transport
  41 # Association&#39;s Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
  42 # published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
  43 # of the IATA&#39;s data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
  44 # IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
  45 #
  46 # A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
  47 # Derek Howse, Greenwich time and longitude, Philip Wilson Publishers (1997).
  48 #
  49 # Except where otherwise noted, Shanks &amp; Pottenger is the source for

 125 # Britain (United Kingdom) and Ireland (Eire)
 126 
 127 # From Peter Ilieve (1994-07-06):
 128 #
 129 # On 17 Jan 1994 the Independent, a UK quality newspaper, had a piece about
 130 # historical vistas along the Thames in west London. There was a photo
 131 # and a sketch map showing some of the sightlines involved. One paragraph
 132 # of the text said:
 133 #
 134 # &#39;An old stone obelisk marking a forgotten terrestrial meridian stands
 135 # beside the river at Kew. In the 18th century, before time and longitude
 136 # was standardised by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, scholars observed
 137 # this stone and the movement of stars from Kew Observatory nearby. They
 138 # made their calculations and set the time for the Horse Guards and Parliament,
 139 # but now the stone is obscured by scrubwood and can only be seen by walking
 140 # along the towpath within a few yards of it.&#39;
 141 #
 142 # I have a one inch to one mile map of London and my estimate of the stone&#39;s
 143 # position is 51° 28&#39; 30&quot; N, 0° 18&#39; 45&quot; W. The longitude should
 144 # be within about ±2&quot;. The Ordnance Survey grid reference is TQ172761.
 145 #
 146 # [This yields GMTOFF = -0:01:15 for London LMT in the 18th century.]
 147 
 148 # From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
 149 #
 150 # Howse writes that Britain was the first country to use standard time.
 151 # The railways cared most about the inconsistencies of local mean time,
 152 # and it was they who forced a uniform time on the country.
 153 # The original idea was credited to Dr. William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828)
 154 # and was popularized by Abraham Follett Osler (1808-1903).
 155 # The first railway to adopt London time was the Great Western Railway
 156 # in November 1840; other railways followed suit, and by 1847 most
 157 # (though not all) railways used London time.  On 1847-09-22 the
 158 # Railway Clearing House, an industry standards body, recommended that GMT be
 159 # adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it.
 160 # The transition occurred on 12-01 for the L&amp;NW, the Caledonian,
 161 # and presumably other railways; the January 1848 Bradshaw&#39;s lists many
 162 # railways as using GMT.  By 1855 the vast majority of public
 163 # clocks in Britain were set to GMT (though some, like the great clock
 164 # on Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, were fitted with two minute hands,
 165 # one for local time and one for GMT).  The last major holdout was the legal
 166 # system, which stubbornly stuck to local time for many years, leading
 167 # to oddities like polls opening at 08:13 and closing at 16:13.
 168 # The legal system finally switched to GMT when the Statutes (Definition
 169 # of Time) Act took effect; it received the Royal Assent on 1880-08-02.
 170 #
 171 # In the tables below, we condense this complicated story into a single
 172 # transition date for London, namely 1847-12-01.  We don&#39;t know as much
 173 # about Dublin, so we use 1880-08-02, the legal transition time.
 174 
 175 # From Paul Eggert (2014-07-19):
 176 # The ancients had no need for daylight saving, as they kept time
 177 # informally or via hours whose length depended on the time of year.
 178 # Daylight saving time in its modern sense was invented by the
 179 # New Zealand entomologist George Vernon Hudson (1867-1946),
 180 # whose day job as a postal clerk led him to value
 181 # after-hours daylight in which to pursue his research.
 182 # In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society
 183 # that proposed a two-hour daylight-saving shift.  See:
 184 # Hudson GV. On seasonal time-adjustment in countries south of lat. 30°.
 185 # Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute. 1895;28:734
 186 # http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_28/rsnz_28_00_006110.html
 187 # Although some interest was expressed in New Zealand, his proposal
 188 # did not find its way into law and eventually it was almost forgotten.
 189 #
 190 # In England, DST was independently reinvented by William Willett (1857-1915),
 191 # a London builder and member of the Royal Astronomical Society
 192 # who circulated a pamphlet &quot;The Waste of Daylight&quot; (1907)
 193 # that proposed advancing clocks 20 minutes on each of four Sundays in April,
 194 # and retarding them by the same amount on four Sundays in September.
 195 # A bill was drafted in 1909 and introduced in Parliament several times,
 196 # but it met with ridicule and opposition, especially from farming interests.
 197 # Later editions of the pamphlet proposed one-hour summer time, and
 198 # it was eventually adopted as a wartime measure in 1916.
 199 # See: Summer Time Arrives Early, The Times (2000-05-18).
 200 # A monument to Willett was unveiled on 1927-05-21, in an open space in
 201 # a 45-acre wood near Chislehurst, Kent that was purchased by popular
 202 # subscription and open to the public.  On the south face of the monolith,
 203 # designed by G. W. Miller, is the William Willett Memorial Sundial,
 204 # which is permanently set to Summer Time.
 205 
 206 # From Winston Churchill (1934-04-28):
 207 # It is one of the paradoxes of history that we should owe the boon of
 208 # summer time, which gives every year to the people of this country
 209 # between 160 and 170 hours more daylight leisure, to a war which
 210 # plunged Europe into darkness for four years, and shook the
 211 # foundations of civilization throughout the world.

 215 
 216 # From Paul Eggert (2015-08-08):
 217 # The OED Supplement says that the English originally said &quot;Daylight Saving&quot;
 218 # when they were debating the adoption of DST in 1908; but by 1916 this
 219 # term appears only in quotes taken from DST&#39;s opponents, whereas the
 220 # proponents (who eventually won the argument) are quoted as using &quot;Summer&quot;.
 221 # The term &quot;Summer Time&quot; was introduced by Herbert Samuel, Home Secretary; see:
 222 # Viscount Samuel. Leisure in a Democracy. Cambridge University Press
 223 # ISBN 978-1-107-49471-8 (1949, reissued 2015), p 8.
 224 
 225 # From Arthur David Olson (1989-01-19):
 226 # A source at the British Information Office in New York avers that it&#39;s
 227 # known as &quot;British&quot; Summer Time in all parts of the United Kingdom.
 228 
 229 # Date: 4 Jan 89 08:57:25 GMT (Wed)
 230 # From: Jonathan Leffler
 231 # [British Summer Time] is fixed annually by Act of Parliament.
 232 # If you can predict what Parliament will do, you should be in
 233 # politics making a fortune, not computing.
 234 
 235 # From Chris Carrier (1996-06-14):
 236 # I remember reading in various wartime issues of the London Times the
 237 # acronym BDST for British Double Summer Time.  Look for the published
 238 # time of sunrise and sunset in The Times, when BDST was in effect, and
 239 # if you find a zone reference it will say, &quot;All times B.D.S.T.&quot;
 240 
 241 # From Joseph S. Myers (1999-09-02):
 242 # ... some military cables (WO 219/4100 - this is a copy from the
 243 # main SHAEF archives held in the US National Archives, SHAEF/5252/8/516)
 244 # agree that the usage is BDST (this appears in a message dated 17 Feb 1945).
 245 
 246 # From Joseph S. Myers (2000-10-03):
 247 # On 18th April 1941, Sir Stephen Tallents of the BBC wrote to Sir
 248 # Alexander Maxwell of the Home Office asking whether there was any
 249 # official designation; the reply of the 21st was that there wasn&#39;t
 250 # but he couldn&#39;t think of anything better than the &quot;Double British
 251 # Summer Time&quot; that the BBC had been using informally.

 253 # https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/ho-19410421.png
 254 
 255 # From Sir Alexander Maxwell in the above-mentioned letter (1941-04-21):
 256 # [N]o official designation has as far as I know been adopted for the time
 257 # which is to be introduced in May....
 258 # I cannot think of anything better than &quot;Double British Summer Time&quot;
 259 # which could not be said to run counter to any official description.
 260 
 261 # From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
 262 # Howse writes (p 157) &#39;DBST&#39; too, but &#39;BDST&#39; seems to have been common
 263 # and follows the more usual convention of putting the location name first,
 264 # so we use &#39;BDST&#39;.
 265 
 266 # Peter Ilieve (1998-04-19) described at length
 267 # the history of summer time legislation in the United Kingdom.
 268 # Since 1998 Joseph S. Myers has been updating
 269 # and extending this list, which can be found in
 270 # https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/
 271 
 272 # From Joseph S. Myers (1998-01-06):
 273 #
 274 # The legal time in the UK outside of summer time is definitely GMT, not UTC;
 275 # see Lord Tanlaw&#39;s speech
 276 # https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo970611/text/70611-10.htm#70611-10_head0
 277 # (Lords Hansard 11 June 1997 columns 964 to 976).
 278 
 279 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
 280 #
 281 # For lack of other data, follow Shanks &amp; Pottenger for Eire in 1940-1948.
 282 #
 283 # Given Ilieve and Myers&#39;s data, the following claims by Shanks &amp; Pottenger
 284 # are incorrect:
 285 #     * Wales did not switch from GMT to daylight saving time until
 286 #	1921 Apr 3, when they began to conform with the rest of Great Britain.
 287 # Actually, Wales was identical after 1880.
 288 #     * Eire had two transitions on 1916 Oct 1.
 289 # It actually just had one transition.
 290 #     * Northern Ireland used single daylight saving time throughout WW II.
 291 # Actually, it conformed to Britain.
 292 #     * GB-Eire changed standard time to 1 hour ahead of GMT on 1968-02-18.
 293 # Actually, that date saw the usual switch to summer time.
 294 # Standard time was not changed until 1968-10-27 (the clocks didn&#39;t change).
 295 #
 296 # Here is another incorrect claim by Shanks &amp; Pottenger:
 297 #     * Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man did not switch from GMT
 298 #	to daylight saving time until 1921 Apr 3, when they began to
 299 #	conform with Great Britain.
 300 # S.R.&amp;O. 1916, No. 382 and HO 45/10811/312364 (quoted above) say otherwise.
 301 #
 302 # The following claim by Shanks &amp; Pottenger is possible though doubtful;
 303 # we&#39;ll ignore it for now.
 304 #     * Dublin&#39;s 1971-10-31 switch was at 02:00, even though London&#39;s was 03:00.
 305 
 306 # From Paul Eggert (2017-12-04):
 307 #
 308 # Dunsink Observatory (8 km NW of Dublin&#39;s center) was to Dublin as
 309 # Greenwich was to London.  For example:
 310 #
 311 #   &quot;Timeball on the ballast office is down.  Dunsink time.&quot;
 312 #   -- James Joyce, Ulysses
 313 #
 314 # The abbreviation DMT stood for &quot;Dublin Mean Time&quot; or &quot;Dunsink Mean Time&quot;;
 315 # this being Ireland, opinions differed.
 316 #
 317 # Whitman says Dublin/Dunsink Mean Time was UT-00:25:21, which agrees
 318 # with measurements of recent visitors to the Meridian Room of Dunsink
 319 # Observatory; see Malone D. Dunsink and timekeeping. 2016-01-24.
 320 # &lt;https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwmalone/time/dunsink.html&gt;.  Malone
 321 # writes that the Nautical Almanac listed UT-00:25:22 until 1896, when
 322 # it moved to UT-00:25:21.1 (I confirmed that the 1893 edition used
 323 # the former and the 1896 edition used the latter).  Evidently the
 324 # news of this change propagated slowly, as Milne 1899 still lists
 325 # UT-00:25:22 and cites the International Telegraph Bureau.  As it is
 326 # not clear that there was any practical significance to the change
 327 # from UT-00:25:22 to UT-00:25:21.1 in civil timekeeping, omit this
 328 # transition for now and just use the latter value, omitting its
 329 # fraction since our format cannot represent fractions.
 330 
 331 # &quot;Countess Markievicz ... claimed that the [1916] abolition of Dublin Mean Time
 332 # was among various actions undertaken by the &#39;English&#39; government that
 333 # would &#39;put the whole country into the SF (Sinn Féin) camp&#39;.  She claimed
 334 # Irish &#39;public feeling (was) outraged by forcing of English time on us&#39;.&quot;

 360 # should allow various updates to the comments in the europe file to cover
 361 # the laws applicable in Ireland.)
 362 #
 363 # (Note that the time in the Republic of Ireland since 1968 has been defined
 364 # in terms of standard time being GMT+1 with a period of winter time when it
 365 # is GMT, rather than standard time being GMT with a period of summer time
 366 # being GMT+1.)

 368 # From Paul Eggert (1999-03-28):
 369 # Clive Feather (&lt;news:859845706.26043.0@office.demon.net&gt;, 1997-03-31)
 370 # reports that Folkestone (Cheriton) Shuttle Terminal uses Concession Time
 371 # (CT), equivalent to French civil time.
 372 # Julian Hill (&lt;news:36118128.5A14@virgin.net&gt;, 1998-09-30) reports that
 373 # trains between Dollands Moor (the freight facility next door)
 374 # and Frethun run in CT.
 375 # My admittedly uninformed guess is that the terminal has two authorities,
 376 # the French concession operators and the British civil authorities,
 377 # and that the time depends on who you&#39;re talking to.
 378 # If, say, the British police were called to the station for some reason,
 379 # I would expect the official police report to use GMT/BST and not CET/CEST.
 380 # This is a borderline case, but for now let&#39;s stick to GMT/BST.
 381 
 382 # From an anonymous contributor (1996-06-02):
 383 # The law governing time in Ireland is under Statutory Instrument SI 395/94,
 384 # which gives force to European Union 7th Council Directive No. 94/21/EC.
 385 # Under this directive, the Minister for Justice in Ireland makes appropriate
 386 # regulations. I spoke this morning with the Secretary of the Department of
 387 # Justice (tel +353 1 678 9711) who confirmed to me that the correct name is
 388 # &quot;Irish Summer Time&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;IST&quot;.
 389 #
 390 # From Paul Eggert (2017-12-07):
 391 # The 1996 anonymous contributor&#39;s goal was to determine the correct
 392 # abbreviation for summer time in Dublin and so the contributor
 393 # focused on the &quot;IST&quot;, not on the &quot;Irish Summer Time&quot;.  Though the
 394 # &quot;IST&quot; was correct, the &quot;Irish Summer Time&quot; appears to have been an
 395 # error, as Ireland&#39;s Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 states that
 396 # standard time in Ireland remains at UT +01 and is observed in
 397 # summer, and that Greenwich mean time is observed in winter.  (Thanks
 398 # to Derick Rethans for pointing out the error.)  That is, when
 399 # Ireland amended the 1968 act that established UT +01 as Irish
 400 # Standard Time, it left standard time unchanged and established GMT
 401 # as a negative daylight saving time in winter.  So, in this database
 402 # IST stands for Irish Summer Time for timestamps before 1968, and for
 403 # Irish Standard Time after that.  See:

 534 # From Paul Eggert (2018-02-15):
 535 # In January 2018 we discovered that the negative SAVE values in the
 536 # Eire rules cause problems with tests for ICU:
 537 # https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025825.html
 538 # and with tests for OpenJDK:
 539 # https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025822.html
 540 #
 541 # To work around this problem, the build procedure can translate the
 542 # following data into two forms, one with negative SAVE values and the
 543 # other form with a traditional approximation for Irish timestamps
 544 # after 1971-10-31 02:00 UTC; although this approximation has tm_isdst
 545 # flags that are reversed, its UTC offsets are correct and this often
 546 # suffices.  This source file currently uses only nonnegative SAVE
 547 # values, but this is intended to change and downstream code should
 548 # not rely on it.
 549 #
 550 # The following is like GB-Eire and EU, except with standard time in
 551 # summer and negative daylight saving time in winter.  It is for when
 552 # negative SAVE values are used.

1026 # From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-04-26):
1027 # http://www.hum.aau.dk/~poe/tid/tine/DanskTid.htm says that the law
1028 # [introducing standard time] was in effect from 1894-01-01....
1029 # The page http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A18930008330-REGL
1030 # confirms this, and states that the law was put forth 1893-03-29.
1031 #
1032 # The EU [actually, EEC and Euratom] treaty with effect from 1973:
1033 # http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A19722110030-REGL
1034 #
1035 # This provoked a new law from 1974 to make possible summer time changes
1036 # in subsequent decrees with the law
1037 # http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A19740022330-REGL
1038 #
1039 # It seems however that no decree was set forward until 1980.  I have
1040 # not found any decree, but in another related law, the effecting DST
1041 # changes are stated explicitly to be from 1980-04-06 at 02:00 to
1042 # 1980-09-28 at 02:00.  If this is true, this differs slightly from
1043 # the EU rule in that DST runs to 02:00, not 03:00.  We don&#39;t know
1044 # when Denmark began using the EU rule correctly, but we have only
1045 # confirmation of the 1980-time, so I presume it was correct in 1981:
1046 # The law is about the management of the extra hour, concerning
1047 # working hours reported and effect on obligatory-rest rules (which
1048 # was suspended on that night):

1054 
1055 # From Paul Eggert (2005-06-11):
1056 # Hence the &quot;02:00&quot; of the 1980 law refers to standard time, not

1088 # From Paul Eggert (2017-12-10):
1089 # Greenland joined the European Communities as part of Denmark,
1090 # obtained home rule on 1979-05-01, and left the European Communities
1091 # on 1985-02-01.  It therefore should have been using EU
1092 # rules at least through 1984.  Shanks &amp; Pottenger say Scoresbysund and Godthåb
1093 # used C-Eur rules after 1980, but IATA SSIM (1991/1996) says they use EU

1096 # From Gwillim Law (2001-06-06), citing
1097 # &lt;http://www.statkart.no/efs/efshefter/2001/efs5-2001.pdf&gt; (2001-03-15),
1098 # and with translations corrected by Steffen Thorsen:
1099 #
1100 # Greenland has four local times, and the relation to UTC
1101 # is according to the following time line:
1102 #
1103 # The military zone near Thule	UTC-4
1104 # Standard Greenland time	UTC-3
1105 # Scoresbysund			UTC-1
1106 # Danmarkshavn			UTC
1107 #
1108 # In the military area near Thule and in Danmarkshavn DST will not be
1109 # introduced.
1110 
1111 # From Rives McDow (2001-11-01):
1112 #
1113 # I correspond regularly with the Dansk Polarcenter, and wrote them at
1114 # the time to clarify the situation in Thule.  Unfortunately, I have
1115 # not heard back from them regarding my recent letter.  [But I have
1116 # info from earlier correspondence.]
1117 #
1118 # According to the center, a very small local time zone around Thule
1119 # Air Base keeps the time according to UTC-4, implementing daylight
1120 # savings using North America rules, changing the time at 02:00 local time....
1121 #
1122 # The east coast of Greenland north of the community of Scoresbysund
1123 # uses UTC in the same way as in Iceland, year round, with no dst.
1124 # There are just a few stations on this coast, including the
1125 # Danmarkshavn ICAO weather station mentioned in your September 29th
1126 # email.  The other stations are two sledge patrol stations in
1127 # Mestersvig and Daneborg, the air force base at Station Nord, and the
1128 # DPC research station at Zackenberg.
1129 #
1130 # Scoresbysund and two small villages nearby keep time UTC-1 and use
1131 # the same daylight savings time period as in West Greenland (Godthåb).
1132 #
1133 # The rest of Greenland, including Godthåb (this area, although it
1134 # includes central Greenland, is known as west Greenland), keeps time
1135 # UTC-3, with daylight savings methods according to European rules.
1136 #
1137 # It is common procedure to use UTC 0 in the wilderness of East and
1138 # North Greenland, because it is mainly Icelandic aircraft operators
1139 # maintaining traffic in these areas.  However, the official status of
1140 # this area is that it sticks with Godthåb time.  This area might be
1141 # considered a dual time zone in some respects because of this.
1142 
1143 # From Rives McDow (2001-11-19):
1144 # I heard back from someone stationed at Thule; the time change took place
1145 # there at 2:00 AM.
1146 
1147 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
1148 # From 1997 on the CIA map shows Danmarkshavn on GMT;
1149 # the 1995 map as like Godthåb.
1150 # For lack of better info, assume they were like Godthåb before 1996.
1151 # startkart.no says Thule does not observe DST, but this is clearly an error,
1152 # so go with Shanks &amp; Pottenger for Thule transitions until this year.
1153 # For 2007 on assume Thule will stay in sync with US DST rules.

1542 # From Adam David (1993-11-06):
1543 # The name of the timezone in Iceland for system / mail / news purposes is GMT.
1544 #
1545 # (1993-12-05):
1546 # This material is paraphrased from the 1988 edition of the University of
1547 # Iceland Almanak.
1548 #
1549 # From January 1st, 1908 the whole of Iceland was standardised at 1 hour
1550 # behind GMT. Previously, local mean solar time was used in different parts
1551 # of Iceland, the almanak had been based on Reykjavik mean solar time which
1552 # was 1 hour and 28 minutes behind GMT.
1553 #
1554 # &quot;first day of winter&quot; referred to [below] means the first day of the 26 weeks
1555 # of winter, according to the old icelandic calendar that dates back to the
1556 # time the norsemen first settled Iceland.  The first day of winter is always
1557 # Saturday, but is not dependent on the Julian or Gregorian calendars.
1558 #
1559 # (1993-12-10):
1560 # I have a reference from the Oxford Icelandic-English dictionary for the
1561 # beginning of winter, which ties it to the ecclesiastical calendar (and thus
1562 # to the julian/gregorian calendar) over the period in question.
1563 #	the winter begins on the Saturday next before St. Luke&#39;s day
1564 #	(old style), or on St. Luke&#39;s day, if a Saturday.
1565 # St. Luke&#39;s day ought to be traceable from ecclesiastical sources. &quot;old style&quot;
1566 # might be a reference to the Julian calendar as opposed to Gregorian, or it
1567 # might mean something else (???).

1599 #
1600 # From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
1601 # Sicily and Sardinia each had their own time zones from 1866 to 1893,
1602 # called Palermo Time (+00:53:28) and Cagliari Time (+00:36:32).
1603 # During World War II, German-controlled Italy used German time.
1604 # But these events all occurred before the 1970 cutoff,
1605 # so record only the time in Rome.
1606 #
1607 # From Michael Deckers (2016-10-24):
1608 # http://www.ac-ilsestante.it/MERIDIANE/ora_legale quotes a law of 1893-08-10
1609 # ... [translated as] &quot;The preceding dispositions will enter into
1610 # force at the instant at which, according to the time specified in
1611 # the 1st article, the 1st of November 1893 will begin....&quot;
1612 #
1613 # From Pierpaolo Bernardi (2016-10-20):
1614 # The authoritative source for time in Italy is the national metrological
1615 # institute, which has a summary page of historical DST data at
1616 # http://www.inrim.it/res/tf/ora_legale_i.shtml
1617 # (2016-10-24):
1618 # http://www.renzobaldini.it/le-ore-legali-in-italia/
1619 # has still different data for 1944.  It divides Italy in two, as
1620 # there were effectively two governments at the time, north of Gothic
1621 # Line German controlled territory, official government RSI, and south
1622 # of the Gothic Line, controlled by allied armies.
1623 #
1624 # From Brian Inglis (2016-10-23):
1625 # Viceregal LEGISLATIVE DECREE. 14 September 1944, no. 219.
1626 # Restoration of Standard Time. (044U0219) (OJ 62 of 30.9.1944) ...
1627 # Given the R. law decreed on 1944-03-29, no. 92, by which standard time is
1628 # advanced to sixty minutes later starting at hour two on 1944-04-02; ...
1629 # Starting at hour three on the date 1944-09-17 standard time will be resumed.
1630 #
1631 # From Paul Eggert (2016-10-27):
1632 # Go with INRiM for DST rules, except as corrected by Inglis for 1944
1633 # for the Kingdom of Italy.  This is consistent with Renzo Baldini.
1634 # Model Rome&#39;s occupation by using C-Eur rules from 1943-09-10
1635 # to 1944-06-04; although Rome was an open city during this period, it
1636 # was effectively controlled by Germany.

1904 # the act of the government of the Republic of Moldova Nr. 132 from 1990-05-04
1905 # http://lex.justice.md/viewdoc.php?action=view&amp;view=doc&amp;id=298782&amp;lang=2
1906 # ... says that since 1990-05-06 on the territory of the Moldavian SSR
1907 # time would be calculated as the standard time of the second time belt
1908 # plus one hour of the &quot;summer&quot; time. To implement that clocks would be
1909 # adjusted one hour backwards at 1990-05-06 2:00. After that &quot;summer&quot;
1910 # time would be cancelled last Sunday of September at 3:00 and
1911 # reintroduced last Sunday of March at 2:00.
1912 
1913 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
1914 # A previous version of this database followed Shanks &amp; Pottenger, who write
1915 # that Tiraspol switched to Moscow time on 1992-01-19 at 02:00.
1916 # However, this is most likely an error, as Moldova declared independence
1917 # on 1991-08-27 (the 1992-01-19 date is that of a Russian decree).
1918 # In early 1992 there was large-scale interethnic violence in the area
1919 # and it&#39;s possible that some Russophones continued to observe Moscow time.
1920 # But [two people] separately reported via
1921 # Jesper Nørgaard that as of 2001-01-24 Tiraspol was like Chisinau.
1922 # The Tiraspol entry has therefore been removed for now.
1923 #
1924 # From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-10-17):
1925 # Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR, also known as
1926 # &quot;Pridnestrovie&quot;) has abolished seasonal clock change (no transition
1927 # to the Winter Time).

1995 # However, Robert H. van Gent writes (2001-04-01):
1996 # Howse&#39;s statement is only correct up to 1909. From 1909-05-01 (00:00:00
1997 # Amsterdam mean time) onwards, the whole of the Netherlands (including
1998 # the Dutch railways) was required by law to observe Amsterdam mean time
1999 # (19 minutes 32.13 seconds ahead of GMT). This had already been the
2000 # common practice (except for the railways) for many decades but it was
2001 # not until 1909 when the Dutch government finally defined this by law.
2002 # On 1937-07-01 this was changed to 20 minutes (exactly) ahead of GMT and
2003 # was generally known as Dutch Time (&quot;Nederlandse Tijd&quot;).
2004 #
2005 # (2001-04-08):
2006 # 1892-05-01 was the date when the Dutch railways were by law required to
2007 # observe GMT while the remainder of the Netherlands adhered to the common
2008 # practice of following Amsterdam mean time.
2009 #
2010 # (2001-04-09):
2011 # In 1835 the authorities of the province of North Holland requested the
2012 # municipal authorities of the towns and cities in the province to observe
2013 # Amsterdam mean time but I do not know in how many cases this request was
2014 # actually followed.
2015 #
2016 # From 1852 onwards the Dutch telegraph offices were by law required to
2017 # observe Amsterdam mean time. As the time signals from the observatory of
2018 # Leiden were also distributed by the telegraph system, I assume that most
2019 # places linked up with the telegraph (and railway) system automatically
2020 # adopted Amsterdam mean time.
2021 #
2022 # Although the early Dutch railway companies initially observed a variety
2023 # of times, most of them had adopted Amsterdam mean time by 1858 but it
2024 # was not until 1866 when they were all required by law to observe
2025 # Amsterdam mean time.

2082 # Svalbard &amp; Jan Mayen
2083 
2084 # From Steffen Thorsen (2001-05-01):
2085 # Although I could not find it explicitly, it seems that Jan Mayen and
2086 # Svalbard have been using the same time as Norway at least since the
2087 # time they were declared as parts of Norway.  Svalbard was declared
2088 # as a part of Norway by law of 1925-07-17 no 11, section 4 and Jan
2089 # Mayen by law of 1930-02-27 no 2, section 2. (From
2090 # &lt;http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19250717-011.html&gt; and
2091 # &lt;http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19300227-002.html&gt;).  The law/regulation
2092 # for normal/standard time in Norway is from 1894-06-29 no 1 (came
2093 # into operation on 1895-01-01) and Svalbard/Jan Mayen seem to be a
2094 # part of this law since 1925/1930. (From
2095 # &lt;http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-18940629-001.html&gt;) I have not been
2096 # able to find if Jan Mayen used a different time zone (e.g. -0100)
2097 # before 1930. Jan Mayen has only been &quot;inhabited&quot; since 1921 by
2098 # Norwegian meteorologists and maybe used the same time as Norway ever
2099 # since 1921.  Svalbard (Arctic/Longyearbyen) has been inhabited since
2100 # before 1895, and therefore probably changed the local time somewhere
2101 # between 1895 and 1925 (inclusive).
2102 
2103 # From Paul Eggert (2013-09-04):
2104 #
2105 # Actually, Jan Mayen was never occupied by Germany during World War II,
2106 # so it must have diverged from Oslo time during the war, as Oslo was
2107 # keeping Berlin time.
2108 #
2109 # &lt;https://www.jan-mayen.no/history.htm&gt; says that the meteorologists
2110 # burned down their station in 1940 and left the island, but returned in
2111 # 1941 with a small Norwegian garrison and continued operations despite
2112 # frequent air attacks from Germans.  In 1943 the Americans established a
2113 # radiolocating station on the island, called &quot;Atlantic City&quot;.  Possibly
2114 # the UT offset changed during the war, but I think it unlikely that
2115 # Jan Mayen used German daylight-saving rules.
2116 #
2117 # Svalbard is more complicated, as it was raided in August 1941 by an
2118 # Allied party that evacuated the civilian population to England (says
2119 # &lt;http://www.bartleby.com/65/sv/Svalbard.html&gt;).  The Svalbard FAQ
2120 # &lt;http://www.svalbard.com/SvalbardFAQ.html&gt; says that the Germans were
2121 # expelled on 1942-05-14.  However, small parties of Germans did return,
2122 # and according to Wilhelm Dege&#39;s book &quot;War North of 80&quot; (1954)
2123 # http://www.ucalgary.ca/UofC/departments/UP/1-55238/1-55238-110-2.html
2124 # the German armed forces at the Svalbard weather station code-named
2125 # Haudegen did not surrender to the Allies until September 1945.
2126 #
2127 # All these events predate our cutoff date of 1970, so use Europe/Oslo

2181 # https://dre.pt/application/dir/pdf1sdip/1911/05/12500/23132313.pdf
2182 # Lisbon was at -0:36:44.68, but switched to GMT on 1912-01-01 at 00:00.
2183 # Round the old offset to -0:36:45.  This agrees with Willett....
2184 #
2185 # From Michael Deckers (2018-02-15):
2186 # article 5 [of the 1911 decree; Deckers&#39;s translation] ...:
2187 # These dispositions shall enter into force at the instant at which,
2188 # according to the 2nd article, the civil day January 1, 1912 begins,
2189 # all clocks therefore having to be advanced or set back correspondingly ...
2190 
2191 # From Rui Pedro Salgueiro (1992-11-12):
2192 # Portugal has recently (September, 27) changed timezone
2193 # (from WET to MET or CET) to harmonize with EEC.
2194 #
2195 # Martin Bruckmann (1996-02-29) reports via Peter Ilieve
2196 # that Portugal is reverting to 0:00 by not moving its clocks this spring.
2197 # The new Prime Minister was fed up with getting up in the dark in the winter.
2198 #
2199 # From Paul Eggert (1996-11-12):
2200 # IATA SSIM (1991-09) reports several 1991-09 and 1992-09 transitions
2201 # at 02:00u, not 01:00u.  Assume that these are typos.
2202 # IATA SSIM (1991/1992) reports that the Azores were at -1:00.
2203 # IATA SSIM (1993-02) says +0:00; later issues (through 1996-09) say -1:00.
2204 # Guess that the Azores changed to EU rules in 1992 (since that&#39;s when Portugal
2205 # harmonized with EU rules), and that they stayed +0:00 that winter.

2470 # says that the 1956 decision to change time belts&#39; borders was not
2471 # implemented as planned in 1956 and the change happened in 1957.
2472 # There is also the problem that actual time zones were different from
2473 # the official time belts (and from many time belts&#39; maps) as there were
2474 # numerous exceptions to application of time belt rules.  For example,
2475 # https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Московское_время#Перемещение_границы_применения_московского_времени_на_восток
2476 # says that by 1962 there were many regions in the 3rd time belt that
2477 # were on Moscow time, referring to a 1962 map.  By 1989 number of such
2478 # exceptions grew considerably.

2586 # same Nauka i Zhizn articles converted to the text form (but misses
2587 # time belt changes map).
2588 #
2589 # The second Nauka i Zhizn article says that in addition to
2590 # introduction of summer time on 1981-04-01 there are some time belt
2591 # border changes on 1981-10-01, mostly affecting Nenets Autonomous
2592 # Okrug, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Yakutia, Magadan Oblast and Chukotka
2593 # according to the provided map (colored one).  In addition to that
2594 # &quot;time violators&quot; (regions which were not using rules of the time
2595 # belts in which they were located) would not be moving off the DST on
2596 # 1981-10-01 to restore the decree time usage.  (Komi ASSR was

3499 # From Ivan Nilsson (2001-04-13), superseding Shanks &amp; Pottenger:
3500 #
3501 # The law &quot;Svensk författningssamling 1878, no 14&quot; about standard time in 1879:
3502 # From the beginning of 1879 (that is 01-01 00:00) the time for all
3503 # places in the country is &quot;the mean solar time for the meridian at
3504 # three degrees, or twelve minutes of time, to the west of the
3505 # meridian of the Observatory of Stockholm&quot;.  The law is dated 1878-05-31.
3506 #
3507 # The observatory at that time had the meridian 18° 03&#39; 30&quot;
3508 # eastern longitude = 01:12:14 in time.  Less 12 minutes gives the
3509 # national standard time as 01:00:14 ahead of GMT....
3510 #
3511 # About the beginning of CET in Sweden. The lawtext (&quot;Svensk
3512 # författningssamling 1899, no 44&quot;) states, that &quot;from the beginning
3513 # of 1900... ... the same as the mean solar time for the meridian at
3514 # the distance of one hour of time from the meridian of the English
3515 # observatory at Greenwich, or at 12 minutes 14 seconds to the west
3516 # from the meridian of the Observatory of Stockholm&quot;. The law is dated
3517 # 1899-06-16.  In short: At 1900-01-01 00:00:00 the new standard time
3518 # in Sweden is 01:00:00 ahead of GMT.
3519 #
3520 # 1916: The lawtext (&quot;Svensk författningssamling 1916, no 124&quot;) states
3521 # that &quot;1916-05-15 is considered to begin one hour earlier&quot;. It is
3522 # pretty obvious that at 05-14 23:00 the clocks are set to 05-15 00:00....
3523 # Further the law says, that &quot;1916-09-30 is considered to end one hour later&quot;.
3524 #
3525 # The laws regulating [DST] are available on the site of the Swedish
3526 # Parliament beginning with 1985 - the laws regulating 1980/1984 are

3564 # From Alois Treindl (2008-12-17):
3565 # I have researched the DST usage in Switzerland during the 1940ies.
3566 #
3567 # As I wrote in an earlier message, I suspected the current tzdata values
3568 # to be wrong. This is now verified.
3569 #
3570 # I have found copies of the original ruling by the Swiss Federal
3571 # government, in &#39;Eidgenössische Gesetzessammlung 1941 and 1942&#39; (Swiss
3572 # federal law collection)...
3573 #
3574 # DST began on Monday 5 May 1941, 1:00 am by shifting the clocks to 2:00 am
3575 # DST ended on Monday 6 Oct 1941, 2:00 am by shifting the clocks to 1:00 am.
3576 #
3577 # DST began on Monday, 4 May 1942 at 01:00 am
3578 # DST ended on Monday, 5 Oct 1942 at 02:00 am
3579 #
3580 # There was no DST in 1940, I have checked the law collection carefully.
3581 # It is also indicated by the fact that the 1942 entry in the law
3582 # collection points back to 1941 as a reference, but no reference to any
3583 # other years are made.
3584 #
3585 # Newspaper articles I have read in the archives on 6 May 1941 reported
3586 # about the introduction of DST (Sommerzeit in German) during the previous
3587 # night as an absolute novelty, because this was the first time that such
3588 # a thing had happened in Switzerland.
3589 #
3590 # I have also checked 1916, because one book source (Gabriel, Traité de
3591 # l&#39;heure dans le monde) claims that Switzerland had DST in 1916. This is
3592 # false, no official document could be found. Probably Gabriel got misled
3593 # by references to Germany, which introduced DST in 1916 for the first time.
3594 #
3595 # The tzdata rules for Switzerland must be changed to:
3596 # Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       May     Mon&gt;=1  1:00    1:00    S
3597 # Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       Oct     Mon&gt;=1  2:00    0       -
3598 #
3599 # The 1940 rules must be deleted.
3600 #
3601 # One further detail for Switzerland, which is probably out of scope for
3602 # most users of tzdata: The [Europe/Zurich zone] ...
3603 # describes all of Switzerland correctly, with the exception of
3604 # the Canton de Genève (Geneva, Genf). Between 1848 and 1894 Geneva did not
3605 # follow Bern Mean Time but kept its own local mean time.
3606 # To represent this, an extra zone would be needed.
3607 #
3608 # From Alois Treindl (2013-09-11):
3609 # The Federal regulations say
3610 # https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20071096/index.html
3611 # ... the meridian for Bern mean time ... is 7° 26&#39; 22.50&quot;.
3612 # Expressed in time, it is 0h29m45.5s.
3613 
3614 # From Pierre-Yves Berger (2013-09-11):

3616 # http://www.amtsdruckschriften.bar.admin.ch/viewOrigDoc.do?id=10071353

3631 # suggests that the transition was more gradual, and that the Swiss did not
3632 # agree about civil time during the transition.  The timekeeping it gives the
3633 # most detail for is postal and telegraph time: here, federal legislation (the

3636 # (Bundesblatt 1853, Bd. II, S. 859).  On p 72 Messerli writes that in
3637 # practice since July 1853 Bernese time was used in &quot;all postal and telegraph
3638 # offices in Switzerland from Geneva to St. Gallen and Basel to Chiasso&quot;
3639 # (Google translation).  For now, model this transition as occurring on
3640 # 1853-07-16, though it probably occurred at some other date in Zurich, and

3814 # From Igor Karpov, who works for the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice,
3815 # via Garrett Wollman (2003-01-27):
3816 # BTW, I&#39;ve found the official document on this matter. It&#39;s government
3817 # regulations No. 509, May 13, 1996. In my poor translation it says:
3818 # &quot;Time in Ukraine is set to second timezone (Kiev time). Each last Sunday
3819 # of March at 3am the time is changing to 4am and each last Sunday of
3820 # October the time at 4am is changing to 3am&quot;
3821 
3822 # From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-09-20):
3823 # On September 20, 2011 the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada agreed to
3824 # abolish the transfer clock to winter time.
3825 #
3826 # Bill No. 8330 of MP from the Party of Regions Oleg Nadoshi got
3827 # approval from 266 deputies.
3828 #
3829 # Ukraine abolishes transfer back to the winter time (in Russian)

3837 #
3838 # From Philip Pizzey (2011-10-18):
3839 # Today my Ukrainian colleagues have informed me that the
3840 # Ukrainian parliament have decided that they will go to winter
3841 # time this year after all.
3842 #
3843 # From Udo Schwedt (2011-10-18):
3844 # As far as I understand, the recent change to the Ukrainian time zone
3845 # (Europe/Kiev) to introduce permanent daylight saving time (similar
3846 # to Russia) was reverted today:

3853 # From Vladimir in Moscow via Alois Treindl re Kiev time 1991/2 (2014-02-28):
3854 # First in Ukraine they changed Time zone from UTC+3 to UTC+2 with DST:
3855 #       03 25 1990 02:00 -03.00 1       Time Zone 3 with DST

3858 # http://search.ligazakon.ua/l_doc2.nsf/link1/T001500.html
3859 #
3860 # They did not end DST in September, 1990 (according to the law,
3861 # &quot;summer time&quot; was still in action):
3862 #       09 30 1990 03:00 -02.00 1       Time Zone 2 with DST

3868 #
3869 # DST ended in September 1991 (&quot;summer time&quot; ended):

3873 # This is an answer.
3874 #
3875 # Since 1992 they had normal DST procedure:
3876 #       03 29 1992 02:00 -02.00 1       DST started

3880 
3881 # From Paul Eggert (2018-10-03):
3882 # As is usual in tzdb, Ukrainian zones use the most common English spellings.
3883 # For example, tzdb uses Europe/Kiev, as &quot;Kiev&quot; is the most common spelling in
3884 # English for Ukraine&#39;s capital, even though it is certainly wrong as a
3885 # transliteration of the Ukrainian &quot;Київ&quot;.  This is similar to tzdb&#39;s use of
3886 # Europe/Prague, which is certainly wrong as a transliteration of the Czech
3887 # &quot;Praha&quot;.  (&quot;Kiev&quot; came from old Slavic via Russian to English, and &quot;Prague&quot;
3888 # came from old Slavic via French to English, so the two cases have something
3889 # in common.)  Admittedly English-language spelling of Ukrainian names is
3890 # controversial, and some day &quot;Kyiv&quot; may become substantially more popular in
3891 # English; in the meantime, stick with the traditional English &quot;Kiev&quot; as that
3892 # means less disruption for our users.
3893 #
3894 # Anyway, none of the common English-language spellings (Kiev, Kyiv, Kieff,
3895 # Kijeff, Kijev, Kiyef, Kiyeff) do justice to the common pronunciation in
3896 # Ukrainian, namely [ˈkɪjiu̯] (IPA).  This pronunciation has nothing like an
3897 # English &quot;v&quot; or &quot;f&quot;, and instead trails off with what an English-speaker
3898 # would call a demure &quot;oo&quot; sound, and it would would be better anglicized as
3899 # &quot;Kuiyu&quot;.  Here&#39;s a sound file, if you would like to do as the Kuiyuvians do:

3962 # ...the European time rules are...standardized since 1981, when
3963 # most European countries started DST.  Before that year, only
3964 # a few countries (UK, France, Italy) had DST, each according
3965 # to own national rules.  In 1981, however, DST started on
3966 # &#39;Apr firstSun&#39;, and not on &#39;Mar lastSun&#39; as in the following
3967 # years...
3968 # But also since 1981 there are some more national exceptions
3969 # than listed in &#39;europe&#39;: Switzerland, for example, joined DST
3970 # one year later, Denmark ended DST on &#39;Oct 1&#39; instead of &#39;Sep
3971 # lastSun&#39; in 1981 - I don&#39;t know how they handle now.
3972 #
3973 # Finally, DST ist always from &#39;Apr 1&#39; to &#39;Oct 1&#39; in the
3974 # Soviet Union (as far as I know).

3984 #
3985 # The information from Tom Hofmann is (as far as I know) not entirely correct.
3986 # After a request from chongo at amdahl I tried to retrieve all information
3987 # about DST in Europe.  I was able to find all from about 1969.
3988 #
3989 # ...standardization on DST in Europe started in about 1977 with switches on
3990 # first Sunday in April and last Sunday in September...
3991 # In 1981 UK joined Europe insofar that
3992 # the starting day for both shifted to last Sunday in March.  And from 1982
3993 # the whole of Europe used DST, with switch dates April 1 and October 1 in
3994 # the Sov[i]et Union.  In 1985 the SU reverted to standard Europe[a]n switch
3995 # dates...
3996 #
3997 # It should also be remembered that time-zones are not constants; e.g.
3998 # Portugal switched in 1976 from MET (or CET) to WET with DST...
3999 # Note also that though there were rules for switch dates not
4000 # all countries abided to these dates, and many individual deviations
4001 # occurred, though not since 1982 I believe.  Another note: it is always
4002 # assumed that DST is 1 hour ahead of normal time, this need not be the
4003 # case; at least in the Netherlands there have been times when DST was 2 hours
4004 # in advance of normal time.
