  75 # From Alex Livingston (1996-11-01):
  76 # I have heard or read more than once that some resort islands off the coast
  77 # of Queensland chose to keep observing daylight-saving time even after
  78 # Queensland ceased to.
  79 #
  80 # From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
  81 # IATA SSIM (1993-02/1994-09) say that the Holiday Islands (Hayman, Lindeman,
  82 # Hamilton) observed DST for two years after the rest of Queensland stopped.
  83 # Hamilton is the largest, but there is also a Hamilton in Victoria,
  84 # so use Lindeman.
  85 #
  86 # From J William Piggott (2016-02-20):
  87 # There is no location named Holiday Islands in Queensland Australia; holiday
  88 # islands is a colloquial term used globally.  Hayman and Lindeman are at the
  89 # north and south extremes of the Whitsunday Islands archipelago, and
  90 # Hamilton is in between; it is reasonable to believe that this time zone
  91 # applies to all of the Whitsundays.

 392 # From Paul Eggert (2018-07-15):
 393 # For now, guess DST from 02:00 the first Sunday in November to 03:00
 394 # the first Sunday on or after January 13.  January transitions reportedly
 395 # depend on when school terms start.  Although the guess is ad hoc, it matches
 396 # transitions since late 2014 and seems more likely to match future
 397 # practice than guessing no DST.

 773 # From Paul Eggert (2017-02-10):
 774 # Sometimes Johnston kept Hawaii time, and sometimes it was an hour behind.
 775 # Details are uncertain.  We have no data for Johnston after 1970, so
 776 # treat it like Hawaii for now.  Since Johnston is now uninhabited,
 777 # its link to Pacific/Honolulu is in the &#39;backward&#39; file.

 779 # In his memoirs of June 6th to October 4, 1945

 782 # Johnston time, 1:30 AM Kwajalein time.&quot;  This was in June 1945, and

 785 # From Lyle McElhaney (2014-03-11):
 786 # [W]hen JI was being used for that [atomic bomb] testing, the time being used
 787 # was not Hawaiian time but rather the same time being used on the ships,
 788 # which had a GMT offset of -11 hours.  This apparently applied to at least the
 789 # time from Operation Newsreel (Hardtack I/Teak shot, 1958-08-01) to the last

 885 # From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 886 # Daylight saving time has long been controversial in Australia, pitting
 887 # region against region, rural against urban, and local against global.
 888 # For example, in her review of Graeme Davison&#39;s _The Unforgiving
 889 # Minute: how Australians learned to tell the time_ (1993), Perth native
 890 # Phillipa J Martyr wrote, &quot;The section entitled &#39;Saving Daylight&#39; was
 891 # very informative, but was (as can, sadly, only be expected from a
 892 # Melbourne-based study) replete with the usual chuckleheaded
 893 # Queenslanders and straw-chewing yokels from the West prattling fables
 894 # about fading curtains and crazed farm animals.&quot;

 901 # summarizes daylight saving issues in Australia.

 903 # From Arthur David Olson (2005-12-12):
 904 # Lawlink NSW:Daylight Saving in New South Wales
 905 # http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Corporate/ll_agdinfo.nsf/pages/community_relations_daylight_saving
 906 # covers New South Wales in particular.
 907 
 908 # From John Mackin (1991-03-06):
 909 # We in Australia have _never_ referred to DST as &#39;daylight&#39; time.
 910 # It is called &#39;summer&#39; time.  Now by a happy coincidence, &#39;summer&#39;
 911 # and &#39;standard&#39; happen to start with the same letter; hence, the
 912 # abbreviation does _not_ change...
 913 # The legislation does not actually define abbreviations, at least
 914 # in this State, but the abbreviation is just commonly taken to be the
 915 # initials of the phrase, and the legislation here uniformly uses
 916 # the phrase &#39;summer time&#39; and does not use the phrase &#39;daylight
 917 # time&#39;.
 918 # Announcers on the Commonwealth radio network, the ABC (for Australian
 919 # Broadcasting Commission), use the phrases &#39;Eastern Standard Time&#39;
 920 # or &#39;Eastern Summer Time&#39;.  (Note, though, that as I say in the
 921 # current australasia file, there is really no such thing.)  Announcers
 922 # on its overseas service, Radio Australia, use the same phrases
 923 # prefixed by the word &#39;Australian&#39; when referring to local times;
 924 # time announcements on that service, naturally enough, are made in UTC.
 925 
 926 # From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 927 #
 928 # Inspired by Mackin&#39;s remarks quoted above, earlier versions of this
 929 # file used &quot;EST&quot; for both Eastern Standard Time and Eastern Summer
 930 # Time in Australia, and similarly for &quot;CST&quot;, &quot;CWST&quot;, and &quot;WST&quot;.
 931 # However, these abbreviations were confusing and were not common
 932 # practice among Australians, and there were justifiable complaints
 933 # about them, so I attempted to survey current Australian usage.
 934 # For the tz database, the full English phrase is not that important;
 935 # what matters is the abbreviation.  It&#39;s difficult to survey the web
 936 # directly for abbreviation usage, as there are so many false hits for
 937 # strings like &quot;EST&quot; and &quot;EDT&quot;, so I looked for pages that defined an
 938 # abbreviation for eastern or central DST in Australia, and got the
 939 # following numbers of unique hits for the listed Google queries:
 940 #
 941 #   10 &quot;Eastern Daylight Time AEST&quot; site:au [some are false hits]
 942 #   10 &quot;Eastern Summer Time AEST&quot; site:au
 943 #   10 &quot;Summer Time AEDT&quot; site:au
 944 #   13 &quot;EDST Eastern Daylight Saving Time&quot; site:au
 945 #   18 &quot;Summer Time ESST&quot; site:au
 946 #   28 &quot;Eastern Daylight Saving Time EDST&quot; site:au
 947 #   39 &quot;EDT Eastern Daylight Time&quot; site:au [some are false hits]
 948 #   53 &quot;Eastern Daylight Time EDT&quot; site:au [some are false hits]
 949 #   54 &quot;AEDT Australian Eastern Daylight Time&quot; site:au
 950 #  182 &quot;Eastern Daylight Time AEDT&quot; site:au
 951 #
 952 #   17 &quot;Central Daylight Time CDT&quot; site:au [some are false hits]
 953 #   46 &quot;Central Daylight Time ACDT&quot; site:au
 954 #
 955 # I tried several other variants (e.g., &quot;Eastern Summer Time EST&quot;) but
 956 # they all returned fewer than 10 unique hits.  I also looked for pages
 957 # mentioning both &quot;western standard time&quot; and an abbreviation, since
 958 # there is no WST in the US to generate false hits, and found:
 959 #
 960 #  156 &quot;western standard time&quot; AWST site:au
 961 #  226 &quot;western standard time&quot; WST site:au
 962 #
 963 # I then surveyed the top ten newspapers in Australia by circulation as
 964 # listed in Wikipedia, using Google queries like &quot;AEDT site:heraldsun.com.au&quot;
 965 # and obtaining estimated counts from the initial page of search results.
 966 # All ten papers greatly preferred &quot;AEDT&quot; to &quot;EDT&quot;.  The papers
 967 # surveyed were the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Courier-Mail,
 968 # The Sydney Morning Herald, The West Australian, The Age, The Advertiser,
 969 # The Australian, The Financial Review, and The Herald (Newcastle).
 970 #
 971 # I also searched for historical usage, to see whether abbreviations
 972 # like &quot;AEDT&quot; are new.  A Trove search &lt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/&gt;
 973 # found only one newspaper (The Canberra Times) with a house style
 974 # dating back to the 1970s, I expect because other newspapers weren&#39;t
 975 # fully indexed.  The Canberra Times strongly preferred abbreviations
 976 # like &quot;AEDT&quot;.  The first occurrence of &quot;AEDT&quot; was a World Weather
 977 # column (1971-11-17, page 24), and of &quot;ACDT&quot; was a Scoreboard column
 978 # (1993-01-24, p 16).  The style was the typical usage but was not
 979 # strictly enforced; for example, &quot;Welcome to the twilight zones ...&quot;
 980 # (1994-10-29, p 1) uses the abbreviations AEST/AEDT, CST/CDT, and
 981 # WST, and goes on to say, &quot;The confusion and frustration some feel
 982 # about the lack of uniformity among Australia&#39;s six states and two
 983 # territories has prompted one group to form its very own political
 984 # party -- the Sydney-based Daylight Saving Extension Party.&quot;
 985 #
 986 # I also surveyed federal government sources.  They did not agree:

1007 #   EST CST WST preferred for standard time; AEST AEDT ACST ACDT also used
1008 #
1009 #   The Transport Safety Bureau has an extensive series of accident reports,
1010 #   and investigators seem to use whatever abbreviation they like.
1011 #   Googling site:atsb.gov.au found the following number of unique hits:
1012 #   311 &quot;ESuT&quot;, 195 &quot;EDT&quot;, 26 &quot;AEDT&quot;, 83 &quot;CSuT&quot;, 46 &quot;CDT&quot;.
1013 #   &quot;_SuT&quot; tended to appear in older reports, and &quot;A_DT&quot; tended to
1014 #   appear in reports of events with international implications.
1015 #
1016 # From the above it appears that there is a working consensus in
1017 # Australia to use trailing &quot;DT&quot; for daylight saving time; although
1018 # some sources use trailing &quot;SST&quot; or &quot;ST&quot; or &quot;SuT&quot; they are by far in
1019 # the minority.  The case for leading &quot;A&quot; is weaker, but since it
1020 # seems to be preferred in the overall web and is preferred in all
1021 # the leading newspaper websites and in many government departments,
1022 # it has a stronger case than omitting the leading &quot;A&quot;.  The current
1023 # version of the database therefore uses abbreviations like &quot;AEST&quot; and
1024 # &quot;AEDT&quot; for Australian time zones.

1181 # much and set the local time 20 hours and 45 minutes from the

1197 # village just inside the border with South Australia to as far west
1198 # as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is

1307 # discussing his book &quot;The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar
1308 # Observatories&quot;[1], and in particular the Shrine of Remembrance[2] located
1309 # in Melbourne, Australia.
1310 #
1311 # Apparently the shrine&#39;s main purpose is a beam of sunlight which
1312 # illuminates a special spot on the floor at the 11th hour of the 11th day
1313 # of the 11th month (Remembrance Day) every year in memory of Australia&#39;s
1314 # fallen WWI soldiers.  And if you go there on Nov. 11, at 11am local time,
1315 # you will indeed see the sunbeam illuminate the special spot at the
1316 # expected time.
1317 #
1318 # However, that is only because of some special mirror contraption that had
1319 # to be employed, since due to daylight savings time, the true solar time of
1320 # the remembrance moment occurs one hour later (or earlier?).  Perhaps

1422 # Lord Howe Island summer time in 2000/2001 will commence on the same
1423 # date as the rest of NSW (i.e. 2000-08-27).  For your information the
1424 # Lord Howe Island Board (controlling authority for the Island) is
1425 # seeking the community&#39;s views on various options for summer time
1426 # arrangements on the Island, e.g. advance clocks by 1 full hour
1427 # instead of only 30 minutes.  [Dependent] on the wishes of residents
1428 # the Board may approach the NSW government to change the existing
1429 # arrangements.  The starting date for summer time on the Island will
1430 # however always coincide with the rest of NSW.
1431 
1432 # From James Lonergan, Secretary, Lord Howe Island Board (2000-10-25):
1433 # Lord Howe Island advances clocks by 30 minutes during DST in NSW and retards
1434 # clocks by 30 minutes when DST finishes. Since DST was most recently
1435 # introduced in NSW, the &quot;changeover&quot; time on the Island has been 02:00 as
1436 # shown on clocks on LHI. I guess this means that for 30 minutes at the start
1437 # of DST, LHI is actually 1 hour ahead of the rest of NSW.
1438 
1439 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):

1693 #
1694 # Until 1941 Tonga maintained a standard time 50 minutes ahead of NZST
1695 # 12 hours and 20 minutes ahead of GMT.  When New Zealand adjusted its
1696 # standard time in 1940s, Tonga had the choice of subtracting from its
1697 # local time to come on the same standard time as New Zealand or of
1698 # advancing its time to maintain the differential of 13°
1699 # (approximately 50 minutes ahead of New Zealand time).
1700 #
1701 # Because His Majesty King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV, then Crown Prince
1702 # Tungī, preferred to ensure Tonga&#39;s title as the land where time
1703 # begins, the Legislative Assembly approved the latter change.
1704 #
1705 # But some of the older, more conservative members from the outer
1706 # islands objected. &quot;If at midnight on Dec. 31, we move ahead 40
1707 # minutes, as your Royal Highness wishes, what becomes of the 40
1708 # minutes we have lost?&quot;

1805 # The International Date Line
1806 
1807 # From Gwillim Law (2000-01-03):
1808 #
1809 # The International Date Line is not defined by any international standard,
1810 # convention, or treaty.  Mapmakers are free to draw it as they please.
1811 # Reputable mapmakers will simply ensure that every point of land appears on
1812 # the correct side of the IDL, according to the date legally observed there.
1813 #
1814 # When Kiribati adopted a uniform date in 1995, thereby moving the Phoenix and
1815 # Line Islands to the west side of the IDL (or, if you prefer, moving the IDL
1816 # to the east side of the Phoenix and Line Islands), I suppose that most
1817 # mapmakers redrew the IDL following the boundary of Kiribati.  Even that line
1818 # has a rather arbitrary nature.  The straight-line boundaries between Pacific
1819 # island nations that are shown on many maps are based on an international
1820 # convention, but are not legally binding national borders.... The date is
1821 # governed by the IDL; therefore, even on the high seas, there may be some
1822 # places as late as fourteen hours later than UTC.  And, since the IDL is not
1823 # an international standard, there are some places on the high seas where the
1824 # correct date is ambiguous.
1825 
1826 # From Wikipedia &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone&gt; (2005-08-31):
1827 # Before 1920, all ships kept local apparent time on the high seas by setting
1828 # their clocks at night or at the morning sight so that, given the ship&#39;s
1829 # speed and direction, it would be 12 o&#39;clock when the Sun crossed the ship&#39;s
1830 # meridian (12 o&#39;clock = local apparent noon).  During 1917, at the
1831 # Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea, it was recommended that all
1832 # ships, both military and civilian, should adopt hourly standard time zones
1833 # on the high seas.  Whenever a ship was within the territorial waters of any
1834 # nation it would use that nation&#39;s standard time.  The captain was permitted
1835 # to change his ship&#39;s clocks at a time of his choice following his ship&#39;s
1836 # entry into another zone time - he often chose midnight.  These zones were
1837 # adopted by all major fleets between 1920 and 1925 but not by many
1838 # independent merchant ships until World War II.

1843 # The American Practical Navigator (2002)
1844 # http://pollux.nss.nima.mil/pubs/pubs_j_apn_sections.html?rid=187
1845 # talks only about the 180-degree meridian with respect to ships in
1846 # international waters; it ignores the international date line.
