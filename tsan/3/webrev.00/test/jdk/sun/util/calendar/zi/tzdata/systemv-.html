22 # tzdb data for System V rules (this file is obsolete)
23 
24 # This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
25 # 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.
26 
27 # Old rules, should the need arise.
28 # No attempt is made to handle Newfoundland, since it cannot be expressed
29 # using the System V &quot;TZ&quot; scheme (half-hour offset), or anything outside
30 # North America (no support for non-standard DST start/end dates), nor
31 # the changes in the DST rules in the US after 1976 (which occurred after
32 # the old rules were written).
33 #
34 # If you need the old rules, uncomment ## lines.
35 # Compile this *without* leap second correction for true conformance.
