  34 # Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
  35 # Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
  36 # San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
  37 # Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
  38 #
  39 # Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
  40 # for time zone data was the International Air Transport
  41 # Association&#39;s Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
  42 # published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
  43 # of the IATA&#39;s data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
  44 # IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
  45 #
  46 # Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
  47 # Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
  48 # I found in the UCLA library.
  49 #
  50 # For data circa 1899, a common source is:
  51 # Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899 Feb;13(2):173-94.
  52 # https://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359
  53 #
  54 # For Russian data circa 1919, a source is:
  55 # Byalokoz EL. New Counting of Time in Russia since July 1, 1919.
  56 # (See the &#39;europe&#39; file for a fuller citation.)

 117 # readopting Russian DST in 1997.  Go with Shanks &amp; Pottenger, even
 118 # when they disagree with others.  Edgar Der-Danieliantz
 119 # reported (1996-05-04) that Yerevan probably wouldn&#39;t use DST
 120 # in 1996, though it did use DST in 1995.  IATA SSIM (1991/1998) reports that

 387 # From Anthony Fok (2001-12-20):
 388 # BTW, I did some research on-line and found some info regarding these five
 389 # historic timezones from some Taiwan websites.  And yes, there are official
 390 # Chinese names for these locales (before 1949).
 391 #
 392 # From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2006-07-14):
 393 # I have investigated the timezones around 1970 on the
 394 # https://www.astro.com/atlas site [with provinces and county
 395 # boundaries summarized below]....  A few other exceptions were two
 396 # counties on the Sichuan side of the Xizang-Sichuan border,
 397 # counties Dege and Baiyu which lies on the Sichuan side and are
 398 # therefore supposed to be GMT+7, Xizang region being GMT+6, but Dege
 399 # county is GMT+8 according to astro.com while Baiyu county is GMT+6
 400 # (could be true), for the moment I am assuming that those two
 401 # counties are mistakes in the astro.com data.

 412 # It gives evidence that at the beginning of the PRC, Beijing time was
 413 # officially apparent solar time!  However, Guo also says that the
 414 # evidence is dubious, as the relevant institute of astronomy had not
 415 # been taken over by the PRC yet.  It&#39;s plausible that apparent solar
 416 # time was announced but never implemented, and that people continued
 417 # to use UT+8.  As the Shanghai radio station (and I presume the
 418 # observatory) was still under control of French missionaries, it
 419 # could well have ignored any such mandate.
 420 #

 422 # Guo Qing-sheng (Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory, CAS, Xi&#39;an 710600, China)
 423 # A Study on the Standard Time Changes for the Past 100 Years in China
 424 # [undated and unknown publication location]
 425 # It says several things:
 426 #   * The Qing dynasty used local apparent solar time throughout China.
 427 #   * The Republic of China instituted Beijing mean solar time effective
 428 #     the official calendar book of 1914.
 429 #   * The French Concession in Shanghai set up signal stations in
 430 #     French docks in the 1890s, controlled by Xujiahui (Zikawei)
 431 #     Observatory and set to local mean time.
 432 #   * &quot;From the end of the 19th century&quot; it changed to UT+8.
 433 #   * Chinese Customs (by then reduced to a tool of foreign powers)
 434 #     eventually standardized on this time for all ports, and it
 435 #     became used by railways as well.
 436 #   * In 1918 the Central Observatory proposed dividing China into
 437 #     five time zones (see below for details).  This caught on
 438 #     at first only in coastal areas observing UT+8.
 439 #   * During WWII all of China was in theory was at UT+7.  In practice
 440 #     this was ignored in the west, and I presume was ignored in
 441 #     Japanese-occupied territory.
 442 #   * Japanese-occupied Manchuria was at UT+9, i.e., Japan time.
 443 #   * The five-zone plan was resurrected after WWII and officially put into
 444 #     place (with some modifications) in March 1948.  It&#39;s not clear
 445 #     how well it was observed in areas under Nationalist control.
 446 #   * The People&#39;s Liberation Army used UT+8 during the civil war.
 447 #
 448 # An AP article &quot;Shanghai Internat&#39;l Area Little Changed&quot; in the
 449 # Lewiston (ME) Daily Sun (1939-05-29), p 17, said &quot;Even the time is
 450 # different - the occupied districts going by Tokyo time, an hour
 451 # ahead of that prevailing in the rest of Shanghai.&quot;  Guess that the
 452 # Xujiahui Observatory was under French control and stuck with UT +08.
 453 #
 454 # In earlier versions of this file, China had many separate Zone entries, but
 455 # this was based on what were apparently incorrect data in Shanks &amp; Pottenger.
 456 # This has now been simplified to the two entries Asia/Shanghai and
 457 # Asia/Urumqi, with the others being links for backward compatibility.
 458 # Proposed in 1918 and theoretically in effect until 1949 (although in practice
 459 # mainly observed in coastal areas), the five zones were:
 460 #
 461 # Changbai Time (&quot;Long-white Time&quot;, Long-white = Heilongjiang area) UT +08:30
 462 # Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here.
 463 # Heilongjiang (except Mohe county), Jilin
 464 #
 465 # Zhongyuan Time (&quot;Central plain Time&quot;) UT +08
 466 # Now part of Asia/Shanghai.
 467 # most of China
 468 # Milne gives 8:05:43.2 for Xujiahui Observatory time; round to nearest.
 469 # Guo says Shanghai switched to UT +08 &quot;from the end of the 19th century&quot;.
 470 #
 471 # Long-shu Time (probably as Long and Shu were two names of the area) UT +07
 472 # Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here.
 473 # Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Ningxia, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Yunnan;
 474 # most of Gansu; west Inner Mongolia; east Qinghai; and the Guangdong
 475 # counties Deqing, Enping, Kaiping, Luoding, Taishan, Xinxing,
 476 # Yangchun, Yangjiang, Yu&#39;nan, and Yunfu.
 477 #
 478 # Xin-zang Time (&quot;Xinjiang-Tibet Time&quot;) UT +06
 479 # This region is now part of either Asia/Urumqi or Asia/Shanghai with
 480 # current boundaries uncertain; times before 1970 for areas that

 497 
 498 # From Luther Ma (2009-10-17):
 499 # Almost all (&gt;99.9%) ethnic Chinese (properly ethnic Han) living in
 500 # Xinjiang use Chinese Standard Time. Some are aware of Xinjiang time,
 501 # but have no need of it. All planes, trains, and schools function on
 502 # what is called &quot;Beijing time.&quot; When Han make an appointment in Chinese
 503 # they implicitly use Beijing time.
 504 #
 505 # On the other hand, ethnic Uyghurs, who make up about half the
 506 # population of Xinjiang, typically use &quot;Xinjiang time&quot; which is two
 507 # hours behind Beijing time, or UT +06. The government of the Xinjiang
 508 # Uyghur Autonomous Region, (XAUR, or just Xinjiang for short) as well as
 509 # local governments such as the Ürümqi city government use both times in
 510 # publications, referring to what is popularly called Xinjiang time as
 511 # &quot;Ürümqi time.&quot; When Uyghurs make an appointment in the Uyghur language
 512 # they almost invariably use Xinjiang time.
 513 #
 514 # (Their ethnic Han compatriots would typically have no clue of its
 515 # widespread use, however, because so extremely few of them are fluent in
 516 # Uyghur, comparable to the number of Anglo-Americans fluent in Navajo.)
 517 #
 518 # (...As with the rest of China there was a brief interval ending in 1990
 519 # or 1991 when summer time was in use.  The confusion was severe, with
 520 # the province not having dual times but four times in use at the same
 521 # time. Some areas remained on standard Xinjiang time or Beijing time and
 522 # others moving their clocks ahead.)
 523 
 524 # From Luther Ma (2009-11-19):
 525 # With the risk of being redundant to previous answers these are the most common
 526 # English &quot;transliterations&quot; (w/o using non-English symbols):
 527 #
 528 # 1. Wulumuqi...
 529 # 2. Kashi...
 530 # 3. Urumqi...
 531 # 4. Kashgar...
 532 # ...
 533 # 5. It seems that Uyghurs in Ürümqi has been using Xinjiang since at least the
 534 # 1960&#39;s. I know of one Han, now over 50, who grew up in the surrounding
 535 # countryside and used Xinjiang time as a child.
 536 #
 537 # 6. Likewise for Kashgar and the rest of south Xinjiang I don&#39;t know of any
 538 # start date for Xinjiang time.
 539 #
 540 # Without having access to local historical records, nor the ability to legally
 541 # publish them, I would go with October 1, 1949, when Xinjiang became the Uyghur
 542 # Autonomous Region under the PRC. (Before that Uyghurs, of course, would also
 543 # not be using Beijing time, but some local time.)
 544 
 545 # From David Cochrane (2014-03-26):
 546 # Just a confirmation that Ürümqi time was implemented in Ürümqi on 1 Feb 1986:
 547 # https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960684,00.html
 548 
 549 # From Luther Ma (2014-04-22):
 550 # I have interviewed numerous people of various nationalities and from
 551 # different localities in Xinjiang and can confirm the information in Guo&#39;s
 552 # report regarding Xinjiang, as well as the Time article reference by David
 553 # Cochrane.  Whether officially recognized or not (and both are officially
 554 # recognized), two separate times have been in use in Xinjiang since at least
 555 # the Cultural Revolution: Xinjiang Time (XJT), aka Ürümqi Time or local time;
 556 # and Beijing Time.  There is no confusion in Xinjiang as to which name refers
 557 # to which time. Both are widely used in the province, although in some
 558 # population groups might be use one to the exclusion of the other.  The only
 559 # problem is that computers and smart phones list Ürümqi (or Kashgar) as
 560 # having the same time as Beijing.
 561 
 562 # From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 563 # In the early days of the PRC, Tibet was given its own time zone (UT +06)
 564 # but this was withdrawn in 1959 and never reinstated; see Tubten Khétsun,
 565 # Memories of life in Lhasa under Chinese Rule, Columbia U Press, ISBN
 566 # 978-0231142861 (2008), translator&#39;s introduction by Matthew Akester, p x.
 567 # As this is before our 1970 cutoff, Tibet doesn&#39;t need a separate zone.
 568 #
 569 # Xinjiang Time is well-documented as being officially recognized.  E.g., see
 570 # &quot;The Working-Calendar for The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government&quot;
 571 # &lt;http://www.sinkiang.gov.cn/service/ourworking/&gt; (2014-04-22).
 572 # Unfortunately, we have no good records of time in Xinjiang before 1986.
 573 # During the 20th century parts of Xinjiang were ruled by the Qing dynasty,
 574 # the Republic of China, various warlords, the First and Second East Turkestan
 575 # Republics, the Soviet Union, the Kuomintang, and the People&#39;s Republic of
 576 # China, and tracking down all these organizations&#39; timekeeping rules would be
 577 # quite a trick.  Approximate this lost history by a transition from LMT to
 578 # UT +06 at the start of 1928, the year of accession of the warlord Jin Shuren,
 579 # which happens to be the date given by Shanks &amp; Pottenger (no doubt as a
 580 # guess) as the transition from LMT.  Ignore the usage of +08 before
 581 # 1986-02-01 under the theory that the transition date to +08 is unknown and
 582 # that the sort of users who prefer Asia/Urumqi now typically ignored the
 583 # +08 mandate back then.

 690 # Taiwan
 691 
 692 # From smallufo (2010-04-03):
 693 # According to Taiwan&#39;s CWB [Central Weather Bureau],
 694 # http://www.cwb.gov.tw/V6/astronomy/cdata/summert.htm
 695 # Taipei has DST in 1979 between July 1st and Sep 30.
 696 
 697 # From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2013-07-12):
 698 # On Dec 28, 1895, the Meiji Emperor announced Ordinance No. 167 of
 699 # Meiji Year 28 &quot;The clause about standard time&quot;, mentioned that
 700 # Taiwan and Penghu Islands, as well as Yaeyama and Miyako Islands
 701 # (both in Okinawa) adopt the Western Standard Time which is based on
 702 # 120E. The adoption began from Jan 1, 1896. The original text can be
 703 # found on Wikisource:
 704 # https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/標準時ニ關スル件_(公布時)
 705 # ... This could be the first adoption of time zone in Taiwan, because
 706 # during the Qing Dynasty, it seems that there was no time zone
 707 # declared officially.
 708 #
 709 # Later, in the beginning of World War II, on Sep 25, 1937, the Showa
 710 # Emperor announced Ordinance No. 529 of Showa Year 12 &quot;The clause of
 711 # revision in the ordinance No. 167 of Meiji year 28 about standard
 712 # time&quot;, in which abolished the adoption of Western Standard Time in
 713 # western islands (listed above), which means the whole Japan
 714 # territory, including later occupations, adopt Japan Central Time
 715 # (UT+9). The adoption began on Oct 1, 1937. The original text can
 716 # be found on Wikisource:
 717 # https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/明治二十八年勅令第百六十七號標準時ニ關スル件中改正ノ件
 718 #
 719 # That is, the time zone of Taipei switched to UT+9 on Oct 1, 1937.
 720 
 721 # From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
 722 # I&#39;ve found more evidence about when the time zone was switched from UT+9
 723 # back to UT+8 after WW2.  I believe it was on Sep 21, 1945.  In a document
 724 # during Japanese era [1] in which the officer told the staff to change time
 725 # zone back to Western Standard Time (UT+8) on Sep 21.  And in another
 726 # history page of National Cheng Kung University [2], on Sep 21 there is a
 727 # note &quot;from today, switch back to Western Standard Time&quot;.  From these two
 728 # materials, I believe that the time zone change happened on Sep 21.  And
 729 # today I have found another monthly journal called &quot;The Astronomical Herald&quot;
 730 # from The Astronomical Society of Japan [3] in which it mentioned the fact
 731 # that:
 732 #
 733 # 1. Standard Time of the Country (Japan) was adopted on Jan 1, 1888, using
 734 # the time at 135E (GMT+9)
 735 #
 736 # 2. Standard Time of the Country was renamed to Central Standard Time, on Jan
 737 # 1, 1898, and on the same day, the new territories Taiwan and Penghu islands,
 738 # as well as Yaeyama and Miyako islands, adopted a new time zone called
 739 # Western Standard Time, which is in GMT+8.
 740 #
 741 # 3. Western Standard Time was deprecated on Sep 30, 1937. From then all the
 742 # territories of Japan adopted the same time zone, which is Central Standard
 743 # Time.

 752 # Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-03):
 753 # I finally have found the real official gazette about changing back to
 754 # Western Standard Time on Sep 21 in Taiwan.  It&#39;s Taiwan Governor-General
 755 # Bulletin No. 386 in Showa 20 years (1945), published on Sep 19, 1945. [1] ...
 756 # [It] abolishes Bulletin No. 207 in Showa 12 years (1937), which is a local
 757 # bulletin in Taiwan for that Ordinance No. 529. It also mentioned that 1am on
 758 # Sep 21, 1945 will be 12am on Sep 21.  I think this bulletin is much more
 759 # official than the one I mentioned in my first mail, because it&#39;s from the
 760 # top-level government in Taiwan. If you&#39;re going to quote any resource, this
 761 # would be a good one.

 765 # From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
 766 # In 1946, DST in Taiwan was from May 15 and ended on Sep 30. The info from
 767 # Central Weather Bureau website was not correct.

 772 #
 773 # In 1947, DST in Taiwan was expanded to Oct 31. There is a backup of that
 774 # telegram announcement from Taiwan Province Government:

 777 #
 778 # Here is a brief translation:
 779 #
 780 #   The Summer Time this year is adopted from midnight Apr 15 until Sep 20
 781 #   midnight. To save (energy?) consumption, we&#39;re expanding Summer Time
 782 #   adoption till Oct 31 midnight.
 783 #
 784 # The Central Weather Bureau website didn&#39;t mention that, however it can
 785 # be found from historical government announcement database.
 786 
 787 # From Paul Eggert (2014-07-03):
 788 # As per Yu-Cheng Chuang, say that Taiwan was at UT +09 from 1937-10-01
 789 # until 1945-09-21 at 01:00, overriding Shanks &amp; Pottenger.

 821 #   A database for searching titles of legal documents of Macau in
 822 #   Chinese and Portuguese.  The term &quot;HORÁRIO DE VERÃO&quot; can be used for
 823 #   searching decrees about summer time.
 824 # * Archives of Macao
 825 #   http://www.archives.gov.mo/en/bo/
 826 #   It contains images of old official gazettes.
 827 # * The Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau have a page listing the
 828 #   summer time history.  But it is not complete and has some mistakes.
 829 #   http://www.smg.gov.mo/smg/geophysics/e_t_Summer%20Time.htm
 830 # Macau adopted GMT+8 on 30 Oct 1904 to follow Hong Kong.  Clocks were
 831 # advanced by 25 minutes and 50 seconds.  Which means the LMT used was
 832 # +7:34:10.  As stated in the &quot;Portaria No. 204&quot; dated 21 October 1904
 833 # and published in the Official Gazette on 29 October 1904.

1002 # Today&#39;s _Economist_ (p 60) reports that Georgia moved its clocks forward
1003 # an hour recently, due to a law proposed by Zurab Murvanidze,
1004 # an MP who went on a hunger strike for 11 days to force discussion about it!
1005 # We have no details, but we&#39;ll guess they didn&#39;t move the clocks back in fall.
1006 #
1007 # From Mathew Englander, quoting AP (1996-10-23 13:05-04):
1008 # Instead of putting back clocks at the end of October, Georgia
1009 # will stay on daylight savings time this winter to save energy,
1010 # President Eduard Shevardnadze decreed Wednesday.
1011 #
1012 # From the BBC via Joseph S. Myers (2004-06-27):
1013 #
1014 # Georgia moved closer to Western Europe on Sunday...  The former Soviet
1015 # republic has changed its time zone back to that of Moscow.  As a result it
1016 # is now just four hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time, rather than five hours
1017 # ahead.  The switch was decreed by the pro-Western president of Georgia,
1018 # Mikheil Saakashvili, who said the change was partly prompted by the process
1019 # of integration into Europe.
1020 
1021 # From Teimuraz Abashidze (2005-11-07):
1022 # Government of Georgia ... decided to NOT CHANGE daylight savings time on
1023 # [Oct.] 30, as it was done before during last more than 10 years.
1024 # Currently, we are in fact GMT +4:00, as before 30 October it was GMT
1025 # +3:00.... The problem is, there is NO FORMAL LAW or governmental document
1026 # about it.  As far as I can find, I was told, that there is no document,
1027 # because we just DIDN&#39;T ISSUE document about switching to winter time....
1028 # I don&#39;t know what can be done, especially knowing that some years ago our

1084 # In January 1906, several thousand cotton-mill workers rioted on the

1088 
1089 # From Paul Eggert (2017-04-20):
1090 # Good luck trying to nail down old timekeeping records in India.
1091 # &quot;... in the nineteenth century ... Madras Observatory took its magnetic
1092 # measurements on Göttingen time, its meteorological measurements on Madras
1093 # (local) time, dropped its time ball on Greenwich (ocean navigator&#39;s) time,
1094 # and distributed civil (local time).&quot; -- Bartky IR. Selling the true time:
1095 # 19th-century timekeeping in america. Stanford U Press (2000), 247 note 19.
1096 # &quot;A more potent cause of resistance to the general adoption of the present
1097 # standard time lies in the fact that it is Madras time.  The citizen of
1098 # Bombay, proud of being &#39;primus in Indis&#39; and of Calcutta, equally proud of
1099 # his city being the Capital of India, and - for a part of the year - the Seat
1100 # of the Supreme Government, alike look down on Madras, and refuse to change
1101 # the time they are using, for that of what they regard as a benighted
1102 # Presidency; while Madras, having for long given the standard time to the
1103 # rest of India, would resist the adoption of any other Indian standard in its
1104 # place.&quot; -- Oldham RD. On Time in India: a suggestion for its improvement.

1106 #
1107 # &quot;In 1870 ... Madras time - &#39;now used by the telegraph and regulated from the
1108 # only government observatory&#39; - was suggested as a standard railway time,
1109 # first to be adopted on the Great Indian Peninsular Railway (GIPR)....

1116 # This lists +052110 as Madras local time used in railways, and says that on
1117 # 1906-01-01 railways and telegraphs in India switched to +0530.  Some
1118 # municipalities retained their former time, and the time in Calcutta
1119 # continued to depend on whether you were at the railway station or at

1121 # at +0554 (according to the Indian Year Book).  Railway time is more
1122 # appropriate for our purposes, as it was better documented, it is what we do
1123 # elsewhere (e.g., Europe/London before 1880), and after 1906 it was
1124 # consistent in the region now identified by Asia/Kolkata.  So, use railway
1125 # time for 1870-1941.  Shanks is our only (and dubious) source for the

1218 # This is an English translation of what I just found (originally in Persian).
1219 # The Gregorian dates in brackets are mine:
1220 #
1221 #	Official Newspaper No. 13548-1370/6/25 [1991-09-16]
1222 #	No. 16760/T233 H				1370/6/10 [1991-09-01]
1223 #
1224 #	The Rule About Change of the Official Time of the Country
1225 #
1226 #	The Board of Ministers, in the meeting dated 1370/5/23 [1991-08-14],
1227 #	based on the suggestion number 2221/D dated 1370/4/22 [1991-07-13]
1228 #	of the Country&#39;s Organization for Official and Employment Affairs,
1229 #	and referring to the law for equating the working hours of workers
1230 #	and officers in the whole country dated 1359/4/23 [1980-07-14], and
1231 #	for synchronizing the official times of the country, agreed that:
1232 #
1233 #	The official time of the country will should move forward one hour
1234 #	at the 24[:00] hours of the first day of Farvardin and should return
1235 #	to its previous state at the 24[:00] hours of the 30th day of
1236 #	Shahrivar.
1237 #
1238 #	First Deputy to the President - Hassan Habibi
1239 #
1240 # From personal experience, that agrees with what has been followed
1241 # for at least the last 5 years.  Before that, for a few years, the
1242 # date used was the first Thursday night of Farvardin and the last
1243 # Thursday night of Shahrivar, but I can&#39;t give exact dates....
1244 #
1245 # From Roozbeh Pournader (2005-04-05):
1246 # The text of the Iranian law, in effect since 1925, clearly mentions
1247 # that the true solar year is the measure, and there is no arithmetic
1248 # leap year calculation involved.  There has never been any serious
1249 # plan to change that law....
1250 #
1251 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
1252 # Go with Shanks &amp; Pottenger before Sept. 1991, and with Pournader thereafter.
1253 # I used Ed Reingold&#39;s cal-persia in GNU Emacs 21.2 to check Persian dates,
1254 # stopping after 2037 when 32-bit time_t&#39;s overflow.
1255 # That cal-persia used Birashk&#39;s approximation, which disagrees with the solar
1256 # calendar predictions for the year 2025, so I corrected those dates by hand.
1257 #
1258 # From Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-03-30), writing about future
1259 # discrepancies between cal-persia and the Iranian calendar:
1260 # For 2091 solar-longitude-after yields 2091-03-20 08:40:07.7 UT for
1261 # the vernal equinox and that gets so close to 12:00 some local
1262 # Iranian time that the definition of the correct location needs to be
1263 # known exactly, amongst other factors.  2157 is even closer:
1264 # 2157-03-20 08:37:15.5 UT.  But the Gregorian year 2025 should give
1265 # no interpretation problem whatsoever.  By the way, another instant
1266 # in the near future where there will be a discrepancy between
1267 # arithmetical and astronomical Iranian calendars will be in 2058:
1268 # vernal equinox on 2058-03-20 09:03:05.9 UT.  The Java version of
1269 # Reingold&#39;s/Dershowitz&#39; calculator gives correctly the Gregorian date
1270 # 2058-03-21 for 1 Farvardin 1437 (astronomical).
1271 #

1357 # From Jonathan Lennox (2000-06-12):
1358 # An article in this week&#39;s Economist (&quot;Inside the Saddam-free zone&quot;, p. 50 in
1359 # the U.S. edition) on the Iraqi Kurds contains a paragraph:
1360 # &quot;The three northern provinces ... switched their clocks this spring and
1361 # are an hour ahead of Baghdad.&quot;
1362 #
1363 # But Rives McDow (2000-06-18) quotes a contact in Iraqi-Kurdistan as follows:
1364 # In the past, some Kurdish nationalists, as a protest to the Iraqi
1365 # Government, did not adhere to daylight saving time.  They referred
1366 # to daylight saving as Saddam time.  But, as of today, the time zone
1367 # in Iraqi-Kurdistan is on standard time with Baghdad, Iraq.
1368 #
1369 # So we&#39;ll ignore the Economist&#39;s claim.

1403 # From Ephraim Silverberg (2001-01-11):
1404 #
1405 # I coined &quot;IST/IDT&quot; circa 1988.  Until then there were three
1406 # different abbreviations in use:
1407 #
1408 # JST  Jerusalem Standard Time [Danny Braniss, Hebrew University]
1409 # IZT  Israel Zonal (sic) Time [Prof. Haim Papo, Technion]
1410 # EEST Eastern Europe Standard Time [used by almost everyone else]
1411 #
1412 # Since timezones should be called by country and not capital cities,
1413 # I ruled out JST.  As Israel is in Asia Minor and not Eastern Europe,
1414 # EEST was equally unacceptable.  Since &quot;zonal&quot; was not compatible with
1415 # any other timezone abbreviation, I felt that &#39;IST&#39; was the way to go
1416 # and, indeed, it has received almost universal acceptance in timezone
1417 # settings in Israeli computers.
1418 #
1419 # In any case, I am happy to share timezone abbreviations with India,
1420 # high on my favorite-country list (and not only because my wife&#39;s
1421 # family is from India).

1471 # From Ephraim Silverberg
1472 # (1997-03-04, 1998-03-16, 1998-12-28, 2000-01-17, 2000-07-25, 2004-12-22,
1473 # and 2005-02-17):
1474 
1475 # According to the Office of the Secretary General of the Ministry of
1476 # Interior, there is NO set rule for Daylight-Savings/Standard time changes.
1477 # One thing is entrenched in law, however: that there must be at least 150
1478 # days of daylight savings time annually.  From 1993-1998, the change to
1479 # daylight savings time was on a Friday morning from midnight IST to
1480 # 1 a.m IDT; up until 1998, the change back to standard time was on a
1481 # Saturday night from midnight daylight savings time to 11 p.m. standard
1482 # time.  1996 is an exception to this rule where the change back to standard
1483 # time took place on Sunday night instead of Saturday night to avoid
1484 # conflicts with the Jewish New Year.  In 1999, the change to
1485 # daylight savings time was still on a Friday morning but from
1486 # 2 a.m. IST to 3 a.m. IDT; furthermore, the change back to standard time
1487 # was also on a Friday morning from 2 a.m. IDT to 1 a.m. IST for
1488 # 1999 only.  In the year 2000, the change to daylight savings time was
1489 # similar to 1999, but although the change back will be on a Friday, it
1490 # will take place from 1 a.m. IDT to midnight IST.  Starting in 2001, all
1491 # changes to/from will take place at 1 a.m. old time, but now there is no
1492 # rule as to what day of the week it will take place in as the start date
1493 # (except in 2003) is the night after the Passover Seder (i.e. the eve
1494 # of the 16th of Nisan in the lunar Hebrew calendar) and the end date
1495 # (except in 2002) is three nights before Yom Kippur [Day of Atonement]
1496 # (the eve of the 7th of Tishrei in the lunar Hebrew calendar).

1821 # &lt;http://www.kazsociety.org.uk/news/2005/03/30.htm&gt; (2005-03-21):
1822 # The Government of Kazakhstan passed a resolution March 15 abolishing
1823 # daylight saving time citing lack of economic benefits and health
1824 # complications coupled with a decrease in productivity.
1825 #
1826 # From Branislav Kojic (in Astana) via Gwillim Law (2005-06-28):
1827 # ... what happened was that the former Kazakhstan Eastern time zone
1828 # was &quot;blended&quot; with the Central zone.  Therefore, Kazakhstan now has
1829 # two time zones, and difference between them is one hour.  The zone
1830 # closer to UTC is the former Western zone (probably still called the
1831 # same), encompassing four provinces in the west: Aqtöbe, Atyraū,
1832 # Mangghystaū, and West Kazakhstan.  The other zone encompasses
1833 # everything else....  I guess that would make Kazakhstan time zones
1834 # de jure UTC+5 and UTC+6 respectively.
1835 
1836 # From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-27):
1837 # Review of the linked documents from http://adilet.zan.kz/

1839 #
1840 # 0. Act of the Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR
1841 # from 1991-02-04 No. 20
1842 # http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&amp;nd=102010545
1843 # removed the extra hour (&quot;decree time&quot;) on the territory of the USSR
1844 # starting with the last Sunday of March 1991.
1845 # It also allowed (but not mandated) Kazakh SSR, Kirghiz SSR, Tajik SSR,
1846 # Turkmen SSR and Uzbek SSR to not have &quot;summer&quot; time.
1847 #
1848 # The 1992-01-13 act also refers to the act of the Cabinet of Ministers

1850 # of Ministers of the USSR from 1991-02-04 No. 20&quot; but I didn&#39;t found its
1851 # text.
1852 #
1853 # According to Izvestia newspaper No. 68 (23334) from 1991-03-20
1854 # (page 6; available at http://libinfo.org/newsr/newsr2574.djvu via

1857 # Republic of Georgia, Latvian SSR, Lithuanian SSR, SSR Moldova,
1858 # Estonian SSR; Komi ASSR; Kaliningrad oblast; Nenets autonomous okrug
1859 # were to move clocks 1 hour forward.
1860 # Kazakh SSR (excluding Uralsk oblast); Republic of Kyrgyzstan, Tajik
1861 # SSR; Andijan, Jizzakh, Namangan, Sirdarya, Tashkent, Fergana oblasts
1862 # of the Uzbek SSR were to move clocks 1 hour backwards.
1863 # Other territories were to not move clocks.
1864 # When the &quot;summer&quot; time would end on 1991-09-29, clocks were to be
1865 # moved 1 hour backwards on the territory of the USSR excluding
1866 # Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Tajikistan.
1867 #
1868 # Apparently there were last minute changes. Apparently Kazakh act No. 170
1869 # was one of such changes.
1870 #
1871 # https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Декретное время
1872 # claims that Sovetskaya Rossiya newspaper on 1991-03-29 published that
1873 # Nenets autonomous okrug, Komi and Kazakhstan (excluding Uralsk oblast)
1874 # were to not move clocks and Uralsk oblast was to move clocks
1875 # forward; on 1991-09-29 Kazakhstan was to move clocks backwards.
1876 # (Probably there were changes even after that publication. There is an
1877 # article claiming that Kaliningrad oblast decided on 1991-03-29 to not
1878 # move clocks.)
1879 #
1880 # This implies that on 1991-03-31 Asia/Oral remained on +04/+05 while
1881 # the rest of Kazakhstan switched from +06/+07 to +05/06 or from +05/06
1882 # to +04/+05. It&#39;s unclear how Qyzylorda oblast moved into the fifth

1890 # 1992-01-08 act.  It specified that time would be calculated

1892 # on the whole territory of Kazakhstan 1 hour forward on 1992-01-19 at
1893 # 2:00, specified DST rules.  It acknowledged that Kazakhstan was
1894 # located in the fourth and the fifth time belts and specified the
1895 # border between them to be located east of Qostanay and Aktyubinsk
1896 # oblasts (notably including Turgai and Qyzylorda oblasts into the fifth
1897 # time belt).
1898 #
1899 # This means switch on 1992-01-19 at 2:00 from +04/+05 to +05/+06 for

2299 # General Information Mongolia
2300 # &lt;http://www.mongoliatourism.gov.mn/general.htm&gt; (1999-09)
2301 # &quot;Time: Mongolia has two time zones. Three westernmost provinces of
2302 # Bayan-Ölgii, Uvs, and Hovd are one hour earlier than the capital city, and
2303 # the rest of the country follows the Ulaanbaatar time, which is UTC/GMT plus
2304 # eight hours.&quot;
2305 
2306 # From Rives McDow (1999-12-13):
2307 # Mongolia discontinued the use of daylight savings time in 1999; 1998
2308 # being the last year it was implemented.  The dates of implementation I am
2309 # unsure of, but most probably it was similar to Russia, except for the time
2310 # of implementation may have been different....
2311 # Some maps in the past have indicated that there was an additional time
2312 # zone in the eastern part of Mongolia, including the provinces of Dornod,
2313 # Sükhbaatar, and possibly Khentii.
2314 
2315 # From Paul Eggert (1999-12-15):
2316 # Naming and spelling is tricky in Mongolia.
2317 # We&#39;ll use Hovd (also spelled Chovd and Khovd) to represent the west zone;
2318 # the capital of the Hovd province is sometimes called Hovd, sometimes Dund-Us,
2319 # and sometimes Jirgalanta (with variant spellings), but the name Hovd
2320 # is good enough for our purposes.

2323 # In addition to Mongolia starting daylight savings as reported earlier
2324 # (adopted DST on 2001-04-27 02:00 local time, ending 2001-09-28),

2608 # From Amos Shapir (1998-02-15):
2609 #
2610 # From 1917 until 1948-05-15, all of Palestine, including the parts now
2611 # known as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, was under British rule.
2612 # Therefore the rules given for Israel for that period, apply there too...
2613 #
2614 # The Gaza Strip was under Egyptian rule between 1948-05-15 until 1967-06-05
2615 # (except a short occupation by Israel from 1956-11 till 1957-03, but no
2616 # time zone was affected then).  It was never formally annexed to Egypt,
2617 # though.
2618 #
2619 # The rest of Palestine was under Jordanian rule at that time, formally
2620 # annexed in 1950 as the West Bank (and the word &quot;Trans&quot; was dropped from
2621 # the country&#39;s previous name of &quot;the Hashemite Kingdom of the
2622 # Trans-Jordan&quot;).  So the rules for Jordan for that time apply.  Major
2623 # towns in that area are Nablus (Shchem), El-Halil (Hebron), Ramallah, and
2624 # East Jerusalem.
2625 #
2626 # Both areas were occupied by Israel in June 1967, but not annexed (except
2627 # for East Jerusalem).  They were on Israel time since then; there might
2628 # have been a Military Governor&#39;s order about time zones, but I&#39;m not aware
2629 # of any (such orders may have been issued semi-annually whenever summer
2630 # time was in effect, but maybe the legal aspect of time was just neglected).
2631 #
2632 # The Palestinian Authority was established in 1993, and got hold of most

2654 # We don&#39;t yet need a separate entry for the West Bank, since
2655 # the only differences between it and Gaza that we know about
2656 # occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.

2966 # In the Philippines, there is a national law, Republic Act No. 10535
2967 # which declares the official time here as &quot;Philippine Standard Time&quot;.
2968 # The act [1] even specifies use of PST as the abbreviation, although

3003 #
3004 # From Paul Eggert (2018-08-29):
3005 # Time in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian peninsula was not
3006 # standardized until 1968 or so; we don&#39;t know exactly when, and possibly it
3007 # has never been made official.  Richard P Hunt, in &quot;Islam city yielding to
3008 # modern times&quot;, New York Times (1961-04-09), p 20, wrote that only airlines
3009 # observed standard time, and that people in Jeddah mostly observed quasi-solar
3010 # time, doing so by setting their watches at sunrise to 6 o&#39;clock (or to 12
3011 # o&#39;clock for &quot;Arab&quot; time).
3012 #
3013 # Timekeeping differed depending on who you were and which part of Saudi
3014 # Arabia you were in.  In 1969, Elias Antar wrote that although a common
3015 # practice had been to set one&#39;s watch to 12:00 (i.e., midnight) at sunset -
3016 # which meant that the time on one side of a mountain could differ greatly from
3017 # the time on the other side - many foreigners set their watches to 6pm
3018 # instead, while airlines instead used UTC +03 (except in Dhahran, where they
3019 # used UTC +04), Aramco used UTC +03 with DST, and the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line
3020 # Company used Aramco time in eastern Saudi Arabia and airline time in western.
3021 # (The American Military Aid Advisory Group used plain UTC.)  Antar writes,
3022 # &quot;A man named Higgins, so the story goes, used to run a local power
3023 # station. One day, the whole thing became too much for Higgins and he
3024 # assembled his staff and laid down the law. &#39;I&#39;ve had enough of this,&#39; he
3025 # shrieked. &#39;It is now 12 o&#39;clock Higgins Time, and from now on this station is
3026 # going to run on Higgins Time.&#39; And so, until last year, it did.&quot;  See:
3027 # Antar E. Dinner at When? Saudi Aramco World, 1969 March/April. 2-3.
3028 # http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/196902/dinner.at.when.htm
3029 # newspapers.com says a similar story about Higgins was published in the Port
3030 # Angeles (WA) Evening News, 1965-03-10, page 5, but I lack access to the text.
3031 #
3032 # The TZ database cannot represent quasi-solar time; airline time is the best
3033 # we can do.  The 1946 foreign air news digest of the U.S. Civil Aeronautics
3034 # Board (OCLC 42299995) reported that the &quot;... Arabian Government, inaugurated
3035 # a weekly Dhahran-Cairo service, via the Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and
3036 # Jidda, on March 14, 1947&quot;.  Shanks &amp; Pottenger guessed 1950; go with the
3037 # earlier date.
3038 #
3039 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger also state that until 1968-05-01 Saudi Arabia had two
3040 # time zones; the other zone, at UT +04, was in the far eastern part of
3041 # the country.  Presumably this is documenting airline time.  Ignore this,
3042 # as it&#39;s before our 1970 cutoff.

3342 # From Paul Eggert (2014-10-04):
3343 # Milne gives 7:16:56 for the meridian of Saigon in 1899, as being
3344 # used in Lower Laos, Cambodia, and Annam.  But this is quite a ways
3345 # from Saigon&#39;s location.  For now, ignore this and stick with Shanks
3346 # and Pottenger for LMT before 1906.
3347 
3348 # From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-18):
3349 # The English-language name of Vietnam&#39;s most populous city is &quot;Ho Chi Minh
3350 # City&quot;; use Ho_Chi_Minh below to avoid a name of more than 14 characters.
3351 
3352 # From Paul Eggert (2014-10-21) after a heads-up from Trần Ngọc Quân:
3353 # Trần Tiến Bình&#39;s authoritative book &quot;Lịch Việt Nam: thế kỷ XX-XXI (1901-2100)&quot;
3354 # (Nhà xuất bản Văn Hoá - Thông Tin, Hanoi, 2005), pp 49-50,
3355 # is quoted verbatim in:
3356 # http://www.thoigian.com.vn/?mPage=P80D01
3357 # is translated by Brian Inglis in:
3358 # https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2014-October/021654.html
3359 # and is the basis for the information below.
3360 #
3361 # The 1906 transition was effective July 1 and standardized Indochina to
3362 # Phù Liễn Observatory, legally 104° 17&#39; 17&quot; east of Paris.
3363 # It&#39;s unclear whether this meant legal Paris Mean Time (00:09:21) or
3364 # the Paris Meridian (2° 20&#39; 14.03&quot; E); the former yields 07:06:30.1333...
3365 # and the latter 07:06:29.333... so either way it rounds to 07:06:30,
3366 # which is used below even though the modern-day Phù Liễn Observatory
3367 # is closer to 07:06:31.  Abbreviate Phù Liễn Mean Time as PLMT.
3368 #
3369 # The following transitions occurred in Indochina in general (before 1954)
3370 # and in South Vietnam in particular (after 1954):
3371 # To 07:00 on 1911-05-01.
3372 # To 08:00 on 1942-12-31 at 23:00.
3373 # To 09:00 in 1945-03-14 at 23:00.
3374 # To 07:00 on 1945-09-02 in Vietnam.
3375 # To 08:00 on 1947-04-01 in French-controlled Indochina.
3376 # To 07:00 on 1955-07-01 in South Vietnam.
3377 # To 08:00 on 1959-12-31 at 23:00 in South Vietnam.
3378 # To 07:00 on 1975-06-13 in South Vietnam.
