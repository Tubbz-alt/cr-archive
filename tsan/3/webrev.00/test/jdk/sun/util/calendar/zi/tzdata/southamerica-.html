  37 # Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
  38 #
  39 # Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
  40 # for time zone data was the International Air Transport
  41 # Association&#39;s Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
  42 # published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
  43 # of the IATA&#39;s data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
  44 # IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
  45 #
  46 # For data circa 1899, a common source is:
  47 # Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899 Feb;13(2):173-94.
  48 # https://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359

  50 # These tables use numeric abbreviations like -03 and -0330 for
  51 # integer hour and minute UT offsets.  Although earlier editions used
  52 # alphabetic time zone abbreviations, these abbreviations were
  53 # invented and did not reflect common practice.

 126 # The law that claimed DST for Argentina was derogated by President Fernando

 128 # in the winter time, rather than less.  The change took effect on March 3.

 242 # The following eight (8) provinces pulled clocks back to UTC-04:00 at
 243 # midnight Monday May 31st. (that is, the night between 05/31 and 06/01).
 244 # Apparently, all nine provinces would go back to UTC-03:00 at the same
 245 # time in October 17th.
 246 #
 247 # Catamarca, Chubut, La Rioja, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Cruz,
 248 # Tierra del Fuego, Tucumán.
 249 #
 250 # From Mariano Absatz (2004-06-14):
 251 # ... this weekend, the Province of Tucumán decided it&#39;d go back to UTC-03:00
 252 # yesterday midnight (that is, at 24:00 Saturday 12th), since the people&#39;s
 253 # annoyance with the change is much higher than the power savings obtained....

 255 # From Gwillim Law (2004-06-14):
 256 # http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/06/10/de_609078.asp ...
 257 #     &quot;The time change in Tierra del Fuego was a conflicted decision from
 258 #   the start.  The government had decreed that the measure would take
 259 #   effect on June 1, but a normative error forced the new time to begin
 260 #   three days earlier, from a Saturday to a Sunday....
 261 # Our understanding was that the change was originally scheduled to take place
 262 # on June 1 at 00:00 in Chubut, Santa Cruz, Tierra del Fuego (and some other
 263 # provinces).  Sunday was May 30, only two days earlier.  So the article
 264 # contains a contradiction.  I would give more credence to the Saturday/Sunday
 265 # date than the &quot;three days earlier&quot; phrase, and conclude that Tierra del
 266 # Fuego set its clocks back at 2004-05-30 00:00.
 267 #
 268 # From Steffen Thorsen (2004-10-05):
 269 # The previous law 7210 which changed the province of Mendoza&#39;s time zone

 297 # The page of the San Luis provincial government
 298 # http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/notas.asp?idCanal=0&amp;id=22812
 299 # confirms what Alex Krivenyshev has earlier sent to the tz
 300 # emailing list about that San Luis plans to return to standard
 301 # time much earlier than the rest of the country. It also
 302 # confirms that upon request the provinces San Juan and Mendoza
 303 # refused to follow San Luis in this change.
 304 #
 305 # The change is supposed to take place Monday the 21st at 0:00
 306 # hours. As far as I understand it if this goes ahead, we need
 307 # a new timezone for San Luis (although there are also documented
 308 # independent changes in the southamerica file of San Luis in
 309 # 1990 and 1991 which has not been confirmed).
 310 
 311 # From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-01-25):
 312 # Unfortunately the below page has become defunct, about the San Luis
 313 # time change. Perhaps because it now is part of a group of pages &quot;Most

 318 # instead it seems. Or use &quot;Buscador&quot; from the main page of the San Luis
 319 # government, and fill in &quot;huso&quot; and click OK, and you will get 3 pages
 320 # from which the first one is identical to the above.
 321 
 322 # From Mariano Absatz (2008-01-28):
 323 # I can confirm that the Province of San Luis (and so far only that
 324 # province) decided to go back to UTC-3 effective midnight Jan 20th 2008
 325 # (that is, Monday 21st at 0:00 is the time the clocks were delayed back
 326 # 1 hour), and they intend to keep UTC-3 as their timezone all year round
 327 # (that is, unless they change their mind any minute now).
 328 #
 329 # So we&#39;ll have to add yet another city to &#39;southamerica&#39; (I think San
 330 # Luis city is the mos populated city in the Province, so it&#39;d be
 331 # America/Argentina/San_Luis... of course I can&#39;t remember if San Luis&#39;s
 332 # history of particular changes goes along with Mendoza or San Juan :-(
 333 # (I only remember not being able to collect hard facts about San Luis
 334 # back in 2004, when these provinces changed to UTC-4 for a few days, I
 335 # mailed them personally and never got an answer).

 340 # America/Cordoba split into 6 subregions during 1991/1992, one of which
 341 # was America/San_Luis, but we haven&#39;t verified this yet so for now we&#39;ll

 359 # ... announced that next Sunday, at 00:00, Puntanos (the San Luis
 360 # inhabitants) will have to turn back one hour their clocks
 361 #
 362 # Since then, San Luis will establish its own Province timezone. Thus,
 363 # during 2009, this timezone change will run from 00:00 the third Sunday
 364 # in March until 24:00 of the second Saturday in October.
 365 
 366 # From Mariano Absatz (2009-10-16):
 367 # ...the Province of San Luis is a case in itself.
 368 #
 369 # The Law at
 370 # http://www.diputadossanluis.gov.ar/diputadosasp/paginas/verNorma.asp?NormaID=276
 371 # is ambiguous because establishes a calendar from the 2nd Sunday in
 372 # October at 0:00 thru the 2nd Saturday in March at 24:00 and the
 373 # complement of that starting on the 2nd Sunday of March at 0:00 and
 374 # ending on the 2nd Saturday of March at 24:00.
 375 #
 376 # This clearly breaks every time the 1st of March or October is a Sunday.
 377 #
 378 # IMHO, the &quot;spirit of the Law&quot; is to make the changes at 0:00 on the 2nd
 379 # Sunday of October and March.
 380 #
 381 # The problem is that the changes in the rest of the Provinces that did
 382 # change in 2007/2008, were made according to the Federal Law and Decrees
 383 # that did so on the 3rd Sunday of October and March.
 384 #
 385 # In fact, San Luis actually switched from UTC-4 to UTC-3 last Sunday
 386 # (October 11th) at 0:00.
 387 #
 388 # So I guess a new set of rules, besides &quot;Arg&quot;, must be made and the last
 389 # America/Argentina/San_Luis entries should change to use these...
 390 # ...
 391 
 392 # From Alexander Krivenyshev (2010-04-09):
 393 # According to news reports from El Diario de la República Province San
 394 # Luis, Argentina (standard time UTC-04) will keep Daylight Saving Time
 395 # after April 11, 2010 - will continue to have same time as rest of
 396 # Argentina (UTC-3) (no DST).
 397 #

 401 # http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_argentina08.html
 402 
 403 # From Mariano Absatz (2010-04-12):
 404 # yes...I can confirm this...and given that San Luis keeps calling
 405 # UTC-03:00 &quot;summer time&quot;, we should&#39;t just let San Luis go back to &quot;Arg&quot;
 406 # rules...San Luis is still using &quot;Western ARgentina Time&quot; and it got
 407 # stuck on Summer daylight savings time even though the summer is over.
 408 
 409 # From Paul Eggert (2018-01-23):
 410 # Perhaps San Luis operates on the legal fiction that it is at -04
 411 # with perpetual daylight saving time, but ordinary usage typically seems to
 412 # just say it&#39;s at -03; see, for example,
 413 # https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hora_oficial_argentina
 414 # We&#39;ve documented similar situations as being plain changes to
 415 # standard time, so let&#39;s do that here too.  This does not change UTC
 416 # offsets, only tm_isdst and the time zone abbreviations.  One minor
 417 # plus is that this silences a zic complaint that there&#39;s no POSIX TZ
 418 # setting for timestamps past 2038.

 608 
 609 # From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
 610 # The mayor of Rio recently attempted to change the time zone rules
 611 # just in his city, in order to leave more summer time for the tourist trade.
 612 # The rule change lasted only part of the day;
 613 # the federal government refused to follow the city&#39;s rules, and business
 614 # was in a chaos, so the mayor backed down that afternoon.
 615 
 616 # From IATA SSIM (1996-02):
 617 # _Only_ the following states in BR1 observe DST: Rio Grande do Sul (RS),
 618 # Santa Catarina (SC), Paraná (PR), São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ),
 619 # Espírito Santo (ES), Minas Gerais (MG), Bahia (BA), Goiás (GO),
 620 # Distrito Federal (DF), Tocantins (TO), Sergipe [SE] and Alagoas [AL].
 621 # [The last three states are new to this issue of the IATA SSIM.]
 622 
 623 # From Gwillim Law (1996-10-07):
 624 # Geography, history (Tocantins was part of Goiás until 1989), and other
 625 # sources of time zone information lead me to believe that AL, SE, and TO were
 626 # always in BR1, and so the only change was whether or not they observed DST....
 627 # The earliest issue of the SSIM I have is 2/91.  Each issue from then until
 628 # 9/95 says that DST is observed only in the ten states I quoted from 9/95,
 629 # along with Mato Grosso (MT) and Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), which are in BR2
 630 # (UTC-4)....  The other two time zones given for Brazil are BR3, which is
 631 # UTC-5, no DST, and applies only in the state of Acre (AC); and BR4, which is
 632 # UTC-2, and applies to Fernando de Noronha (formerly FN, but I believe it&#39;s
 633 # become part of the state of Pernambuco).  The boundary between BR1 and BR2
 634 # has never been clearly stated.  They&#39;ve simply been called East and West.
 635 # However, some conclusions can be drawn from another IATA manual: the Airline
 636 # Coding Directory, which lists close to 400 airports in Brazil.  For each
 637 # airport it gives a time zone which is coded to the SSIM.  From that
 638 # information, I&#39;m led to conclude that the states of Amapá (AP), Ceará (CE),
 639 # Maranhão (MA), Paraíba (PR), Pernambuco (PE), Piauí (PI), and Rio Grande do
 640 # Norte (RN), and the eastern part of Pará (PA) are all in BR1 without DST.

 643 # Brazilian official page &lt;http://pcdsh01.on.br/verao1.html&gt;
 644 
 645 # From Jesper Nørgaard (2000-11-03):

 648 # http://pcdsh01.on.br/Fusbrhv.htm
 649 
 650 # From Celso Doria via David Madeo (2002-10-09):
 651 # The reason for the delay this year has to do with elections in Brazil.
 652 #
 653 # Unlike in the United States, elections in Brazil are 100% computerized and
 654 # the results are known almost immediately.  Yesterday, it was the first
 655 # round of the elections when 115 million Brazilians voted for President,
 656 # Governor, Senators, Federal Deputies, and State Deputies.  Nobody is
 657 # counting (or re-counting) votes anymore and we know there will be a second
 658 # round for the Presidency and also for some Governors.  The 2nd round will
 659 # take place on October 27th.
 660 #
 661 # The reason why the DST will only begin November 3rd is that the thousands
 662 # of electoral machines used cannot have their time changed, and since the
 663 # Constitution says the elections must begin at 8:00 AM and end at 5:00 PM,
 664 # the Government decided to postpone DST, instead of changing the Constitution
 665 # (maybe, for the next elections, it will be possible to change the clock)...
 666 
 667 # From Rodrigo Severo (2004-10-04):
 668 # It&#39;s just the biannual change made necessary by the much hyped, supposedly
 669 # modern Brazilian eletronic voting machines which, apparently, can&#39;t deal
 670 # with a time change between the first and the second rounds of the elections.
 671 
 672 # From Steffen Thorsen (2007-09-20):
 673 # Brazil will start DST on 2007-10-14 00:00 and end on 2008-02-17 00:00:

 675 
 676 # From Paul Schulze (2008-06-24):
 677 # ...by law number 11.662 of April 24, 2008 (published in the &quot;Diario
 678 # Oficial da União&quot;...) in Brazil there are changes in the timezones,
 679 # effective today (00:00am at June 24, 2008) as follows:
 680 #
 681 # a) The timezone UTC+5 is extinguished, with all the Acre state and the
 682 # part of the Amazonas state that had this timezone now being put to the
 683 # timezone UTC+4
 684 # b) The whole Pará state now is put at timezone UTC+3, instead of just
 685 # part of it, as was before.
 686 #
 687 # This change follows a proposal of senator Tiao Viana of Acre state, that
 688 # proposed it due to concerns about open television channels displaying
 689 # programs inappropriate to youths in the states that had the timezone
 690 # UTC+5 too early in the night. In the occasion, some more corrections
 691 # were proposed, trying to unify the timezones of any given state. This
 692 # change modifies timezone rules defined in decree 2.784 of 18 June,
 693 # 1913.
 694 
 695 # From Rodrigo Severo (2008-06-24):
 696 # Just correcting the URL:
 697 # https://www.in.gov.br/imprensa/visualiza/index.jsp?jornal=do&amp;secao=1&amp;pagina=1&amp;data=25/04/2008
 698 #
 699 # As a result of the above Decree I believe the America/Rio_Branco
 700 # timezone shall be modified from UTC-5 to UTC-4 and a new timezone shall
 701 # be created to represent the...west side of the Pará State. I
 702 # suggest this new timezone be called Santarem as the most

1112 # From Paul Eggert (2015-04-03):
1113 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger says America/Santiago introduced standard time in
1114 # 1890 and rounds its UT offset to 70W40; guess that in practice this
1115 # was the same offset as in 1916-1919.  It also says Pacific/Easter
1116 # standardized on 109W22 in 1890; assume this didn&#39;t change the clocks.
1117 #
1118 # Dates for America/Santiago from 1910 to 2004 are primarily from
1119 # the following source, cited by Oscar van Vlijmen (2006-10-08):
1120 # [1] Chile Law

1124 # https://web.archive.org/web/20080330200901/http://www.horaoficial.cl/cambio.htm
1125 # [1] needs several corrections, though.
1126 #
1127 # The first set of corrections is from:
1128 # [2] History of the Official Time of Chile
1129 # http://www.horaoficial.cl/ing/horaof_ing.html (retrieved 2012-03-06).  See:

1134 # A fancier Spanish version (requiring mouse-clicking) is at:
1135 # http://www.horaoficial.cl/historia_hora.html
1136 # Conflicts between [1] and [2] were resolved as follows:
1137 #
1138 #  - [1] says the 1910 transition was Jan 1, [2] says Jan 10 and cites
1139 #    Boletín No. 1, Aviso No. 1 (1910).  Go with [2].
1140 #
1141 #  - [1] says SMT was -4:42:45, [2] says Chile&#39;s official time from
1142 #    1916 to 1919 was -4:42:46.3, the meridian of Chile&#39;s National
1143 #    Astronomical Observatory (OAN), then located in what is now
1144 #    Quinta Normal in Santiago.  Go with [2], rounding it to -4:42:46.
1145 #
1146 #  - [1] says the 1918 transition was Sep 1, [2] says Sep 10 and cites
1147 #    Boletín No. 22, Aviso No. 129/1918 (1918-08-23).  Go with [2].
1148 #
1149 #  - [1] does not give times for transitions; assume they occur
1150 #    at midnight mainland time, the current common practice.  However,
1151 #    go with [2]&#39;s specification of 23:00 for the 1947-05-21 transition.
1152 #
1153 # Another correction to [1] is from Jesper Nørgaard Welen, who
1154 # wrote (2006-10-08), &quot;I think that there are some obvious mistakes in
1155 # the suggested link from Oscar van Vlijmen,... for instance entry 66
1156 # says that GMT-4 ended 1990-09-12 while entry 67 only begins GMT-3 at
1157 # 1990-09-15 (they should have been 1990-09-15 and 1990-09-16
1158 # respectively), but anyhow it clears up some doubts too.&quot;
1159 #
1160 # Data for Pacific/Easter from 1910 through 1967 come from Shanks &amp;
1161 # Pottenger.  After that, for lack of better info assume
1162 # Pacific/Easter is always two hours behind America/Santiago;
1163 # this is known to work for DST transitions starting in 2008 and
1164 # may well be true for earlier transitions.
1165 
1166 # From Eduardo Krell (1995-10-19):
1167 # The law says to switch to DST at midnight [24:00] on the second SATURDAY
1168 # of October....  The law is the same for March and October.
1169 # (1998-09-29):
1170 # Because of the drought this year, the government decided to go into
1171 # DST earlier (saturday 9/26 at 24:00). This is a one-time change only ...
1172 # (unless there&#39;s another dry season next year, I guess).
1173 
1174 # From Julio I. Pacheco Troncoso (1999-03-18):
1175 # Because of the same drought, the government decided to end DST later,
1176 # on April 3, (one-time change).
1177 
1178 # From Germán Poo-Caamaño (2008-03-03):
1179 # Due to drought, Chile extends Daylight Time in three weeks.  This
1180 # is one-time change (Saturday 3/29 at 24:00 for America/Santiago
1181 # and Saturday 3/29 at 22:00 for Pacific/Easter)

1210 # a. Saturday April 28, 2012, clocks should go back 60 minutes; that is, at

1468 
1469 # From Rives McDow (2001-02-13):
1470 #
1471 # I have communicated several times with people there, and the last
1472 # time I had communications that was helpful was in 1998.  Here is
1473 # what was said then:
1474 #
1475 # &quot;The general rule was that Stanley used daylight saving and the Camp
1476 # did not. However for various reasons many people in the Camp have
1477 # started to use daylight saving (known locally as &#39;Stanley Time&#39;)
1478 # There is no rule as to who uses daylight saving - it is a matter of
1479 # personal choice and so it is impossible to draw a map showing who
1480 # uses it and who does not. Any list would be out of date as soon as
1481 # it was produced. This year daylight saving ended on April 18/19th
1482 # and started again on September 12/13th.  I do not know what the rule
1483 # is, but can find out if you like.  We do not change at the same time
1484 # as UK or Chile.&quot;
1485 #
1486 # I did have in my notes that the rule was &quot;Second Saturday in Sep at
1487 # 0:00 until third Saturday in Apr at 0:00&quot;.  I think that this does
1488 # not agree in some cases with Shanks; is this true?
1489 #
1490 # Also, there is no mention in the list that some areas in the
1491 # Falklands do not use DST.  I have found in my communications there
1492 # that these areas are on the western half of East Falkland and all of
1493 # West Falkland.  Stanley is the only place that consistently observes
1494 # DST.  Again, as in other places in the world, the farmers don&#39;t like
1495 # it.  West Falkland is almost entirely sheep farmers.
1496 #
1497 # I know one lady there that keeps a list of which farm keeps DST and
1498 # which doesn&#39;t each year.  She runs a shop in Stanley, and says that
1499 # the list changes each year.  She uses it to communicate to her
1500 # customers, catching them when they are home for lunch or dinner.
1501 
1502 # From Paul Eggert (2001-03-05):
1503 # For now, we&#39;ll just record the time in Stanley, since we have no
1504 # better info.
1505 
1506 # From Steffen Thorsen (2011-04-01):
1507 # The Falkland Islands will not turn back clocks this winter, but stay on
1508 # daylight saving time.

1513 # We have gotten this confirmed by a clerk of the legislative assembly:
1514 # Normally the clocks revert to Local Mean Time (UTC/GMT -4 hours) on the
1515 # third Sunday of April at 0200hrs and advance to Summer Time (UTC/GMT -3
1516 # hours) on the first Sunday of September at 0200hrs.
1517 #
1518 # IMPORTANT NOTE: During 2011, on a trial basis, the Falkland Islands
1519 # will not revert to local mean time, but clocks will remain on Summer
1520 # time (UTC/GMT - 3 hours) throughout the whole of 2011.  Any long term
1521 # change to local time following the trial period will be notified.
1522 #
1523 # From Andrew Newman (2012-02-24)
1524 # A letter from Justin McPhee, Chief Executive,
1525 # Cable &amp; Wireless Falkland Islands (dated 2012-02-22)
1526 # states...
1527 #   The current Atlantic/Stanley entry under South America expects the
1528 #   clocks to go back to standard Falklands Time (FKT) on the 15th April.
1529 #   The database entry states that in 2011 Stanley was staying on fixed
1530 #   summer time on a trial basis only.  FIG need to contact IANA and/or
1531 #   the maintainers of the database to inform them we&#39;re adopting
1532 #   the same policy this year and suggest recommendations for future years.
1533 #
1534 # For now we will assume permanent -03 for the Falklands
1535 # until advised differently (to apply for 2012 and beyond, after the 2011
1536 # experiment was apparently successful.)
