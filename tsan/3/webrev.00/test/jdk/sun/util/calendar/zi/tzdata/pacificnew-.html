27 # From Arthur David Olson (1989-04-05):
28 # On 1989-04-05, the U. S. House of Representatives passed (238-154) a bill
29 # establishing &quot;Pacific Presidential Election Time&quot;; it was not acted on
30 # by the Senate or signed into law by the President.
31 # You might want to change the &quot;PE&quot; (Presidential Election) below to
32 # &quot;Q&quot; (Quadrennial) to maintain three-character zone abbreviations.
33 # If you&#39;re really conservative, you might want to change it to &quot;D&quot;.
34 # Avoid &quot;L&quot; (Leap Year), which won&#39;t be true in 2100.
35 
36 # If Presidential Election Time is ever established, replace &quot;XXXX&quot; below
37 # with the year the law takes effect and uncomment the &quot;##&quot; lines.
