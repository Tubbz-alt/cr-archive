<span class="line-modified"> 2 This directory contains the source and the binary version of a Windows </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 3 utility to remove all non-owner Access Control Entries from a given file.</span>

 5 The tool is used by regression tests in the following directories :-
 6 
 7 test/sun/management/jmxremote/bootstrap
 8 
 9 The tests in these directories create password or ACL files that need to
10 be &quot;secured&quot; (meaning that only the owner should have access to the 
11 files). 
12 
<span class="line-removed">13 Both the source and the binary version are checked into SCCS. If</span>
<span class="line-removed">14 you require to make changes to the tool then you need to Visual</span>
<span class="line-removed">15 C++ to rebuild revokeall.exe after changing the source.</span>
<span class="line-removed">16 </span>
<span class="line-removed">17 To rebuild the tool you need to setup your environment (by</span>
<span class="line-removed">18 calling the VC++ VCVARS32.BAT script), and then executing the </span>
<span class="line-removed">19 following command :-</span>
<span class="line-removed">20 </span>
<span class="line-removed">21 cl /mt revokeall.c advapi32.lib</span>
<span class="line-removed">22 </span>
<span class="line-removed">23 This will generate revokeall.exe.</span>
<span class="line-removed">24 </span>
<span class="line-removed">25 Note that a 32-bit version of revokeall.exe is checked into SCCS</span>
<span class="line-removed">26 - this 32-bit application is also used when running on 64-bit</span>
<span class="line-removed">27 versions of Windows (AMD64 and IA64).</span>
