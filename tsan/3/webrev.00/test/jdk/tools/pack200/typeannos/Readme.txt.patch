-This directory contains tests which exercises all possible TypeAnnotations
-structure. These tests are borrowed from 
-langtools/test/tools.javac/annotations/typeAnnotations.

-The reason it is copied over is that we need to test pack200 and these 
-annotation may not be present in any of the JDK/JRE jars, yet we need to test
-all these cases.

-Therefore it would be a good practice to sync these tests with the  original
-if there are any changes.
