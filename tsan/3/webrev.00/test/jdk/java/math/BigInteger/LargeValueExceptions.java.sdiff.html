 38 // the largest values which should not overflow and the smallest values which
 39 // should. The transition values used are not necessarily at the exact
 40 // boundaries but should be &quot;close.&quot; Quite a few different values were used
 41 // experimentally before settling on the ones in this test. For multiplication
 42 // and squaring all cases are exercised: definite overflow and non-overflow
 43 // which can be detected &quot;up front,&quot; and &quot;indefinite&quot; overflow, i.e., overflow
 44 // which cannot be detected up front so further calculations are required.
 45 //
 46 // Testing negative values is unnecessary. For both multiplication and squaring
 47 // the paths lead to the Toom-Cook algorithm where the signum is used only to
 48 // determine the sign of the result and not in the intermediate calculations.
