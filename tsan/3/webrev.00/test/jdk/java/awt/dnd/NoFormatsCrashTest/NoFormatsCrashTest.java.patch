-// Note there is no @ in front of test above.  This is so that the
-//  harness will not mistake this file as a test file.  It should
-//  only see the html file as a test file. (the harness runs all
-//  valid test files, so it would run this test twice if this file
-//  were valid as well as the html file.)
-// Also, note the area= after Your Name in the author tag.  Here, you
-//  should put which functional area the test falls in.  See the
-//  AWT-core home page -> test areas and/or -> AWT team  for a list of
-//  areas.
-// Note also the 'NoFormatsCrashTest.html' in the run tag.  This should
-//  be changed to the name of the test.

-//Automated tests should run as applet tests if possible because they
-// get their environments cleaned up, including AWT threads, any
-// test created threads, and any system resources used by the test
-// such as file descriptors.  (This is normally not a problem as
-// main tests usually run in a separate VM, however on some platforms
-// such as the Mac, separate VMs are not possible and non-applet
-// tests will cause problems).  Also, you don't have to worry about
-// synchronisation stuff in Applet tests they way you do in main
-// tests...
