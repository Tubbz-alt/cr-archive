-// Note there is no @ in front of test above.  This is so that the
-//  harness will not mistake this file as a test file.  It should
-//  only see the html file as a test file. (the harness runs all
-//  valid test files, so it would run this test twice if this file
-//  were valid as well as the html file.)
-// Also, note the area= after Your Name in the author tag.  Here, you
-//  should put which functional area the test falls in.  See the
-//  AWT-core home page -> test areas and/or -> AWT team  for a list of
-//  areas.
-// Note also the 'DisposeStressTest.html' in the run tag.  This should
-//  be changed to the name of the test.
