 34 // Note there is no @ in front of test above.  This is so that the
 35 //  harness will not mistake this file as a test file.  It should
 36 //  only see the html file as a test file. (the harness runs all
 37 //  valid test files, so it would run this test twice if this file
 38 //  were valid as well as the html file.)
 39 // Also, note the area= after Your Name in the author tag.  Here, you
 40 //  should put which functional area the test falls in.  See the
 41 //  AWT-core home page -&gt; test areas and/or -&gt; AWT team  for a list of
 42 //  areas.
 43 // Note also the &#39;DisposeStressTest.html&#39; in the run tag.  This should
 44 //  be changed to the name of the test.
