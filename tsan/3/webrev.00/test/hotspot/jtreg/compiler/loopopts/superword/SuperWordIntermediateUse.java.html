44          * Before unrolling this loop:
45          * iFld:   AddI 1 = -85 + Phi 1
46          * local:  MulI 2 = Phi 1 * LoadI 3
47          *
48          * This loop is now unrolled. &#39;local&#39; is a reduction. The loop is first copied:
49          * iFldCopy:  AddI C1 = -85 + Phi C1
50          * localCopy: MulI C2 = Phi C1 * LoadI C3
51          *
52          * iFld:   AddI 1 = -85 + Phi 1
53          * local:  MulI 2 = Phi 1 * LoadI 3
54          *
55          * Then, the unnecessary nodes like phis are removed from the original loop by igvn:
56          * (iFldCopy:  AddI C1 = -85 + Phi C1) field store optimized away
57          * localCopy: MulI C2 = Phi C1 * LoadI C3
58          *
59          * iFld:   AddI 1 = -85 + MulI C2
60          * local:  MulI 2 = MulI C2 * LoadI 3 -&gt; Input into Phi C1
61          *
62          *  As a result AddI 1 has an input from MulI C2 which isn&#39;t the last operation in the reduction chain
63          *  Phi C1 -&gt; MulI C2 -&gt; MulI 2 -&gt; Phi C1 and therefore not the last element in a pack.
64          *  Additionally, AddI 1 does not belong to the loop being optimized: The store node for iFld is put outside of the loop being optimized.
65          *  This triggers the assertion bug when unrolled at least 4 times which creates packs of at least size 4.
