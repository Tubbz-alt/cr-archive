45          * The array field store in the Wrapper object &#39;wrapper.arr = arr&#39; cannot be capturued due to an early bail out.
46          * Therefore, the initial value of wrapper.arr is null.
47          * As a result, the escape analysis marks the array allocation as not scalar replaceable:
48          * &#39;wrapper.arr&#39; which is null is merged with the int array object in the assignment &#39;wrapper.arr = arr&#39;.
49          * Both null and the int array are treated as different objects. As a result the array allocation cannot be eliminated.
50          *
51          * The new enhancement does not bail out early anymore and therefore escape analysis does not mark it as
52          * not scalar replaceable. This results in elimination of all allocations in this method.
