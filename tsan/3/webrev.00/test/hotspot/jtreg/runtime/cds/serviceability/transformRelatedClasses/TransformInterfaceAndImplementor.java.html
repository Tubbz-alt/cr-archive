37 // CDS is not supported w/o the use of Compressed OOPs
38 // JVMTI&#39;s ClassFileLoadHook is not supported under minimal VM

40 // This test class uses TransformRelatedClasses to do its work.
41 // The goal of this test is to exercise transformation of related interface
42 // and its implementor in combination with CDS.
43 // The transformation is done via ClassFileLoadHook mechanism.
44 // Both superclass and subclass reside in the shared archive.
45 // The test consists of 4 test cases where transformation is applied
46 // to an interface and an implementor in a combinatorial manner.
47 // Please see TransformRelatedClasses.java for details.
