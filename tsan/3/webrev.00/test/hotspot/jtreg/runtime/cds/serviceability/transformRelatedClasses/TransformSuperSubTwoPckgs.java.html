39 // CDS is not supported w/o the use of Compressed OOPs
40 // JVMTI&#39;s ClassFileLoadHook is not supported under minimal VM

42 // This test class uses TransformRelatedClasses to do its work.
43 // The goal of this test is to exercise transformation of related superclass
44 // and subclass in combination with CDS; each class lives in its own package.
45 // The transformation is done via ClassFileLoadHook mechanism.
46 // Both superclass and subclass reside in the shared archive.
47 // The test consists of 4 test cases where transformation is applied
48 // to a parent and child in combinatorial manner.
49 // Please see TransformRelatedClasses.java for details.
