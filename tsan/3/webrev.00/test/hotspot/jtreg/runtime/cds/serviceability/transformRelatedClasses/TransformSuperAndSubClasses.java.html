38 // CDS is not supported w/o the use of Compressed OOPs

41 // This test class uses TransformRelatedClasses to do its work.
42 // The goal of this test is to exercise transformation of related superclass
43 // and subclass in combination with CDS.
44 // The transformation is done via ClassFileLoadHook mechanism.
45 // Both superclass and subclass reside in the shared archive.
46 // The test consists of 4 test cases where transformation is applied
47 // to a parent and child in combinatorial manner.
48 // Please see TransformRelatedClasses.java for details.
