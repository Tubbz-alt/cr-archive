 50          * let five subsequent error reporting steps hang. The Timeout handling triggered
 51          * by the WatcherThread should kick in and interrupt those steps. In theory, the
 52          * text &quot;timeout occurred during error reporting in step ..&quot; (the little timeouts)
 53          * should occur in the error log up to four times, followed by the final big timeout
 54          * &quot;------ Timeout during error reporting after xx s. ------&quot;
 55          *
 56          * Note that there are a number of uncertainties which make writing a 100% foolproof
 57          * test challenging. The time the error reporting thread takes to react to the
 58          * timeout triggers is unknown. So it is difficult to predict how many little timeouts
 59          * will be visible before the big timeout kicks in. Also, once the big timeout hits,
 60          * error reporting thread and Watcherthread will race. The former writes his last
 61          * message to the error logs and flushes, the latter waits 200ms and then exits the
 62          * process without further synchronization with the error reporting thread.
 63          *
 64          * Because of all this and the desire to write a bullet proof test which does
 65          * not fail sporadically, we will not test for the final timeout message nor for all
 66          * of the optimally expected little timeout messages. We just test for two of the
 67          * little timeout messages to see that repeated timeout handling is basically working.
