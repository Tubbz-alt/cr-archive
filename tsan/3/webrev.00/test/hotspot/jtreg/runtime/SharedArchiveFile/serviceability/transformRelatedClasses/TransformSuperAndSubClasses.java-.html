41 // Clarification on @requires declarations:
42 // CDS is not supported w/o the use of Compressed OOPs
43 // JVMTI&#39;s ClassFileLoadHook is not supported under minimal VM
44 
45 // This test class uses TransformRelatedClasses to do its work.
46 // The goal of this test is to exercise transformation of related superclass
47 // and subclass in combination with CDS.
48 // The transformation is done via ClassFileLoadHook mechanism.
49 // Both superclass and subclass reside in the shared archive.
50 // The test consists of 4 test cases where transformation is applied
51 // to a parent and child in combinatorial manner.
52 // Please see TransformRelatedClasses.java for details.
