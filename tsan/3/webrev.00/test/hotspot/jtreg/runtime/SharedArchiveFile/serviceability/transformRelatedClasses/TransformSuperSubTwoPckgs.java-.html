42 // Clarification on @requires declarations:
43 // CDS is not supported w/o the use of Compressed OOPs
44 // JVMTI&#39;s ClassFileLoadHook is not supported under minimal VM
45 
46 // This test class uses TransformRelatedClasses to do its work.
47 // The goal of this test is to exercise transformation of related superclass
48 // and subclass in combination with CDS; each class lives in its own package.
49 // The transformation is done via ClassFileLoadHook mechanism.
50 // Both superclass and subclass reside in the shared archive.
51 // The test consists of 4 test cases where transformation is applied
52 // to a parent and child in combinatorial manner.
53 // Please see TransformRelatedClasses.java for details.
