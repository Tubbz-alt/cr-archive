31  * DESCRIPTION
32  *     The test is for TC05 and TC06 scenarios of &quot;thread contention profiling&quot;.
33  *     The test sets callbacks for MonitorWait and MonitorWaited events and
34  *     lets thread T to wait in monitor M for 1 millisec then checks that
35  *     time frame between the events calculated via GetTime is equal or greater
36  *     than 1 millisec if waiting of T was timed out (TC05).
37  *     The test also checks that time frame returned by GetThreadCpuTime
38  *     for T between the events is less than 1 millisec if waiting
39  *     of T was timed out (TC06).
