23 
<span class="line-modified">24     Tests getThreadAllocatedBytes(long id) and  getThreadAllocatedBytes(long[] ids),</span>

25     functions of com.sun.management.ThreadMXBean
26 
27     All methods should
28     - return -1 if ThreadCpuTime allocation is not enabled
29     - return -1 for not started thread
30     - return &gt; 0 value for any running thread
31     - return -1 for finished thread
32 
33     Test is executed in following configurations:
34     ThreadMXBean is accessed
35       - directly threw ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean()
36       - threw default MBeanServer
37       - threw custom MBeanServer
38       - threw default Proxy
39       - threw custom Proxy
