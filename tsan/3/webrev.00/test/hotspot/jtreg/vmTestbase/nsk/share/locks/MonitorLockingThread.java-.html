 41      *   Class MonitorLockingThread is written for usage in tests provoking monitor contention.
 42      *   Typically in these tests exists thread holding lock (MonitorLockingThread) and another
 43      *   thread trying to acquire the same lock. But this scenario also requires one more thread
 44      *   which will force MonitorLockingThread to release lock when contention occurred, for this purpose
 45      *   auxiliary thread class LockFreeThread is written.
 46      *
 47      *   Example of usage of MonitorLockingThread and LockFreeThread:
 48      *
 49      *   Object lock = new Object();
 50      *   MonitorLockingThread monitorLockingThread = new MonitorLockingThread(lock);
 51      *
 52      *   MonitorLockingThread.LockFreeThread lockFreeThread =
 53      *       new MonitorLockingThread.LockFreeThread(Thread.currentThread(), monitorLockingThread);
 54      *
 55      *   monitorLockingThread.acquireLock();
 56      *
 57      *   lockFreeThread.start();
 58      *
 59      *   // try to acquire lock which is already held by MonitorLockingThread (here monitor contention should occur),
 60      *   // when LockFreeThread finds that contention occurred it forces MonitorLockingThread to release lock
 61      *   // and current thread is able to continue execution
 62      *   synchronized (lock) {
