 84 Naming conventions
 85 
 86 Classes:
 87 
 88     All shared classes are groupped into packages to prevent
 89     name collision.
 90 
 91     All classes exported directly from this directory are
 92     of package:
 93 
 94         nsk.share
 95 
 96     All classes exported from subdirectories are of particular
 97     subpackage, e.g.:
 98 
 99         nsk.share.jpda
100         nsk.share.jdwp
101         nsk.share.jdi
102         nsk.share.jdb
103         nsk.share.sysdict
104 
105 Native functions and macroses:
106 
107     Most native functions have special prefix to prevent linking collisions.
108     Most macroses also have special prefix and are wrote in upper register.
109 
110     Here is typical naming scheme used for native functions and macroses:
111 
112         share/native
113             functions: nsk_*
114             macroses:  NSK_*
115 
116         share/jni
117             functions: nsk_jni_*
118             macroses:  NSK_JNI_*
119 
120         share/jvmti
121             functions: nsk_jvmti_*
122             macroses:  NSK_JVMTI_*
123 
124     However, some native functions and macroses do not follow this scheme,
125     in order to preserve compatibility with old tests.
