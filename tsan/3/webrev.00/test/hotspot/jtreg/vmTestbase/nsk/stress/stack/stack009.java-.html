29  * VM testbase keywords: [stress, quick, stack, nonconcurrent]

31  * DESCRIPTION
32  *     The test provokes second stack overflow from within the
33  *     stack overflow handler.
34  *     This test measures a number of recursive invocations until
35  *     StackOverflowError, and then tries to make an invocation
36  *     for the fixed invocations depth from within the &quot;catch&quot;
37  *     block just caught the 1st stack overflow. The depth of new
38  *     invocations is 10 times that depth seen at the 1st stack
39  *     overflow; so that another stack overflow occurs.
40  *     The test is deemed passed, if VM have not crashed, and
41  *     if there is no exception thrown other than due to stack
42  *     overflow.
43  * COMMENTS
44  *     This test crashes HS versions 2.0, 1.3, and 1.4 on Win32
45  *     and Solaris platforms.
46  *     See the bug:
47  *     4366625 (P4/S4) multiple stack overflow causes HS crash
48  *
49  * @requires vm.opt.DeoptimizeALot != true
