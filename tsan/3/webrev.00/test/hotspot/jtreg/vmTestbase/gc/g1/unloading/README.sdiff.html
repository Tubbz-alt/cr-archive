 53           &quot;anonymous_classloader&quot;.
 54   - classloaders that we expect to live can be referenced in several ways.
 55       This behavior can be adjusted with flag &quot;-keepRefMode&quot; that has valid options:
 56 	  &quot;strong_reference&quot; for starighforward keeping strong reference,
 57 	  &quot;static_field&quot; for keeping reference in static field of alive class,
 58 	  &quot;stack_local&quot; for keeping reference in local variable of running thread,
 59 	  &quot;thread_field&quot; for keeping reference in field of running thread&#39;s object,
 60 	  &quot;thread_itself&quot; if we want object to be a running thread itself,
 61 	  &quot;static_field_of_root_class&quot;. In this case reference will be kept in static field of class that wa
 62 s loaded by null classloader.
 63 	  &quot;jni_global_ref&quot;. In this case global reference will be kept in native library.
 64 	  &quot;jni_local_ref&quot;, In this case local reference will be kept in JNI call in running thread.
 65   - Another aspect is that class can be humongous.
 66       Humongous classes can be enabled with &quot;-humongousClass&quot; command line option. Valid options are
 67 &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;.
 68   - Another aspect that is covered with tests is that class methods can be compiled by JIT compiler.
 69       This behavior can be adjusted with &quot;-compilationLevel&quot; and &quot;-compilationNumber&quot; options. First
 70 one has self-explaining name, latter sets number of optimization/deoptimozation of each class.
 71   - Next aspect is class redefinition.
<span class="line-modified"> 72       You can enable classes redefinition with &quot;-redefineClasses&quot; flag.</span>

 73 
 74 Test implementation details:
 75   Test supposed to be ran with G1 gc and -XX:+ExplicitGCProvokesConcurrent option. In the end of exec
 76 ution test checks if full gc happened. If this is the case the test throws descriptive exception and
 77 fails.
 78 
 79 Test guts design:
 80   Test in loop performs the following until time is over (timelimit is set up with &quot;-stressTime&quot; opti
 81 on):
 82 	- loads class that gonna live or gonna be unloaded. Decision depends upon Random.nextBoolean().
 83 	- previous action produces collection of Assertions (what assertion is is explained a little bit lat
 84 er). Assertions are saved into AssertionContainer.
 85 	- takes from AssertionContainer assertions that are already mature for check and performs checks. &quot;M
 86 ature&quot; means that required number of System.gc() calls happened since assertion was created.
 87 
 88 What &quot;Assertion&quot; is:
 89  Assertion incapsulates check that concrete class will be alive or dead. Hazard is that we can&#39;t perf
 90 orm check just after we removed last reference to classloader. We have to wait some number of concurr
 91 ent-mark-cycles, i.e. System.gc() calls. For this reason we put each assertion in AssertionContainer
 92 and get back much later, when it&#39;s ready for check.
