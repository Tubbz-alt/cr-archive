26 The tests are divided by scenario.
27 
28 Each scenario has the problem it tries to solve, and it does that with several options:
29   - BulkBench only compares handmade solutions vs. JDK bulk operations, without resorting to lambdas/methodrefs
30   - LambdaBench does bulk operations with lambdas/methodrefs
31   - XtrasBench has some other interesting options
32 
33 All tests in these benchmarks follow the following naming convention.
34 Test names is the concatenation of several markers:
35 
36 {hm|bulk}: infrastructure used
37   - hm: &quot;handmade&quot; version which users would presumably implement otherwise
38   - bulk: JDK8-ish bulk operation
39 
40 {seq|par}: parallelism mode
41   - seq: sequential mode
42   - par: parallel mode; in &quot;hm&quot; case, this might have different implementations
43 
44 {.|inner|lambda|mref}: functional interface type
45   - .: no specific meaning
46   - inner: explicit inner class
47   - lambda: JDK8-ish lambda
48   - mref: JDK8-ish method ref
49 
50 E.g. bulk_seq_inner is the test harnesses JDK8 bulk operations in sequential mode, and explicit inner class as function
51 
52 All benchmarks should be executed in the following modes (see -t harness cmdline option):
53  - single mode (thread = 1),
54  - core mode   (thread = number of cores),
55  - max mode    (thread = number of HW threads).
