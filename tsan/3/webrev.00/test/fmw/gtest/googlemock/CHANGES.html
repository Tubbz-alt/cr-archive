  1 Changes for 1.7.0:
  2 
  3 * All new improvements in Google Test 1.7.0.
  4 * New feature: matchers DoubleNear(), FloatNear(),
  5   NanSensitiveDoubleNear(), NanSensitiveFloatNear(),
  6   UnorderedElementsAre(), UnorderedElementsAreArray(), WhenSorted(),
  7   WhenSortedBy(), IsEmpty(), and SizeIs().
  8 * Improvement: Google Mock can now be built as a DLL.
  9 * Improvement: when compiled by a C++11 compiler, matchers AllOf()
 10   and AnyOf() can accept an arbitrary number of matchers.
 11 * Improvement: when compiled by a C++11 compiler, matchers
 12   ElementsAreArray() can accept an initializer list.
 13 * Improvement: when exceptions are enabled, a mock method with no
 14   default action now throws instead crashing the test.
 15 * Improvement: added class testing::StringMatchResultListener to aid
 16   definition of composite matchers.
 17 * Improvement: function return types used in MOCK_METHOD*() macros can
 18   now contain unprotected commas.
 19 * Improvement (potentially breaking): EXPECT_THAT() and ASSERT_THAT()
 20   are now more strict in ensuring that the value type and the matcher
 21   type are compatible, catching potential bugs in tests.
 22 * Improvement: Pointee() now works on an optional&lt;T&gt;.
 23 * Improvement: the ElementsAreArray() matcher can now take a vector or
 24   iterator range as input, and makes a copy of its input elements
 25   before the conversion to a Matcher.
 26 * Improvement: the Google Mock Generator can now generate mocks for
 27   some class templates.
 28 * Bug fix: mock object destruction triggerred by another mock object&#39;s
 29   destruction no longer hangs.
 30 * Improvement: Google Mock Doctor works better with newer Clang and
 31   GCC now.
 32 * Compatibility fixes.
 33 * Bug/warning fixes.
 34 
 35 Changes for 1.6.0:
 36 
 37 * Compilation is much faster and uses much less memory, especially
 38   when the constructor and destructor of a mock class are moved out of
 39   the class body.
 40 * New matchers: Pointwise(), Each().
 41 * New actions: ReturnPointee() and ReturnRefOfCopy().
 42 * CMake support.
 43 * Project files for Visual Studio 2010.
 44 * AllOf() and AnyOf() can handle up-to 10 arguments now.
 45 * Google Mock doctor understands Clang error messages now.
 46 * SetArgPointee&lt;&gt; now accepts string literals.
 47 * gmock_gen.py handles storage specifier macros and template return
 48   types now.
 49 * Compatibility fixes.
 50 * Bug fixes and implementation clean-ups.
 51 * Potentially incompatible changes: disables the harmful &#39;make install&#39;
 52   command in autotools.
 53 
 54 Potentially breaking changes:
 55 
 56 * The description string for MATCHER*() changes from Python-style
 57   interpolation to an ordinary C++ string expression.
 58 * SetArgumentPointee is deprecated in favor of SetArgPointee.
 59 * Some non-essential project files for Visual Studio 2005 are removed.
 60 
 61 Changes for 1.5.0:
 62 
 63  * New feature: Google Mock can be safely used in multi-threaded tests
 64    on platforms having pthreads.
 65  * New feature: function for printing a value of arbitrary type.
 66  * New feature: function ExplainMatchResult() for easy definition of
 67    composite matchers.
 68  * The new matcher API lets user-defined matchers generate custom
 69    explanations more directly and efficiently.
 70  * Better failure messages all around.
 71  * NotNull() and IsNull() now work with smart pointers.
 72  * Field() and Property() now work when the matcher argument is a pointer
 73    passed by reference.
 74  * Regular expression matchers on all platforms.
 75  * Added GCC 4.0 support for Google Mock Doctor.
 76  * Added gmock_all_test.cc for compiling most Google Mock tests
 77    in a single file.
 78  * Significantly cleaned up compiler warnings.
 79  * Bug fixes, better test coverage, and implementation clean-ups.
 80 
 81  Potentially breaking changes:
 82 
 83  * Custom matchers defined using MatcherInterface or MakePolymorphicMatcher()
 84    need to be updated after upgrading to Google Mock 1.5.0; matchers defined
 85    using MATCHER or MATCHER_P* aren&#39;t affected.
 86  * Dropped support for &#39;make install&#39;.
 87 
 88 Changes for 1.4.0 (we skipped 1.2.* and 1.3.* to match the version of
 89 Google Test):
 90 
 91  * Works in more environments: Symbian and minGW, Visual C++ 7.1.
 92  * Lighter weight: comes with our own implementation of TR1 tuple (no
 93    more dependency on Boost!).
 94  * New feature: --gmock_catch_leaked_mocks for detecting leaked mocks.
 95  * New feature: ACTION_TEMPLATE for defining templatized actions.
 96  * New feature: the .After() clause for specifying expectation order.
 97  * New feature: the .With() clause for specifying inter-argument
 98    constraints.
 99  * New feature: actions ReturnArg&lt;k&gt;(), ReturnNew&lt;T&gt;(...), and
100    DeleteArg&lt;k&gt;().
101  * New feature: matchers Key(), Pair(), Args&lt;...&gt;(), AllArgs(), IsNull(),
102    and Contains().
103  * New feature: utility class MockFunction&lt;F&gt;, useful for checkpoints, etc.
104  * New feature: functions Value(x, m) and SafeMatcherCast&lt;T&gt;(m).
105  * New feature: copying a mock object is rejected at compile time.
106  * New feature: a script for fusing all Google Mock and Google Test
107    source files for easy deployment.
108  * Improved the Google Mock doctor to diagnose more diseases.
109  * Improved the Google Mock generator script.
110  * Compatibility fixes for Mac OS X and gcc.
111  * Bug fixes and implementation clean-ups.
112 
113 Changes for 1.1.0:
114 
115  * New feature: ability to use Google Mock with any testing framework.
116  * New feature: macros for easily defining new matchers
117  * New feature: macros for easily defining new actions.
118  * New feature: more container matchers.
119  * New feature: actions for accessing function arguments and throwing
120    exceptions.
121  * Improved the Google Mock doctor script for diagnosing compiler errors.
122  * Bug fixes and implementation clean-ups.
123 
124 Changes for 1.0.0:
125 
126  * Initial Open Source release of Google Mock
