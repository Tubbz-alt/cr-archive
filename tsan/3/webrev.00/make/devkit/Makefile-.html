 27 #
 28 # This Makefile, together with Tools.gmk, can be used to compile a set of
 29 # gcc based cross compilation, portable, self contained packages, capable
 30 # of building OpenJDK.
 31 #
 32 # In addition to the makefiles, access to Oracle Linux installation
 33 # media is required. This has been tested against Oracle Enterprise Linux
 34 # 6.4.
 35 #
 36 # By default this Makefile will build a native toolchain for the current
 37 # platform if called with something like this:
 38 #
 39 # make tars BASE_OS=OEL6
 40 #
 41 # To build the full set of crosstools for additional platforms, use a command
 42 # line looking like this:
 43 #
 44 # make TARGETS=&quot;aarch64-linux-gnu&quot; BASE_OS=Fedora
 45 # or
 46 # make TARGETS=&quot;arm-linux-gnueabihf ppc64-linux-gnu&quot; BASE_OS=Fedora BASE_OS_VERSION=17
 47 #
 48 # to build several devkits for a specific OS version at once.
 49 # You can find the final results under ../../build/devkit/result/&lt;host&gt;-to-&lt;target&gt;
 50 #
 51 # This is the makefile which iterates over all host and target platforms.
