  36 # Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
  37 # Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
  38 # San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
  39 # Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
  40 #
  41 # Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
  42 # for time zone data was the International Air Transport
  43 # Association&#39;s Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
  44 # published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
  45 # of the IATA&#39;s data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
  46 # IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
  47 #
  48 # Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
  49 # Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
  50 # I found in the UCLA library.
  51 #
  52 # For data circa 1899, a common source is:
  53 # Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899 Feb;13(2):173-94.
  54 # https://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359

  56 # For Russian data circa 1919, a source is:
  57 # Byalokoz EL. New Counting of Time in Russia since July 1, 1919.
  58 # (See the &#39;europe&#39; file for a fuller citation.)

 119 # readopting Russian DST in 1997.  Go with Shanks &amp; Pottenger, even
 120 # when they disagree with others.  Edgar Der-Danieliantz
 121 # reported (1996-05-04) that Yerevan probably wouldn&#39;t use DST

 389 # From Anthony Fok (2001-12-20):
 390 # BTW, I did some research on-line and found some info regarding these five
 391 # historic timezones from some Taiwan websites.  And yes, there are official
 392 # Chinese names for these locales (before 1949).
 393 #
 394 # From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2006-07-14):
 395 # I have investigated the timezones around 1970 on the
 396 # https://www.astro.com/atlas site [with provinces and county
 397 # boundaries summarized below]....  A few other exceptions were two
 398 # counties on the Sichuan side of the Xizang-Sichuan border,
 399 # counties Dege and Baiyu which lies on the Sichuan side and are
 400 # therefore supposed to be GMT+7, Xizang region being GMT+6, but Dege
 401 # county is GMT+8 according to astro.com while Baiyu county is GMT+6
 402 # (could be true), for the moment I am assuming that those two
 403 # counties are mistakes in the astro.com data.

 414 # It gives evidence that at the beginning of the PRC, Beijing time was
 415 # officially apparent solar time!  However, Guo also says that the
 416 # evidence is dubious, as the relevant institute of astronomy had not
 417 # been taken over by the PRC yet.  It&#39;s plausible that apparent solar
 418 # time was announced but never implemented, and that people continued
 419 # to use UT+8.  As the Shanghai radio station (and I presume the
 420 # observatory) was still under control of French missionaries, it
 421 # could well have ignored any such mandate.
 422 #

 424 # Guo Qing-sheng (Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory, CAS, Xi&#39;an 710600, China)
 425 # A Study on the Standard Time Changes for the Past 100 Years in China
 426 # [undated and unknown publication location]
 427 # It says several things:
 428 #   * The Qing dynasty used local apparent solar time throughout China.
 429 #   * The Republic of China instituted Beijing mean solar time effective
 430 #     the official calendar book of 1914.
 431 #   * The French Concession in Shanghai set up signal stations in
 432 #     French docks in the 1890s, controlled by Xujiahui (Zikawei)
 433 #     Observatory and set to local mean time.
 434 #   * &quot;From the end of the 19th century&quot; it changed to UT+8.
 435 #   * Chinese Customs (by then reduced to a tool of foreign powers)
 436 #     eventually standardized on this time for all ports, and it
 437 #     became used by railways as well.
 438 #   * In 1918 the Central Observatory proposed dividing China into
 439 #     five time zones (see below for details).  This caught on
 440 #     at first only in coastal areas observing UT+8.
 441 #   * During WWII all of China was in theory was at UT+7.  In practice
 442 #     this was ignored in the west, and I presume was ignored in
 443 #     Japanese-occupied territory.
 444 #   * Japanese-occupied Manchuria was at UT+9, i.e., Japan time.
 445 #   * The five-zone plan was resurrected after WWII and officially put into
 446 #     place (with some modifications) in March 1948.  It&#39;s not clear
 447 #     how well it was observed in areas under Nationalist control.
 448 #   * The People&#39;s Liberation Army used UT+8 during the civil war.
 449 #
 450 # An AP article &quot;Shanghai Internat&#39;l Area Little Changed&quot; in the
 451 # Lewiston (ME) Daily Sun (1939-05-29), p 17, said &quot;Even the time is
 452 # different - the occupied districts going by Tokyo time, an hour
 453 # ahead of that prevailing in the rest of Shanghai.&quot;  Guess that the
 454 # Xujiahui Observatory was under French control and stuck with UT +08.
 455 #
 456 # In earlier versions of this file, China had many separate Zone entries, but
 457 # this was based on what were apparently incorrect data in Shanks &amp; Pottenger.
 458 # This has now been simplified to the two entries Asia/Shanghai and
 459 # Asia/Urumqi, with the others being links for backward compatibility.
 460 # Proposed in 1918 and theoretically in effect until 1949 (although in practice
 461 # mainly observed in coastal areas), the five zones were:
 462 #
 463 # Changbai Time (&quot;Long-white Time&quot;, Long-white = Heilongjiang area) UT +08:30
 464 # Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here.
 465 # Heilongjiang (except Mohe county), Jilin
 466 #
 467 # Zhongyuan Time (&quot;Central plain Time&quot;) UT +08
 468 # Now part of Asia/Shanghai.
 469 # most of China
 470 # Milne gives 8:05:43.2 for Xujiahui Observatory time; round to nearest.
 471 # Guo says Shanghai switched to UT +08 &quot;from the end of the 19th century&quot;.
 472 #
 473 # Long-shu Time (probably as Long and Shu were two names of the area) UT +07
 474 # Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here.
 475 # Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Ningxia, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Yunnan;
 476 # most of Gansu; west Inner Mongolia; east Qinghai; and the Guangdong
 477 # counties Deqing, Enping, Kaiping, Luoding, Taishan, Xinxing,
 478 # Yangchun, Yangjiang, Yu&#39;nan, and Yunfu.
 479 #
 480 # Xin-zang Time (&quot;Xinjiang-Tibet Time&quot;) UT +06
 481 # This region is now part of either Asia/Urumqi or Asia/Shanghai with

 499 
 500 # From Luther Ma (2009-10-17):
 501 # Almost all (&gt;99.9%) ethnic Chinese (properly ethnic Han) living in
 502 # Xinjiang use Chinese Standard Time. Some are aware of Xinjiang time,
 503 # but have no need of it. All planes, trains, and schools function on
 504 # what is called &quot;Beijing time.&quot; When Han make an appointment in Chinese
 505 # they implicitly use Beijing time.
 506 #
 507 # On the other hand, ethnic Uyghurs, who make up about half the
 508 # population of Xinjiang, typically use &quot;Xinjiang time&quot; which is two
 509 # hours behind Beijing time, or UT +06. The government of the Xinjiang
 510 # Uyghur Autonomous Region, (XAUR, or just Xinjiang for short) as well as
 511 # local governments such as the Ürümqi city government use both times in
 512 # publications, referring to what is popularly called Xinjiang time as
 513 # &quot;Ürümqi time.&quot; When Uyghurs make an appointment in the Uyghur language
 514 # they almost invariably use Xinjiang time.
 515 #
 516 # (Their ethnic Han compatriots would typically have no clue of its
 517 # widespread use, however, because so extremely few of them are fluent in
 518 # Uyghur, comparable to the number of Anglo-Americans fluent in Navajo.)
 519 #
 520 # (...As with the rest of China there was a brief interval ending in 1990
 521 # or 1991 when summer time was in use.  The confusion was severe, with
 522 # the province not having dual times but four times in use at the same
 523 # time. Some areas remained on standard Xinjiang time or Beijing time and
 524 # others moving their clocks ahead.)
 525 
 526 # From Luther Ma (2009-11-19):
 527 # With the risk of being redundant to previous answers these are the most common
 528 # English &quot;transliterations&quot; (w/o using non-English symbols):
 529 #
 530 # 1. Wulumuqi...
 531 # 2. Kashi...
 532 # 3. Urumqi...
 533 # 4. Kashgar...
 534 # ...
 535 # 5. It seems that Uyghurs in Ürümqi has been using Xinjiang since at least the
 536 # 1960&#39;s. I know of one Han, now over 50, who grew up in the surrounding
 537 # countryside and used Xinjiang time as a child.
 538 #
 539 # 6. Likewise for Kashgar and the rest of south Xinjiang I don&#39;t know of any
 540 # start date for Xinjiang time.
 541 #
 542 # Without having access to local historical records, nor the ability to legally
 543 # publish them, I would go with October 1, 1949, when Xinjiang became the Uyghur
 544 # Autonomous Region under the PRC. (Before that Uyghurs, of course, would also
 545 # not be using Beijing time, but some local time.)
 546 
 547 # From David Cochrane (2014-03-26):
 548 # Just a confirmation that Ürümqi time was implemented in Ürümqi on 1 Feb 1986:
 549 # https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960684,00.html
 550 
 551 # From Luther Ma (2014-04-22):
 552 # I have interviewed numerous people of various nationalities and from
 553 # different localities in Xinjiang and can confirm the information in Guo&#39;s
 554 # report regarding Xinjiang, as well as the Time article reference by David
 555 # Cochrane.  Whether officially recognized or not (and both are officially
 556 # recognized), two separate times have been in use in Xinjiang since at least
 557 # the Cultural Revolution: Xinjiang Time (XJT), aka Ürümqi Time or local time;
 558 # and Beijing Time.  There is no confusion in Xinjiang as to which name refers
 559 # to which time. Both are widely used in the province, although in some
 560 # population groups might be use one to the exclusion of the other.  The only
 561 # problem is that computers and smart phones list Ürümqi (or Kashgar) as
 562 # having the same time as Beijing.
 563 
 564 # From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 565 # In the early days of the PRC, Tibet was given its own time zone (UT +06)
 566 # but this was withdrawn in 1959 and never reinstated; see Tubten Khétsun,
 567 # Memories of life in Lhasa under Chinese Rule, Columbia U Press, ISBN
 568 # 978-0231142861 (2008), translator&#39;s introduction by Matthew Akester, p x.
 569 # As this is before our 1970 cutoff, Tibet doesn&#39;t need a separate zone.
 570 #
 571 # Xinjiang Time is well-documented as being officially recognized.  E.g., see
 572 # &quot;The Working-Calendar for The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government&quot;
 573 # &lt;http://www.sinkiang.gov.cn/service/ourworking/&gt; (2014-04-22).
 574 # Unfortunately, we have no good records of time in Xinjiang before 1986.
 575 # During the 20th century parts of Xinjiang were ruled by the Qing dynasty,
 576 # the Republic of China, various warlords, the First and Second East Turkestan
 577 # Republics, the Soviet Union, the Kuomintang, and the People&#39;s Republic of
 578 # China, and tracking down all these organizations&#39; timekeeping rules would be
 579 # quite a trick.  Approximate this lost history by a transition from LMT to
 580 # UT +06 at the start of 1928, the year of accession of the warlord Jin Shuren,
 581 # which happens to be the date given by Shanks &amp; Pottenger (no doubt as a
 582 # guess) as the transition from LMT.  Ignore the usage of +08 before
 583 # 1986-02-01 under the theory that the transition date to +08 is unknown and
 584 # that the sort of users who prefer Asia/Urumqi now typically ignored the
 585 # +08 mandate back then.

 694 # From smallufo (2010-04-03):
 695 # According to Taiwan&#39;s CWB [Central Weather Bureau],
 696 # http://www.cwb.gov.tw/V6/astronomy/cdata/summert.htm
 697 # Taipei has DST in 1979 between July 1st and Sep 30.
 698 
 699 # From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2013-07-12):
 700 # On Dec 28, 1895, the Meiji Emperor announced Ordinance No. 167 of
 701 # Meiji Year 28 &quot;The clause about standard time&quot;, mentioned that
 702 # Taiwan and Penghu Islands, as well as Yaeyama and Miyako Islands
 703 # (both in Okinawa) adopt the Western Standard Time which is based on
 704 # 120E. The adoption began from Jan 1, 1896. The original text can be
 705 # found on Wikisource:
 706 # https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/標準時ニ關スル件_(公布時)
 707 # ... This could be the first adoption of time zone in Taiwan, because
 708 # during the Qing Dynasty, it seems that there was no time zone
 709 # declared officially.
 710 #
 711 # Later, in the beginning of World War II, on Sep 25, 1937, the Showa
 712 # Emperor announced Ordinance No. 529 of Showa Year 12 &quot;The clause of
 713 # revision in the ordinance No. 167 of Meiji year 28 about standard
 714 # time&quot;, in which abolished the adoption of Western Standard Time in
 715 # western islands (listed above), which means the whole Japan
 716 # territory, including later occupations, adopt Japan Central Time
 717 # (UT+9). The adoption began on Oct 1, 1937. The original text can
 718 # be found on Wikisource:
 719 # https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/明治二十八年勅令第百六十七號標準時ニ關スル件中改正ノ件
 720 #
 721 # That is, the time zone of Taipei switched to UT+9 on Oct 1, 1937.
 722 
 723 # From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
 724 # I&#39;ve found more evidence about when the time zone was switched from UT+9
 725 # back to UT+8 after WW2.  I believe it was on Sep 21, 1945.  In a document
 726 # during Japanese era [1] in which the officer told the staff to change time
 727 # zone back to Western Standard Time (UT+8) on Sep 21.  And in another
 728 # history page of National Cheng Kung University [2], on Sep 21 there is a
 729 # note &quot;from today, switch back to Western Standard Time&quot;.  From these two
 730 # materials, I believe that the time zone change happened on Sep 21.  And
 731 # today I have found another monthly journal called &quot;The Astronomical Herald&quot;
 732 # from The Astronomical Society of Japan [3] in which it mentioned the fact
 733 # that:
 734 #
 735 # 1. Standard Time of the Country (Japan) was adopted on Jan 1, 1888, using
 736 # the time at 135E (GMT+9)
 737 #
 738 # 2. Standard Time of the Country was renamed to Central Standard Time, on Jan
 739 # 1, 1898, and on the same day, the new territories Taiwan and Penghu islands,
 740 # as well as Yaeyama and Miyako islands, adopted a new time zone called
 741 # Western Standard Time, which is in GMT+8.
 742 #
 743 # 3. Western Standard Time was deprecated on Sep 30, 1937. From then all the
 744 # territories of Japan adopted the same time zone, which is Central Standard
 745 # Time.

 754 # Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-03):
 755 # I finally have found the real official gazette about changing back to
 756 # Western Standard Time on Sep 21 in Taiwan.  It&#39;s Taiwan Governor-General
 757 # Bulletin No. 386 in Showa 20 years (1945), published on Sep 19, 1945. [1] ...
 758 # [It] abolishes Bulletin No. 207 in Showa 12 years (1937), which is a local
 759 # bulletin in Taiwan for that Ordinance No. 529. It also mentioned that 1am on
 760 # Sep 21, 1945 will be 12am on Sep 21.  I think this bulletin is much more
 761 # official than the one I mentioned in my first mail, because it&#39;s from the
 762 # top-level government in Taiwan. If you&#39;re going to quote any resource, this
 763 # would be a good one.

 767 # From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
 768 # In 1946, DST in Taiwan was from May 15 and ended on Sep 30. The info from

 774 #
 775 # In 1947, DST in Taiwan was expanded to Oct 31. There is a backup of that
 776 # telegram announcement from Taiwan Province Government:

 779 #
 780 # Here is a brief translation:
 781 #
 782 #   The Summer Time this year is adopted from midnight Apr 15 until Sep 20
 783 #   midnight. To save (energy?) consumption, we&#39;re expanding Summer Time
 784 #   adoption till Oct 31 midnight.
 785 #
 786 # The Central Weather Bureau website didn&#39;t mention that, however it can
 787 # be found from historical government announcement database.
 788 
 789 # From Paul Eggert (2014-07-03):
 790 # As per Yu-Cheng Chuang, say that Taiwan was at UT +09 from 1937-10-01
 791 # until 1945-09-21 at 01:00, overriding Shanks &amp; Pottenger.

 823 #   A database for searching titles of legal documents of Macau in
 824 #   Chinese and Portuguese.  The term &quot;HORÁRIO DE VERÃO&quot; can be used for
 825 #   searching decrees about summer time.
 826 # * Archives of Macao
 827 #   http://www.archives.gov.mo/en/bo/
 828 #   It contains images of old official gazettes.
 829 # * The Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau have a page listing the
 830 #   summer time history.  But it is not complete and has some mistakes.
 831 #   http://www.smg.gov.mo/smg/geophysics/e_t_Summer%20Time.htm
 832 # Macau adopted GMT+8 on 30 Oct 1904 to follow Hong Kong.  Clocks were
 833 # advanced by 25 minutes and 50 seconds.  Which means the LMT used was
 834 # +7:34:10.  As stated in the &quot;Portaria No. 204&quot; dated 21 October 1904
 835 # and published in the Official Gazette on 29 October 1904.

1004 # Today&#39;s _Economist_ (p 60) reports that Georgia moved its clocks forward
1005 # an hour recently, due to a law proposed by Zurab Murvanidze,
1006 # an MP who went on a hunger strike for 11 days to force discussion about it!
1007 # We have no details, but we&#39;ll guess they didn&#39;t move the clocks back in fall.
1008 #
1009 # From Mathew Englander, quoting AP (1996-10-23 13:05-04):
1010 # Instead of putting back clocks at the end of October, Georgia
1011 # will stay on daylight savings time this winter to save energy,
1012 # President Eduard Shevardnadze decreed Wednesday.
1013 #
1014 # From the BBC via Joseph S. Myers (2004-06-27):
1015 #
1016 # Georgia moved closer to Western Europe on Sunday...  The former Soviet
1017 # republic has changed its time zone back to that of Moscow.  As a result it
1018 # is now just four hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time, rather than five hours
1019 # ahead.  The switch was decreed by the pro-Western president of Georgia,
1020 # Mikheil Saakashvili, who said the change was partly prompted by the process
1021 # of integration into Europe.
1022 
1023 # From Teimuraz Abashidze (2005-11-07):
1024 # Government of Georgia ... decided to NOT CHANGE daylight savings time on
1025 # [Oct.] 30, as it was done before during last more than 10 years.
1026 # Currently, we are in fact GMT +4:00, as before 30 October it was GMT
1027 # +3:00.... The problem is, there is NO FORMAL LAW or governmental document

1086 # In January 1906, several thousand cotton-mill workers rioted on the

1090 
1091 # From Paul Eggert (2017-04-20):
1092 # Good luck trying to nail down old timekeeping records in India.
1093 # &quot;... in the nineteenth century ... Madras Observatory took its magnetic
1094 # measurements on Göttingen time, its meteorological measurements on Madras
1095 # (local) time, dropped its time ball on Greenwich (ocean navigator&#39;s) time,
1096 # and distributed civil (local time).&quot; -- Bartky IR. Selling the true time:
1097 # 19th-century timekeeping in america. Stanford U Press (2000), 247 note 19.
1098 # &quot;A more potent cause of resistance to the general adoption of the present
1099 # standard time lies in the fact that it is Madras time.  The citizen of
1100 # Bombay, proud of being &#39;primus in Indis&#39; and of Calcutta, equally proud of
1101 # his city being the Capital of India, and - for a part of the year - the Seat
1102 # of the Supreme Government, alike look down on Madras, and refuse to change
1103 # the time they are using, for that of what they regard as a benighted
1104 # Presidency; while Madras, having for long given the standard time to the
1105 # rest of India, would resist the adoption of any other Indian standard in its
1106 # place.&quot; -- Oldham RD. On Time in India: a suggestion for its improvement.
1107 # Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (April 1899), 49-55.
1108 #
1109 # &quot;In 1870 ... Madras time - &#39;now used by the telegraph and regulated from the
1110 # only government observatory&#39; - was suggested as a standard railway time,
1111 # first to be adopted on the Great Indian Peninsular Railway (GIPR)....

1118 # This lists +052110 as Madras local time used in railways, and says that on
1119 # 1906-01-01 railways and telegraphs in India switched to +0530.  Some
1120 # municipalities retained their former time, and the time in Calcutta
1121 # continued to depend on whether you were at the railway station or at
1122 # government offices.  Government time was at +055320 (according to Shanks) or
1123 # at +0554 (according to the Indian Year Book).  Railway time is more
1124 # appropriate for our purposes, as it was better documented, it is what we do
1125 # elsewhere (e.g., Europe/London before 1880), and after 1906 it was
1126 # consistent in the region now identified by Asia/Kolkata.  So, use railway
1127 # time for 1870-1941.  Shanks is our only (and dubious) source for the

1220 # This is an English translation of what I just found (originally in Persian).
1221 # The Gregorian dates in brackets are mine:
1222 #
1223 #	Official Newspaper No. 13548-1370/6/25 [1991-09-16]

1226 #	The Rule About Change of the Official Time of the Country
1227 #
1228 #	The Board of Ministers, in the meeting dated 1370/5/23 [1991-08-14],
1229 #	based on the suggestion number 2221/D dated 1370/4/22 [1991-07-13]
1230 #	of the Country&#39;s Organization for Official and Employment Affairs,
1231 #	and referring to the law for equating the working hours of workers
1232 #	and officers in the whole country dated 1359/4/23 [1980-07-14], and
1233 #	for synchronizing the official times of the country, agreed that:
1234 #
1235 #	The official time of the country will should move forward one hour
1236 #	at the 24[:00] hours of the first day of Farvardin and should return
1237 #	to its previous state at the 24[:00] hours of the 30th day of
1238 #	Shahrivar.
1239 #
1240 #	First Deputy to the President - Hassan Habibi
1241 #
1242 # From personal experience, that agrees with what has been followed
1243 # for at least the last 5 years.  Before that, for a few years, the
1244 # date used was the first Thursday night of Farvardin and the last
1245 # Thursday night of Shahrivar, but I can&#39;t give exact dates....
1246 #
1247 # From Roozbeh Pournader (2005-04-05):
1248 # The text of the Iranian law, in effect since 1925, clearly mentions
1249 # that the true solar year is the measure, and there is no arithmetic
1250 # leap year calculation involved.  There has never been any serious
1251 # plan to change that law....
1252 #
1253 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
1254 # Go with Shanks &amp; Pottenger before Sept. 1991, and with Pournader thereafter.
1255 # I used Ed Reingold&#39;s cal-persia in GNU Emacs 21.2 to check Persian dates,
1256 # stopping after 2037 when 32-bit time_t&#39;s overflow.
1257 # That cal-persia used Birashk&#39;s approximation, which disagrees with the solar
1258 # calendar predictions for the year 2025, so I corrected those dates by hand.
1259 #
1260 # From Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-03-30), writing about future
1261 # discrepancies between cal-persia and the Iranian calendar:
1262 # For 2091 solar-longitude-after yields 2091-03-20 08:40:07.7 UT for
1263 # the vernal equinox and that gets so close to 12:00 some local
1264 # Iranian time that the definition of the correct location needs to be
1265 # known exactly, amongst other factors.  2157 is even closer:
1266 # 2157-03-20 08:37:15.5 UT.  But the Gregorian year 2025 should give
1267 # no interpretation problem whatsoever.  By the way, another instant
1268 # in the near future where there will be a discrepancy between
1269 # arithmetical and astronomical Iranian calendars will be in 2058:
1270 # vernal equinox on 2058-03-20 09:03:05.9 UT.  The Java version of
1271 # Reingold&#39;s/Dershowitz&#39; calculator gives correctly the Gregorian date
1272 # 2058-03-21 for 1 Farvardin 1437 (astronomical).
1273 #

1359 # From Jonathan Lennox (2000-06-12):
1360 # An article in this week&#39;s Economist (&quot;Inside the Saddam-free zone&quot;, p. 50 in
1361 # the U.S. edition) on the Iraqi Kurds contains a paragraph:
1362 # &quot;The three northern provinces ... switched their clocks this spring and
1363 # are an hour ahead of Baghdad.&quot;
1364 #
1365 # But Rives McDow (2000-06-18) quotes a contact in Iraqi-Kurdistan as follows:
1366 # In the past, some Kurdish nationalists, as a protest to the Iraqi
1367 # Government, did not adhere to daylight saving time.  They referred
1368 # to daylight saving as Saddam time.  But, as of today, the time zone
1369 # in Iraqi-Kurdistan is on standard time with Baghdad, Iraq.
1370 #
1371 # So we&#39;ll ignore the Economist&#39;s claim.

1405 # From Ephraim Silverberg (2001-01-11):
1406 #
1407 # I coined &quot;IST/IDT&quot; circa 1988.  Until then there were three
1408 # different abbreviations in use:
1409 #
1410 # JST  Jerusalem Standard Time [Danny Braniss, Hebrew University]
1411 # IZT  Israel Zonal (sic) Time [Prof. Haim Papo, Technion]
1412 # EEST Eastern Europe Standard Time [used by almost everyone else]
1413 #
1414 # Since timezones should be called by country and not capital cities,
1415 # I ruled out JST.  As Israel is in Asia Minor and not Eastern Europe,
1416 # EEST was equally unacceptable.  Since &quot;zonal&quot; was not compatible with
1417 # any other timezone abbreviation, I felt that &#39;IST&#39; was the way to go
1418 # and, indeed, it has received almost universal acceptance in timezone
1419 # settings in Israeli computers.
1420 #
1421 # In any case, I am happy to share timezone abbreviations with India,
1422 # high on my favorite-country list (and not only because my wife&#39;s
1423 # family is from India).

1474 # (1997-03-04, 1998-03-16, 1998-12-28, 2000-01-17, 2000-07-25, 2004-12-22,
1475 # and 2005-02-17):
1476 
1477 # According to the Office of the Secretary General of the Ministry of
1478 # Interior, there is NO set rule for Daylight-Savings/Standard time changes.
1479 # One thing is entrenched in law, however: that there must be at least 150
1480 # days of daylight savings time annually.  From 1993-1998, the change to
1481 # daylight savings time was on a Friday morning from midnight IST to
1482 # 1 a.m IDT; up until 1998, the change back to standard time was on a
1483 # Saturday night from midnight daylight savings time to 11 p.m. standard
1484 # time.  1996 is an exception to this rule where the change back to standard
1485 # time took place on Sunday night instead of Saturday night to avoid
1486 # conflicts with the Jewish New Year.  In 1999, the change to
1487 # daylight savings time was still on a Friday morning but from
1488 # 2 a.m. IST to 3 a.m. IDT; furthermore, the change back to standard time
1489 # was also on a Friday morning from 2 a.m. IDT to 1 a.m. IST for
1490 # 1999 only.  In the year 2000, the change to daylight savings time was
1491 # similar to 1999, but although the change back will be on a Friday, it
1492 # will take place from 1 a.m. IDT to midnight IST.  Starting in 2001, all
1493 # changes to/from will take place at 1 a.m. old time, but now there is no
1494 # rule as to what day of the week it will take place in as the start date
1495 # (except in 2003) is the night after the Passover Seder (i.e. the eve
1496 # of the 16th of Nisan in the lunar Hebrew calendar) and the end date
1497 # (except in 2002) is three nights before Yom Kippur [Day of Atonement]
1498 # (the eve of the 7th of Tishrei in the lunar Hebrew calendar).

1823 # &lt;http://www.kazsociety.org.uk/news/2005/03/30.htm&gt; (2005-03-21):
1824 # The Government of Kazakhstan passed a resolution March 15 abolishing
1825 # daylight saving time citing lack of economic benefits and health
1826 # complications coupled with a decrease in productivity.
1827 #
1828 # From Branislav Kojic (in Astana) via Gwillim Law (2005-06-28):
1829 # ... what happened was that the former Kazakhstan Eastern time zone
1830 # was &quot;blended&quot; with the Central zone.  Therefore, Kazakhstan now has
1831 # two time zones, and difference between them is one hour.  The zone
1832 # closer to UTC is the former Western zone (probably still called the
1833 # same), encompassing four provinces in the west: Aqtöbe, Atyraū,
1834 # Mangghystaū, and West Kazakhstan.  The other zone encompasses
1835 # everything else....  I guess that would make Kazakhstan time zones
1836 # de jure UTC+5 and UTC+6 respectively.
1837 
1838 # From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-27):
1839 # Review of the linked documents from http://adilet.zan.kz/

1842 # 0. Act of the Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR
1843 # from 1991-02-04 No. 20
1844 # http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&amp;nd=102010545
1845 # removed the extra hour (&quot;decree time&quot;) on the territory of the USSR
1846 # starting with the last Sunday of March 1991.
1847 # It also allowed (but not mandated) Kazakh SSR, Kirghiz SSR, Tajik SSR,
1848 # Turkmen SSR and Uzbek SSR to not have &quot;summer&quot; time.
1849 #
1850 # The 1992-01-13 act also refers to the act of the Cabinet of Ministers

1852 # of Ministers of the USSR from 1991-02-04 No. 20&quot; but I didn&#39;t found its
1853 # text.

1856 # (page 6; available at http://libinfo.org/newsr/newsr2574.djvu via

1859 # Republic of Georgia, Latvian SSR, Lithuanian SSR, SSR Moldova,
1860 # Estonian SSR; Komi ASSR; Kaliningrad oblast; Nenets autonomous okrug

1862 # Kazakh SSR (excluding Uralsk oblast); Republic of Kyrgyzstan, Tajik
1863 # SSR; Andijan, Jizzakh, Namangan, Sirdarya, Tashkent, Fergana oblasts
1864 # of the Uzbek SSR were to move clocks 1 hour backwards.
1865 # Other territories were to not move clocks.

1868 # Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Tajikistan.
1869 #
1870 # Apparently there were last minute changes. Apparently Kazakh act No. 170
1871 # was one of such changes.
1872 #
1873 # https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Декретное время
1874 # claims that Sovetskaya Rossiya newspaper on 1991-03-29 published that
1875 # Nenets autonomous okrug, Komi and Kazakhstan (excluding Uralsk oblast)
1876 # were to not move clocks and Uralsk oblast was to move clocks
1877 # forward; on 1991-09-29 Kazakhstan was to move clocks backwards.
1878 # (Probably there were changes even after that publication. There is an
1879 # article claiming that Kaliningrad oblast decided on 1991-03-29 to not
1880 # move clocks.)
1881 #
1882 # This implies that on 1991-03-31 Asia/Oral remained on +04/+05 while
1883 # the rest of Kazakhstan switched from +06/+07 to +05/06 or from +05/06
1884 # to +04/+05. It&#39;s unclear how Qyzylorda oblast moved into the fifth

1894 # on the whole territory of Kazakhstan 1 hour forward on 1992-01-19 at
1895 # 2:00, specified DST rules.  It acknowledged that Kazakhstan was
1896 # located in the fourth and the fifth time belts and specified the

1898 # oblasts (notably including Turgai and Qyzylorda oblasts into the fifth
1899 # time belt).

2301 # General Information Mongolia
2302 # &lt;http://www.mongoliatourism.gov.mn/general.htm&gt; (1999-09)
2303 # &quot;Time: Mongolia has two time zones. Three westernmost provinces of
2304 # Bayan-Ölgii, Uvs, and Hovd are one hour earlier than the capital city, and
2305 # the rest of the country follows the Ulaanbaatar time, which is UTC/GMT plus
2306 # eight hours.&quot;
2307 
2308 # From Rives McDow (1999-12-13):
2309 # Mongolia discontinued the use of daylight savings time in 1999; 1998
2310 # being the last year it was implemented.  The dates of implementation I am
2311 # unsure of, but most probably it was similar to Russia, except for the time
2312 # of implementation may have been different....
2313 # Some maps in the past have indicated that there was an additional time
2314 # zone in the eastern part of Mongolia, including the provinces of Dornod,
2315 # Sükhbaatar, and possibly Khentii.
2316 
2317 # From Paul Eggert (1999-12-15):
2318 # Naming and spelling is tricky in Mongolia.
2319 # We&#39;ll use Hovd (also spelled Chovd and Khovd) to represent the west zone;
2320 # the capital of the Hovd province is sometimes called Hovd, sometimes Dund-Us,
2321 # and sometimes Jirgalanta (with variant spellings), but the name Hovd
2322 # is good enough for our purposes.
2323 
2324 # From Rives McDow (2001-05-13):
2325 # In addition to Mongolia starting daylight savings as reported earlier
2326 # (adopted DST on 2001-04-27 02:00 local time, ending 2001-09-28),

2609 
2610 # From Amos Shapir (1998-02-15):
2611 #
2612 # From 1917 until 1948-05-15, all of Palestine, including the parts now
2613 # known as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, was under British rule.
2614 # Therefore the rules given for Israel for that period, apply there too...
2615 #
2616 # The Gaza Strip was under Egyptian rule between 1948-05-15 until 1967-06-05
2617 # (except a short occupation by Israel from 1956-11 till 1957-03, but no
2618 # time zone was affected then).  It was never formally annexed to Egypt,
2619 # though.
2620 #
2621 # The rest of Palestine was under Jordanian rule at that time, formally
2622 # annexed in 1950 as the West Bank (and the word &quot;Trans&quot; was dropped from
2623 # the country&#39;s previous name of &quot;the Hashemite Kingdom of the
2624 # Trans-Jordan&quot;).  So the rules for Jordan for that time apply.  Major
2625 # towns in that area are Nablus (Shchem), El-Halil (Hebron), Ramallah, and
2626 # East Jerusalem.
2627 #
2628 # Both areas were occupied by Israel in June 1967, but not annexed (except
2629 # for East Jerusalem).  They were on Israel time since then; there might
2630 # have been a Military Governor&#39;s order about time zones, but I&#39;m not aware
2631 # of any (such orders may have been issued semi-annually whenever summer
2632 # time was in effect, but maybe the legal aspect of time was just neglected).

2635 # towns in the West Bank and Gaza by 1995.  I know that in order to
2636 # demonstrate...independence, they have been switching to
2637 # summer time and back on a different schedule than Israel&#39;s, but I don&#39;t
2638 # know when this was started, or what algorithm is used (most likely the

2654 # with Shapir and assume that it observed DST from 1940 through 1947,
2655 # and that it used Jordanian rules starting in 1996.
2656 # We don&#39;t yet need a separate entry for the West Bank, since
2657 # the only differences between it and Gaza that we know about
2658 # occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
2659 # However, as we get more information, we may need to add entries
2660 # for parts of the West Bank as they transitioned from Israel&#39;s rules
2661 # to Palestine&#39;s rules.

3005 #
3006 # From Paul Eggert (2018-08-29):
3007 # Time in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian peninsula was not
3008 # standardized until 1968 or so; we don&#39;t know exactly when, and possibly it
3009 # has never been made official.  Richard P Hunt, in &quot;Islam city yielding to
3010 # modern times&quot;, New York Times (1961-04-09), p 20, wrote that only airlines
3011 # observed standard time, and that people in Jeddah mostly observed quasi-solar
3012 # time, doing so by setting their watches at sunrise to 6 o&#39;clock (or to 12
3013 # o&#39;clock for &quot;Arab&quot; time).
3014 #
3015 # Timekeeping differed depending on who you were and which part of Saudi
3016 # Arabia you were in.  In 1969, Elias Antar wrote that although a common
3017 # practice had been to set one&#39;s watch to 12:00 (i.e., midnight) at sunset -
3018 # which meant that the time on one side of a mountain could differ greatly from
3019 # the time on the other side - many foreigners set their watches to 6pm
3020 # instead, while airlines instead used UTC +03 (except in Dhahran, where they
3021 # used UTC +04), Aramco used UTC +03 with DST, and the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line
3022 # Company used Aramco time in eastern Saudi Arabia and airline time in western.
3023 # (The American Military Aid Advisory Group used plain UTC.)  Antar writes,
3024 # &quot;A man named Higgins, so the story goes, used to run a local power
3025 # station. One day, the whole thing became too much for Higgins and he
3026 # assembled his staff and laid down the law. &#39;I&#39;ve had enough of this,&#39; he
3027 # shrieked. &#39;It is now 12 o&#39;clock Higgins Time, and from now on this station is
3028 # going to run on Higgins Time.&#39; And so, until last year, it did.&quot;  See:
3029 # Antar E. Dinner at When? Saudi Aramco World, 1969 March/April. 2-3.
3030 # http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/196902/dinner.at.when.htm
3031 # newspapers.com says a similar story about Higgins was published in the Port
3032 # Angeles (WA) Evening News, 1965-03-10, page 5, but I lack access to the text.
3033 #
3034 # The TZ database cannot represent quasi-solar time; airline time is the best
3035 # we can do.  The 1946 foreign air news digest of the U.S. Civil Aeronautics
3036 # Board (OCLC 42299995) reported that the &quot;... Arabian Government, inaugurated
3037 # a weekly Dhahran-Cairo service, via the Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and
3038 # Jidda, on March 14, 1947&quot;.  Shanks &amp; Pottenger guessed 1950; go with the
3039 # earlier date.
3040 #
3041 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger also state that until 1968-05-01 Saudi Arabia had two
3042 # time zones; the other zone, at UT +04, was in the far eastern part of
3043 # the country.  Presumably this is documenting airline time.  Ignore this,
3044 # as it&#39;s before our 1970 cutoff.

3344 # From Paul Eggert (2014-10-04):
3345 # Milne gives 7:16:56 for the meridian of Saigon in 1899, as being
3346 # used in Lower Laos, Cambodia, and Annam.  But this is quite a ways
3347 # from Saigon&#39;s location.  For now, ignore this and stick with Shanks
3348 # and Pottenger for LMT before 1906.

3350 # From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-18):
3351 # The English-language name of Vietnam&#39;s most populous city is &quot;Ho Chi Minh

3353 
3354 # From Paul Eggert (2014-10-21) after a heads-up from Trần Ngọc Quân:
3355 # Trần Tiến Bình&#39;s authoritative book &quot;Lịch Việt Nam: thế kỷ XX-XXI (1901-2100)&quot;
3356 # (Nhà xuất bản Văn Hoá - Thông Tin, Hanoi, 2005), pp 49-50,
3357 # is quoted verbatim in:
3358 # http://www.thoigian.com.vn/?mPage=P80D01
3359 # is translated by Brian Inglis in:
3360 # https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2014-October/021654.html
3361 # and is the basis for the information below.
3362 #
3363 # The 1906 transition was effective July 1 and standardized Indochina to
3364 # Phù Liễn Observatory, legally 104° 17&#39; 17&quot; east of Paris.
3365 # It&#39;s unclear whether this meant legal Paris Mean Time (00:09:21) or
3366 # the Paris Meridian (2° 20&#39; 14.03&quot; E); the former yields 07:06:30.1333...
3367 # and the latter 07:06:29.333... so either way it rounds to 07:06:30,
3368 # which is used below even though the modern-day Phù Liễn Observatory
3369 # is closer to 07:06:31.  Abbreviate Phù Liễn Mean Time as PLMT.
3370 #
3371 # The following transitions occurred in Indochina in general (before 1954)
3372 # and in South Vietnam in particular (after 1954):
3373 # To 07:00 on 1911-05-01.
3374 # To 08:00 on 1942-12-31 at 23:00.
3375 # To 09:00 in 1945-03-14 at 23:00.
3376 # To 07:00 on 1945-09-02 in Vietnam.
3377 # To 08:00 on 1947-04-01 in French-controlled Indochina.
3378 # To 07:00 on 1955-07-01 in South Vietnam.
3379 # To 08:00 on 1959-12-31 at 23:00 in South Vietnam.
3380 # To 07:00 on 1975-06-13 in South Vietnam.
