278 # Vostok, which is one of the Russian stations, is set on the same
279 # time as Moscow, Russia.
280 #
281 # From Lee Hotz (2001-03-08):
282 # I queried the folks at Columbia who spent the summer at Vostok and this is
283 # what they had to say about time there:
284 # &quot;in the US Camp (East Camp) we have been on New Zealand (McMurdo)
285 # time, which is 12 hours ahead of GMT. The Russian Station Vostok was
286 # 6 hours behind that (although only 2 miles away, i.e. 6 hours ahead
287 # of GMT). This is a time zone I think two hours east of Moscow. The
288 # natural time zone is in between the two: 8 hours ahead of GMT.&quot;
289 #
290 # From Paul Eggert (2001-05-04):
291 # This seems to be hopelessly confusing, so I asked Lee Hotz about it
292 # in person.  He said that some Antarctic locations set their local
293 # time so that noon is the warmest part of the day, and that this
294 # changes during the year and does not necessarily correspond to mean
295 # solar noon.  So the Vostok time might have been whatever the clocks
296 # happened to be during their visit.  So we still don&#39;t really know what time
297 # it is at Vostok.  But we&#39;ll guess +06.

350 # as supplies for the station were coming from McMurdo Sound,

352 # at that time (1957).  (Source: Siple&#39;s book 90 Degrees South.)

356 # (1995-11-13 16:24:56 +1300, no longer available):
357 # We use the same time as McMurdo does.
358 # And they use the same time as Christchurch, NZ does....
359 # One last quirk about South Pole time.
360 # All the electric clocks are usually wrong.
361 # Something about the generators running at 60.1hertz or something
362 # makes all of the clocks run fast.  So every couple of days,
363 # we have to go around and set them back 5 minutes or so.
364 # Maybe if we let them run fast all of the time, we&#39;d get to leave here sooner!!
