45 # There were no leap seconds before 1972, because the official mechanism
46 # accounting for the discrepancy between atomic time and the earth&#39;s rotation
47 # did not exist.
48 
49 # The correction (+ or -) is made at the given time, so lines
50 # will typically look like:
51 #	Leap	YEAR	MON	DAY	23:59:60	+	R/S
52 # or
53 #	Leap	YEAR	MON	DAY	23:59:59	-	R/S
54 
55 # If the leap second is Rolling (R) the given time is local time (unused here).
