 129 # From Peter Ilieve (1994-07-06):
 130 #
 131 # On 17 Jan 1994 the Independent, a UK quality newspaper, had a piece about
 132 # historical vistas along the Thames in west London. There was a photo
 133 # and a sketch map showing some of the sightlines involved. One paragraph
 134 # of the text said:
 135 #
 136 # &#39;An old stone obelisk marking a forgotten terrestrial meridian stands
 137 # beside the river at Kew. In the 18th century, before time and longitude
 138 # was standardised by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, scholars observed
 139 # this stone and the movement of stars from Kew Observatory nearby. They
 140 # made their calculations and set the time for the Horse Guards and Parliament,
 141 # but now the stone is obscured by scrubwood and can only be seen by walking
 142 # along the towpath within a few yards of it.&#39;
 143 #
 144 # I have a one inch to one mile map of London and my estimate of the stone&#39;s
 145 # position is 51° 28&#39; 30&quot; N, 0° 18&#39; 45&quot; W. The longitude should
 146 # be within about ±2&quot;. The Ordnance Survey grid reference is TQ172761.

 150 # From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
 151 #
 152 # Howse writes that Britain was the first country to use standard time.
 153 # The railways cared most about the inconsistencies of local mean time,
 154 # and it was they who forced a uniform time on the country.
 155 # The original idea was credited to Dr. William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828)
 156 # and was popularized by Abraham Follett Osler (1808-1903).
 157 # The first railway to adopt London time was the Great Western Railway
 158 # in November 1840; other railways followed suit, and by 1847 most
 159 # (though not all) railways used London time.  On 1847-09-22 the
 160 # Railway Clearing House, an industry standards body, recommended that GMT be
 161 # adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it.
 162 # The transition occurred on 12-01 for the L&amp;NW, the Caledonian,
 163 # and presumably other railways; the January 1848 Bradshaw&#39;s lists many
 164 # railways as using GMT.  By 1855 the vast majority of public
 165 # clocks in Britain were set to GMT (though some, like the great clock
 166 # on Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, were fitted with two minute hands,
 167 # one for local time and one for GMT).  The last major holdout was the legal
 168 # system, which stubbornly stuck to local time for many years, leading

 536 # From Paul Eggert (2018-02-15):
 537 # In January 2018 we discovered that the negative SAVE values in the
 538 # Eire rules cause problems with tests for ICU:
 539 # https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025825.html
 540 # and with tests for OpenJDK:
 541 # https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025822.html
 542 #
 543 # To work around this problem, the build procedure can translate the
 544 # following data into two forms, one with negative SAVE values and the
 545 # other form with a traditional approximation for Irish timestamps
 546 # after 1971-10-31 02:00 UTC; although this approximation has tm_isdst
 547 # flags that are reversed, its UTC offsets are correct and this often
 548 # suffices.  This source file currently uses only nonnegative SAVE
 549 # values, but this is intended to change and downstream code should
 550 # not rely on it.
 551 #
 552 # The following is like GB-Eire and EU, except with standard time in
 553 # summer and negative daylight saving time in winter.  It is for when
 554 # negative SAVE values are used.

1601 #
1602 # From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
1603 # Sicily and Sardinia each had their own time zones from 1866 to 1893,
1604 # called Palermo Time (+00:53:28) and Cagliari Time (+00:36:32).
1605 # During World War II, German-controlled Italy used German time.
1606 # But these events all occurred before the 1970 cutoff,
1607 # so record only the time in Rome.
1608 #



















1609 # From Michael Deckers (2016-10-24):
1610 # http://www.ac-ilsestante.it/MERIDIANE/ora_legale quotes a law of 1893-08-10
1611 # ... [translated as] &quot;The preceding dispositions will enter into
1612 # force at the instant at which, according to the time specified in
1613 # the 1st article, the 1st of November 1893 will begin....&quot;
1614 #
1615 # From Pierpaolo Bernardi (2016-10-20):
1616 # The authoritative source for time in Italy is the national metrological
1617 # institute, which has a summary page of historical DST data at
1618 # http://www.inrim.it/res/tf/ora_legale_i.shtml

1619 # (2016-10-24):
1620 # http://www.renzobaldini.it/le-ore-legali-in-italia/
1621 # has still different data for 1944.  It divides Italy in two, as
1622 # there were effectively two governments at the time, north of Gothic
1623 # Line German controlled territory, official government RSI, and south
1624 # of the Gothic Line, controlled by allied armies.
1625 #
1626 # From Brian Inglis (2016-10-23):
1627 # Viceregal LEGISLATIVE DECREE. 14 September 1944, no. 219.
1628 # Restoration of Standard Time. (044U0219) (OJ 62 of 30.9.1944) ...
1629 # Given the R. law decreed on 1944-03-29, no. 92, by which standard time is

1631 # Starting at hour three on the date 1944-09-17 standard time will be resumed.
1632 #







1633 # From Paul Eggert (2016-10-27):
1634 # Go with INRiM for DST rules, except as corrected by Inglis for 1944
1635 # for the Kingdom of Italy.  This is consistent with Renzo Baldini.
1636 # Model Rome&#39;s occupation by using C-Eur rules from 1943-09-10

3633 # suggests that the transition was more gradual, and that the Swiss did not
3634 # agree about civil time during the transition.  The timekeeping it gives the
3635 # most detail for is postal and telegraph time: here, federal legislation (the

3883 # From Paul Eggert (2018-10-03):
3884 # As is usual in tzdb, Ukrainian zones use the most common English spellings.
3885 # For example, tzdb uses Europe/Kiev, as &quot;Kiev&quot; is the most common spelling in
3886 # English for Ukraine&#39;s capital, even though it is certainly wrong as a
3887 # transliteration of the Ukrainian &quot;Київ&quot;.  This is similar to tzdb&#39;s use of
3888 # Europe/Prague, which is certainly wrong as a transliteration of the Czech
3889 # &quot;Praha&quot;.  (&quot;Kiev&quot; came from old Slavic via Russian to English, and &quot;Prague&quot;
3890 # came from old Slavic via French to English, so the two cases have something
3891 # in common.)  Admittedly English-language spelling of Ukrainian names is
3892 # controversial, and some day &quot;Kyiv&quot; may become substantially more popular in
3893 # English; in the meantime, stick with the traditional English &quot;Kiev&quot; as that
3894 # means less disruption for our users.
<span class="line-removed">3895 #</span>
<span class="line-removed">3896 # Anyway, none of the common English-language spellings (Kiev, Kyiv, Kieff,</span>

 129 # From Peter Ilieve (1994-07-06):
 130 #
 131 # On 17 Jan 1994 the Independent, a UK quality newspaper, had a piece about
 132 # historical vistas along the Thames in west London. There was a photo
 133 # and a sketch map showing some of the sightlines involved. One paragraph
 134 # of the text said:
 135 #
 136 # &#39;An old stone obelisk marking a forgotten terrestrial meridian stands
 137 # beside the river at Kew. In the 18th century, before time and longitude
 138 # was standardised by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, scholars observed
 139 # this stone and the movement of stars from Kew Observatory nearby. They
 140 # made their calculations and set the time for the Horse Guards and Parliament,
 141 # but now the stone is obscured by scrubwood and can only be seen by walking
 142 # along the towpath within a few yards of it.&#39;
 143 #
 144 # I have a one inch to one mile map of London and my estimate of the stone&#39;s
 145 # position is 51° 28&#39; 30&quot; N, 0° 18&#39; 45&quot; W. The longitude should
 146 # be within about ±2&quot;. The Ordnance Survey grid reference is TQ172761.

 150 # From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
 151 #
 152 # Howse writes that Britain was the first country to use standard time.
 153 # The railways cared most about the inconsistencies of local mean time,
 154 # and it was they who forced a uniform time on the country.
 155 # The original idea was credited to Dr. William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828)
 156 # and was popularized by Abraham Follett Osler (1808-1903).
 157 # The first railway to adopt London time was the Great Western Railway
 158 # in November 1840; other railways followed suit, and by 1847 most
 159 # (though not all) railways used London time.  On 1847-09-22 the
 160 # Railway Clearing House, an industry standards body, recommended that GMT be
 161 # adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it.
 162 # The transition occurred on 12-01 for the L&amp;NW, the Caledonian,
 163 # and presumably other railways; the January 1848 Bradshaw&#39;s lists many
 164 # railways as using GMT.  By 1855 the vast majority of public
 165 # clocks in Britain were set to GMT (though some, like the great clock
 166 # on Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, were fitted with two minute hands,
 167 # one for local time and one for GMT).  The last major holdout was the legal
 168 # system, which stubbornly stuck to local time for many years, leading

 536 # From Paul Eggert (2018-02-15):
 537 # In January 2018 we discovered that the negative SAVE values in the
 538 # Eire rules cause problems with tests for ICU:
 539 # https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025825.html
 540 # and with tests for OpenJDK:
 541 # https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025822.html
 542 #
 543 # To work around this problem, the build procedure can translate the
 544 # following data into two forms, one with negative SAVE values and the
 545 # other form with a traditional approximation for Irish timestamps
 546 # after 1971-10-31 02:00 UTC; although this approximation has tm_isdst
 547 # flags that are reversed, its UTC offsets are correct and this often
 548 # suffices.  This source file currently uses only nonnegative SAVE
 549 # values, but this is intended to change and downstream code should
 550 # not rely on it.
 551 #
 552 # The following is like GB-Eire and EU, except with standard time in
 553 # summer and negative daylight saving time in winter.  It is for when
 554 # negative SAVE values are used.

3590 # summertime the church-clocks etc were set back one hour to show
3591 # 1916-10-01 00:00 standard time.  The article also reports that some

3594 # hour before the event took place.

3686 # suggests that the transition was more gradual, and that the Swiss did not
3687 # agree about civil time during the transition.  The timekeeping it gives the
3688 # most detail for is postal and telegraph time: here, federal legislation (the

3690 # 1851-11-23, and an official implementation notice was published 1853-07-16

3985 # transliteration of the Ukrainian &quot;Київ&quot;.  This is similar to tzdb&#39;s use of
3986 # Europe/Prague, which is certainly wrong as a transliteration of the Czech
3987 # &quot;Praha&quot;.  (&quot;Kiev&quot; came from old Slavic via Russian to English, and &quot;Prague&quot;
3988 # came from old Slavic via French to English, so the two cases have something
3989 # in common.)  Admittedly English-language spelling of Ukrainian names is
3990 # controversial, and some day &quot;Kyiv&quot; may become substantially more popular in
3991 # English; in the meantime, stick with the traditional English &quot;Kiev&quot; as that
3992 # means less disruption for our users.
