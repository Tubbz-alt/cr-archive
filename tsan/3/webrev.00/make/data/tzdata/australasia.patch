+# officers that describe the time used in islands when they visited there.

+# at 1968-06-26 00:00 JST.  The exact periods of DST are still unknown.

+# Because their last time change to return to Japanese time when they returned
+# to Japanese rule was right before 1970, ... per the current tz database
+# rule, the information doesn't warrant creation of a new timezone for Bonin
+# Islands itself and is thus as an anecdotal note for interest purpose only.
+# ... [The abovementioned link] described some special timekeeping phenomenon
+# regarding Marcus island, another remote island currently owned by Japanese
+# in the same administrative unit as Bonin Islands.  Many reports claim that
+# the American coastal guard on the American quarter of the island use its own
+# coastal guard time, and most sources describe the time as UTC+11, being two
+# hours faster than JST used by some Japanese personnel on the island.  Some
+# sites describe it as same as Wake Island/Guam time although it would be
+# incorrect to be same as Guam.  And then in a few Japanese governmental
+# report from 1980s (from National Institute of Information and Communications
+# Technology) regarding the construction of VLBI facility on the Marcus
+# Island, it claimed that there are three time standards being used on the

+#
+# Japan invaded those islands in 1914, and records shows that they were
+# instructed to use JST at the time.
+#
+# 1915 January telecommunication record on the Jaluit Atoll shows they use
+# the meridian of 170E as standard time (GMT+11:20), which is similar to the
+# longitude of the atoll.
+# 1915 February record say the 170E standard time is to be used until

+# However these are time used within the Japanese Military at the time and
+# probably does not reflect the time used by local resident at the time (that
+# is if they keep their own time back then)
+#
+# In January 1919 the occupying force issued a command that split the area
+# into three different timezone with meridian of 135E, 150E, 165E (JST+0, +1,
+# +2), and the command was to become effective from February 1 of the same
+# year.  Despite the target of the command is still only for the occupying
+# force itself, further publication have described the time as the standard

+#  * Area that use meridian of 165E: Ponape (Pohnpei) and Jaluit civil
+#    administration area (Southern Islands Eastern Standard Time).
+#  * In the next few years Japanese occupation of those islands have been
+#    formalized via League of Nation Mandate (South Pacific Mandate) and formal
+#    governance structure have been established, these district [become
+#    subprefectures] and timezone classification have been inherited as standard
+#    time of the area.
+#  * Saipan subprefecture include Mariana islands (exclude Guam which was
+#    occupied by America at the time), Palau and Yap subprefecture rule the
+#    Western Caroline Islands with 137E longitude as border, Truk and Ponape
+#    subprefecture rule the Eastern Caroline Islands with 154E as border, Ponape
+#    subprefecture also rule part of Marshall Islands to the west of 164E
+#    starting from (1918?) and Jaluit subprefecture rule the rest of the
+#    Marshall Islands.
+#
+# And then in year 1937, an announcement was made to change the time in the
+# area into 2 timezones:
+#  * Area that use meridian of 135E: area administered by Palau, Yap and
+#    Saipan subprefecture (Southern Islands Western Standard Time)
+#  * Area that use meridian of 150E: area administered by Truk (Chuuk),
+#    Ponape (Pohnpei) and Jaluit subprefecture (Southern Islands Eastern
+#    Standard Time)
+#
+# Another announcement issued in 1941 say that on April 1 that year,
+# standard time of the Southern Islands would be changed to use the meridian
+# of 135E (GMT+9), and thus abolishing timezone different within the area.

+# Then Pacific theater of WWII started and Japan slowly lose control on the

+# After the end of WWII, in 1946 February, a document written by the
