24 # tzdb data for System V rules (this file is obsolete)
25 
26 # This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
27 # 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.
28 
29 # Old rules, should the need arise.
30 # No attempt is made to handle Newfoundland, since it cannot be expressed
31 # using the System V &quot;TZ&quot; scheme (half-hour offset), or anything outside
32 # North America (no support for non-standard DST start/end dates), nor
33 # the changes in the DST rules in the US after 1976 (which occurred after
34 # the old rules were written).
35 #
36 # If you need the old rules, uncomment ## lines.
37 # Compile this *without* leap second correction for true conformance.
