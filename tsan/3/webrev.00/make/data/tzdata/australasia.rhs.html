  77 # From Alex Livingston (1996-11-01):
  78 # I have heard or read more than once that some resort islands off the coast
  79 # of Queensland chose to keep observing daylight-saving time even after
  80 # Queensland ceased to.
  81 #
  82 # From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
  83 # IATA SSIM (1993-02/1994-09) say that the Holiday Islands (Hayman, Lindeman,
  84 # Hamilton) observed DST for two years after the rest of Queensland stopped.
  85 # Hamilton is the largest, but there is also a Hamilton in Victoria,
  86 # so use Lindeman.
  87 #
  88 # From J William Piggott (2016-02-20):
  89 # There is no location named Holiday Islands in Queensland Australia; holiday
  90 # islands is a colloquial term used globally.  Hayman and Lindeman are at the
  91 # north and south extremes of the Whitsunday Islands archipelago, and
  92 # Hamilton is in between; it is reasonable to believe that this time zone
  93 # applies to all of the Whitsundays.

 844 # Details are uncertain.  We have no data for Johnston after 1970, so

 851 # Johnston time, 1:30 AM Kwajalein time.&quot;  This was in June 1945, and

 854 # From Lyle McElhaney (2014-03-11):
 855 # [W]hen JI was being used for that [atomic bomb] testing, the time being used
 856 # was not Hawaiian time but rather the same time being used on the ships,
 857 # which had a GMT offset of -11 hours.  This apparently applied to at least the
 858 # time from Operation Newsreel (Hardtack I/Teak shot, 1958-08-01) to the last
 859 # Operation Fishbowl shot (Tightrope, 1962-11-04).... [See] Herman Hoerlin,

 955 # From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 956 # Daylight saving time has long been controversial in Australia, pitting
 957 # region against region, rural against urban, and local against global.
 958 # For example, in her review of Graeme Davison&#39;s _The Unforgiving
 959 # Minute: how Australians learned to tell the time_ (1993), Perth native
 960 # Phillipa J Martyr wrote, &quot;The section entitled &#39;Saving Daylight&#39; was
 961 # very informative, but was (as can, sadly, only be expected from a
 962 # Melbourne-based study) replete with the usual chuckleheaded
 963 # Queenslanders and straw-chewing yokels from the West prattling fables
 964 # about fading curtains and crazed farm animals.&quot;

 974 # Lawlink NSW:Daylight Saving in New South Wales
 975 # http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Corporate/ll_agdinfo.nsf/pages/community_relations_daylight_saving
 976 # covers New South Wales in particular.
 977 
 978 # From John Mackin (1991-03-06):
 979 # We in Australia have _never_ referred to DST as &#39;daylight&#39; time.
 980 # It is called &#39;summer&#39; time.  Now by a happy coincidence, &#39;summer&#39;
 981 # and &#39;standard&#39; happen to start with the same letter; hence, the
 982 # abbreviation does _not_ change...
 983 # The legislation does not actually define abbreviations, at least
 984 # in this State, but the abbreviation is just commonly taken to be the
 985 # initials of the phrase, and the legislation here uniformly uses
 986 # the phrase &#39;summer time&#39; and does not use the phrase &#39;daylight
 987 # time&#39;.
 988 # Announcers on the Commonwealth radio network, the ABC (for Australian
 989 # Broadcasting Commission), use the phrases &#39;Eastern Standard Time&#39;
 990 # or &#39;Eastern Summer Time&#39;.  (Note, though, that as I say in the
 991 # current australasia file, there is really no such thing.)  Announcers
 992 # on its overseas service, Radio Australia, use the same phrases
 993 # prefixed by the word &#39;Australian&#39; when referring to local times;
 994 # time announcements on that service, naturally enough, are made in UTC.
 995 
 996 # From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 997 #
 998 # Inspired by Mackin&#39;s remarks quoted above, earlier versions of this
 999 # file used &quot;EST&quot; for both Eastern Standard Time and Eastern Summer
1000 # Time in Australia, and similarly for &quot;CST&quot;, &quot;CWST&quot;, and &quot;WST&quot;.
1001 # However, these abbreviations were confusing and were not common
1002 # practice among Australians, and there were justifiable complaints
1003 # about them, so I attempted to survey current Australian usage.
1004 # For the tz database, the full English phrase is not that important;
1005 # what matters is the abbreviation.  It&#39;s difficult to survey the web
1006 # directly for abbreviation usage, as there are so many false hits for
1007 # strings like &quot;EST&quot; and &quot;EDT&quot;, so I looked for pages that defined an
1008 # abbreviation for eastern or central DST in Australia, and got the
1009 # following numbers of unique hits for the listed Google queries:
1010 #
1011 #   10 &quot;Eastern Daylight Time AEST&quot; site:au [some are false hits]
1012 #   10 &quot;Eastern Summer Time AEST&quot; site:au
1013 #   10 &quot;Summer Time AEDT&quot; site:au
1014 #   13 &quot;EDST Eastern Daylight Saving Time&quot; site:au
1015 #   18 &quot;Summer Time ESST&quot; site:au
1016 #   28 &quot;Eastern Daylight Saving Time EDST&quot; site:au
1017 #   39 &quot;EDT Eastern Daylight Time&quot; site:au [some are false hits]
1018 #   53 &quot;Eastern Daylight Time EDT&quot; site:au [some are false hits]
1019 #   54 &quot;AEDT Australian Eastern Daylight Time&quot; site:au
1020 #  182 &quot;Eastern Daylight Time AEDT&quot; site:au
1021 #
1022 #   17 &quot;Central Daylight Time CDT&quot; site:au [some are false hits]
1023 #   46 &quot;Central Daylight Time ACDT&quot; site:au
1024 #
1025 # I tried several other variants (e.g., &quot;Eastern Summer Time EST&quot;) but
1026 # they all returned fewer than 10 unique hits.  I also looked for pages
1027 # mentioning both &quot;western standard time&quot; and an abbreviation, since
1028 # there is no WST in the US to generate false hits, and found:
1029 #
1030 #  156 &quot;western standard time&quot; AWST site:au
1031 #  226 &quot;western standard time&quot; WST site:au
1032 #
1033 # I then surveyed the top ten newspapers in Australia by circulation as
1034 # listed in Wikipedia, using Google queries like &quot;AEDT site:heraldsun.com.au&quot;
1035 # and obtaining estimated counts from the initial page of search results.
1036 # All ten papers greatly preferred &quot;AEDT&quot; to &quot;EDT&quot;.  The papers
1037 # surveyed were the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Courier-Mail,
1038 # The Sydney Morning Herald, The West Australian, The Age, The Advertiser,
1039 # The Australian, The Financial Review, and The Herald (Newcastle).
1040 #
1041 # I also searched for historical usage, to see whether abbreviations
1042 # like &quot;AEDT&quot; are new.  A Trove search &lt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/&gt;
1043 # found only one newspaper (The Canberra Times) with a house style
1044 # dating back to the 1970s, I expect because other newspapers weren&#39;t
1045 # fully indexed.  The Canberra Times strongly preferred abbreviations
1046 # like &quot;AEDT&quot;.  The first occurrence of &quot;AEDT&quot; was a World Weather
1047 # column (1971-11-17, page 24), and of &quot;ACDT&quot; was a Scoreboard column
1048 # (1993-01-24, p 16).  The style was the typical usage but was not
1049 # strictly enforced; for example, &quot;Welcome to the twilight zones ...&quot;
1050 # (1994-10-29, p 1) uses the abbreviations AEST/AEDT, CST/CDT, and
1051 # WST, and goes on to say, &quot;The confusion and frustration some feel
1052 # about the lack of uniformity among Australia&#39;s six states and two
1053 # territories has prompted one group to form its very own political
1054 # party -- the Sydney-based Daylight Saving Extension Party.&quot;

1077 #   EST CST WST preferred for standard time; AEST AEDT ACST ACDT also used
1078 #
1079 #   The Transport Safety Bureau has an extensive series of accident reports,
1080 #   and investigators seem to use whatever abbreviation they like.
1081 #   Googling site:atsb.gov.au found the following number of unique hits:
1082 #   311 &quot;ESuT&quot;, 195 &quot;EDT&quot;, 26 &quot;AEDT&quot;, 83 &quot;CSuT&quot;, 46 &quot;CDT&quot;.
1083 #   &quot;_SuT&quot; tended to appear in older reports, and &quot;A_DT&quot; tended to
1084 #   appear in reports of events with international implications.
1085 #
1086 # From the above it appears that there is a working consensus in
1087 # Australia to use trailing &quot;DT&quot; for daylight saving time; although
1088 # some sources use trailing &quot;SST&quot; or &quot;ST&quot; or &quot;SuT&quot; they are by far in
1089 # the minority.  The case for leading &quot;A&quot; is weaker, but since it
1090 # seems to be preferred in the overall web and is preferred in all
1091 # the leading newspaper websites and in many government departments,
1092 # it has a stronger case than omitting the leading &quot;A&quot;.  The current
1093 # version of the database therefore uses abbreviations like &quot;AEST&quot; and
1094 # &quot;AEDT&quot; for Australian time zones.

1263 # coast of the continent.
1264 #
1265 # I paid particular attention to the time kept there. There can be no

1267 # village just inside the border with South Australia to as far west
1268 # as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is
1269 # the largest population centre in this zone....
1270 #
1271 # Now that Western Australia is observing daylight saving, the

1393 # discussing his book &quot;The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar
1394 # Observatories&quot;[1], and in particular the Shrine of Remembrance[2] located
1395 # in Melbourne, Australia.
1396 #
1397 # Apparently the shrine&#39;s main purpose is a beam of sunlight which
1398 # illuminates a special spot on the floor at the 11th hour of the 11th day
1399 # of the 11th month (Remembrance Day) every year in memory of Australia&#39;s
1400 # fallen WWI soldiers.  And if you go there on Nov. 11, at 11am local time,
1401 # you will indeed see the sunbeam illuminate the special spot at the
1402 # expected time.
1403 #
1404 # However, that is only because of some special mirror contraption that had
1405 # to be employed, since due to daylight savings time, the true solar time of
1406 # the remembrance moment occurs one hour later (or earlier?).  Perhaps
1407 # someone with more information on this jury-rig can tell us more.

1519 # Lord Howe Island advances clocks by 30 minutes during DST in NSW and retards

1521 # introduced in NSW, the &quot;changeover&quot; time on the Island has been 02:00 as

1927 # Pitcairn
1928 
1929 # From Rives McDow (1999-11-08):
1930 # A Proclamation was signed by the Governor of Pitcairn on the 27th March 1998
1931 # with regard to Pitcairn Standard Time.  The Proclamation is as follows.
1932 #
1933 #	The local time for general purposes in the Islands shall be
1934 #	Co-ordinated Universal time minus 8 hours and shall be known
1935 #	as Pitcairn Standard Time.
1936 #
1937 # ... I have also seen Pitcairn listed as UTC minus 9 hours in several
1938 # references, and can only assume that this was an error in interpretation
1939 # somehow in light of this proclamation.
1940 
1941 # From Rives McDow (1999-11-09):
1942 # The Proclamation regarding Pitcairn time came into effect on 27 April 1998
1943 # ... at midnight.
1944 
1945 # From Howie Phelps (1999-11-10), who talked to a Pitcairner via shortwave:
1946 # Betty Christian told me yesterday that their local time is the same as
1947 # Pacific Standard Time. They used to be ½ hour different from us here in
1948 # Sacramento but it was changed a couple of years ago.
1949 
1950 
1951 # (Western) Samoa and American Samoa
1952 
1953 # Howse writes (p 153) that after the 1879 standardization on Antipodean
1954 # time by the British governor of Fiji, the King of Samoa decided to change
1955 # &quot;the date in his kingdom from the Antipodean to the American system,
1956 # ordaining - by a masterpiece of diplomatic flattery - that
1957 # the Fourth of July should be celebrated twice in that year.&quot;
1958 # This happened in 1892, according to the Evening News (Sydney) of 1892-07-20.
1959 # https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/idl/idl.htm
1960 
1961 # Although Shanks &amp; Pottenger says they both switched to UT -11:30
1962 # in 1911, and to -11 in 1950. many earlier sources give -11
1963 # for American Samoa, e.g., the US National Bureau of Standards
1964 # circular &quot;Standard Time Throughout the World&quot;, 1932.
1965 # Assume American Samoa switched to -11 in 1911, not 1950,
1966 # and that after 1950 they agreed until (western) Samoa skipped a
1967 # day in 2011.  Assume also that the Samoas follow the US and New
1968 # Zealand&#39;s &quot;ST&quot;/&quot;DT&quot; style of daylight-saving abbreviations.

1971 # Tonga
1972 
1973 # From Paul Eggert (1996-01-22):
1974 # Today&#39;s _Wall Street Journal_ (p 1) reports that &quot;Tonga has been plotting
1975 # to sneak ahead of [New Zealanders] by introducing daylight-saving time.&quot;
1976 # Since Kiribati has moved the Date Line it&#39;s not clear what Tonga will do.
1977 
1978 # Don Mundell writes in the 1997-02-20 Tonga Chronicle
1979 # How Tonga became &#39;The Land where Time Begins&#39;:
1980 # http://www.tongatapu.net.to/tonga/homeland/timebegins.htm
1981 #
1982 # Until 1941 Tonga maintained a standard time 50 minutes ahead of NZST
1983 # 12 hours and 20 minutes ahead of GMT.  When New Zealand adjusted its
1984 # standard time in 1940s, Tonga had the choice of subtracting from its
1985 # local time to come on the same standard time as New Zealand or of
1986 # advancing its time to maintain the differential of 13°
1987 # (approximately 50 minutes ahead of New Zealand time).
1988 #
1989 # Because His Majesty King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV, then Crown Prince
1990 # Tungī, preferred to ensure Tonga&#39;s title as the land where time
1991 # begins, the Legislative Assembly approved the latter change.
1992 #
1993 # But some of the older, more conservative members from the outer
1994 # islands objected. &quot;If at midnight on Dec. 31, we move ahead 40
1995 # minutes, as your Royal Highness wishes, what becomes of the 40
1996 # minutes we have lost?&quot;
1997 #
1998 # The Crown Prince, presented an unanswerable argument: &quot;Remember that
1999 # on the World Day of Prayer, you would be the first people on Earth
2000 # to say your prayers in the morning.&quot;
2001 
2002 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
2003 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger say the transition was on 1968-10-01; go with Mundell.
2004 
2005 # From Eric Ulevik (1999-05-03):
2006 # Tonga&#39;s director of tourism, who is also secretary of the National Millennium
2007 # Committee, has a plan to get Tonga back in front.
2008 # He has proposed a one-off move to tropical daylight saving for Tonga from
2009 # October to March, which has won approval in principle from the Tongan
2010 # Government.
2011 
2012 # From Steffen Thorsen (1999-09-09):
2013 # * Tonga will introduce DST in November
2014 #
2015 # I was given this link by John Letts:

2017 #
2018 # I have not been able to find exact dates for the transition in November
2019 # yet. By reading this article it seems like Fiji will be 14 hours ahead
2020 # of UTC as well, but as far as I know Fiji will only be 13 hours ahead
2021 # (12 + 1 hour DST).
2022 
2023 # From Arthur David Olson (1999-09-20):
2024 # According to &lt;http://www.tongaonline.com/news/sept1799.html&gt;:
2025 # &quot;Daylight Savings Time will take effect on Oct. 2 through April 15, 2000
2026 # and annually thereafter from the first Saturday in October through the
2027 # third Saturday of April.  Under the system approved by Privy Council on
2028 # Sept. 10, clocks must be turned ahead one hour on the opening day and
2029 # set back an hour on the closing date.&quot;
2030 # Alas, no indication of the time of day.
2031 
2032 # From Rives McDow (1999-10-06):
2033 # Tonga started its Daylight Saving on Saturday morning October 2nd at 0200am.
2034 # Daylight Saving ends on April 16 at 0300am which is Sunday morning.
2035 
2036 # From Steffen Thorsen (2000-10-31):
2037 # Back in March I found a notice on the website http://www.tongaonline.com
2038 # that Tonga changed back to standard time one month early, on March 19
2039 # instead of the original reported date April 16. Unfortunately, the article
2040 # is no longer available on the site, and I did not make a copy of the
2041 # text, and I have forgotten to report it here.

2046 
2047 # From Sione Moala-Mafi (2001-09-20) via Rives McDow:
2048 # At 2:00am on the first Sunday of November, the standard time in the Kingdom
2049 # shall be moved forward by one hour to 3:00am.  At 2:00am on the last Sunday
2050 # of January the standard time in the Kingdom shall be moved backward by one
2051 # hour to 1:00am.

2059 # the cabinet decision, but it appears we are following Fiji&#39;s rule set.
2060 #
2061 # From Tim Parenti (2016-10-26):
2062 # Assume Tonga will observe DST from the first Sunday in November at 02:00

2064 
2065 # From David Wade (2017-10-18):
2066 # In August government was disolved by the King.  The current prime minister

2076 # From Vernice Anderson, Personal Secretary to Philip Jessup,

2078 #
2079 # Saturday, the 14th [of October, 1950] - ...  The time was all the
2080 # more confusing at that point, because we had crossed the
2081 # International Date Line, thus getting two Sundays.  Furthermore, we
2082 # discovered that Wake Island had two hours of daylight saving time
2083 # making calculation of time in Washington difficult if not almost
2084 # impossible.

2096 # The International Date Line
2097 
2098 # From Gwillim Law (2000-01-03):
2099 #
2100 # The International Date Line is not defined by any international standard,
2101 # convention, or treaty.  Mapmakers are free to draw it as they please.
2102 # Reputable mapmakers will simply ensure that every point of land appears on
2103 # the correct side of the IDL, according to the date legally observed there.
2104 #
2105 # When Kiribati adopted a uniform date in 1995, thereby moving the Phoenix and
2106 # Line Islands to the west side of the IDL (or, if you prefer, moving the IDL
2107 # to the east side of the Phoenix and Line Islands), I suppose that most
2108 # mapmakers redrew the IDL following the boundary of Kiribati.  Even that line
2109 # has a rather arbitrary nature.  The straight-line boundaries between Pacific
2110 # island nations that are shown on many maps are based on an international
2111 # convention, but are not legally binding national borders.... The date is
2112 # governed by the IDL; therefore, even on the high seas, there may be some
2113 # places as late as fourteen hours later than UTC.  And, since the IDL is not
2114 # an international standard, there are some places on the high seas where the
2115 # correct date is ambiguous.
2116 
2117 # From Wikipedia &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone&gt; (2005-08-31):
2118 # Before 1920, all ships kept local apparent time on the high seas by setting
2119 # their clocks at night or at the morning sight so that, given the ship&#39;s
2120 # speed and direction, it would be 12 o&#39;clock when the Sun crossed the ship&#39;s
2121 # meridian (12 o&#39;clock = local apparent noon).  During 1917, at the
2122 # Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea, it was recommended that all
2123 # ships, both military and civilian, should adopt hourly standard time zones
2124 # on the high seas.  Whenever a ship was within the territorial waters of any
2125 # nation it would use that nation&#39;s standard time.  The captain was permitted
2126 # to change his ship&#39;s clocks at a time of his choice following his ship&#39;s
2127 # entry into another zone time - he often chose midnight.  These zones were
2128 # adopted by all major fleets between 1920 and 1925 but not by many
2129 # independent merchant ships until World War II.

2134 # The American Practical Navigator (2002)
2135 # http://pollux.nss.nima.mil/pubs/pubs_j_apn_sections.html?rid=187
2136 # talks only about the 180-degree meridian with respect to ships in
2137 # international waters; it ignores the international date line.
