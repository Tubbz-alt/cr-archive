  36 # Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
  37 # Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
  38 # San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
  39 # Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
  40 #
  41 # Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
  42 # for time zone data was the International Air Transport
  43 # Association&#39;s Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
  44 # published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
  45 # of the IATA&#39;s data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
  46 # IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
  47 #
  48 # Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
  49 # Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
  50 # I found in the UCLA library.
  51 #
  52 # For data circa 1899, a common source is:

 118 # in spring 1991, then to 4:00 with no DST in fall 1995, then
 119 # readopting Russian DST in 1997.  Go with Shanks &amp; Pottenger, even
 120 # when they disagree with others.  Edgar Der-Danieliantz
 121 # reported (1996-05-04) that Yerevan probably wouldn&#39;t use DST

 389 # From Anthony Fok (2001-12-20):
 390 # BTW, I did some research on-line and found some info regarding these five
 391 # historic timezones from some Taiwan websites.  And yes, there are official
 392 # Chinese names for these locales (before 1949).
 393 #
 394 # From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2006-07-14):
 395 # I have investigated the timezones around 1970 on the
 396 # https://www.astro.com/atlas site [with provinces and county
 397 # boundaries summarized below]....  A few other exceptions were two
 398 # counties on the Sichuan side of the Xizang-Sichuan border,
 399 # counties Dege and Baiyu which lies on the Sichuan side and are
 400 # therefore supposed to be GMT+7, Xizang region being GMT+6, but Dege
 401 # county is GMT+8 according to astro.com while Baiyu county is GMT+6
 402 # (could be true), for the moment I am assuming that those two
 403 # counties are mistakes in the astro.com data.

 414 # It gives evidence that at the beginning of the PRC, Beijing time was
 415 # officially apparent solar time!  However, Guo also says that the
 416 # evidence is dubious, as the relevant institute of astronomy had not
 417 # been taken over by the PRC yet.  It&#39;s plausible that apparent solar
 418 # time was announced but never implemented, and that people continued
 419 # to use UT+8.  As the Shanghai radio station (and I presume the
 420 # observatory) was still under control of French missionaries, it
 421 # could well have ignored any such mandate.
 422 #
 423 # (2)
 424 # Guo Qing-sheng (Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory, CAS, Xi&#39;an 710600, China)
 425 # A Study on the Standard Time Changes for the Past 100 Years in China
 426 # [undated and unknown publication location]
 427 # It says several things:
 428 #   * The Qing dynasty used local apparent solar time throughout China.
 429 #   * The Republic of China instituted Beijing mean solar time effective
 430 #     the official calendar book of 1914.
 431 #   * The French Concession in Shanghai set up signal stations in
 432 #     French docks in the 1890s, controlled by Xujiahui (Zikawei)
 433 #     Observatory and set to local mean time.
 434 #   * &quot;From the end of the 19th century&quot; it changed to UT+8.
 435 #   * Chinese Customs (by then reduced to a tool of foreign powers)
 436 #     eventually standardized on this time for all ports, and it
 437 #     became used by railways as well.
 438 #   * In 1918 the Central Observatory proposed dividing China into
 439 #     five time zones (see below for details).  This caught on
 440 #     at first only in coastal areas observing UT+8.
 441 #   * During WWII all of China was in theory was at UT+7.  In practice
 442 #     this was ignored in the west, and I presume was ignored in
 443 #     Japanese-occupied territory.
 444 #   * Japanese-occupied Manchuria was at UT+9, i.e., Japan time.
 445 #   * The five-zone plan was resurrected after WWII and officially put into
 446 #     place (with some modifications) in March 1948.  It&#39;s not clear
 447 #     how well it was observed in areas under Nationalist control.
 448 #   * The People&#39;s Liberation Army used UT+8 during the civil war.
 449 #
 450 # An AP article &quot;Shanghai Internat&#39;l Area Little Changed&quot; in the
 451 # Lewiston (ME) Daily Sun (1939-05-29), p 17, said &quot;Even the time is
 452 # different - the occupied districts going by Tokyo time, an hour
 453 # ahead of that prevailing in the rest of Shanghai.&quot;  Guess that the
 454 # Xujiahui Observatory was under French control and stuck with UT +08.
 455 #
 456 # In earlier versions of this file, China had many separate Zone entries, but
 457 # this was based on what were apparently incorrect data in Shanks &amp; Pottenger.
 458 # This has now been simplified to the two entries Asia/Shanghai and
 459 # Asia/Urumqi, with the others being links for backward compatibility.
 460 # Proposed in 1918 and theoretically in effect until 1949 (although in practice
 461 # mainly observed in coastal areas), the five zones were:
 462 #
 463 # Changbai Time (&quot;Long-white Time&quot;, Long-white = Heilongjiang area) UT +08:30
 464 # Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here.
 465 # Heilongjiang (except Mohe county), Jilin
 466 #
 467 # Zhongyuan Time (&quot;Central plain Time&quot;) UT +08
 468 # Now part of Asia/Shanghai.
 469 # most of China
 470 # Milne gives 8:05:43.2 for Xujiahui Observatory time; round to nearest.
 471 # Guo says Shanghai switched to UT +08 &quot;from the end of the 19th century&quot;.
 472 #
 473 # Long-shu Time (probably as Long and Shu were two names of the area) UT +07
 474 # Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here.
 475 # Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Ningxia, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Yunnan;
 476 # most of Gansu; west Inner Mongolia; east Qinghai; and the Guangdong
 477 # counties Deqing, Enping, Kaiping, Luoding, Taishan, Xinxing,
 478 # Yangchun, Yangjiang, Yu&#39;nan, and Yunfu.
 479 #
 480 # Xin-zang Time (&quot;Xinjiang-Tibet Time&quot;) UT +06
 481 # This region is now part of either Asia/Urumqi or Asia/Shanghai with
 482 # current boundaries uncertain; times before 1970 for areas that
 483 # disagree with Ürümqi or Shanghai are not recorded here.

 499 
 500 # From Luther Ma (2009-10-17):
 501 # Almost all (&gt;99.9%) ethnic Chinese (properly ethnic Han) living in
 502 # Xinjiang use Chinese Standard Time. Some are aware of Xinjiang time,
 503 # but have no need of it. All planes, trains, and schools function on
 504 # what is called &quot;Beijing time.&quot; When Han make an appointment in Chinese
 505 # they implicitly use Beijing time.
 506 #
 507 # On the other hand, ethnic Uyghurs, who make up about half the
 508 # population of Xinjiang, typically use &quot;Xinjiang time&quot; which is two
 509 # hours behind Beijing time, or UT +06. The government of the Xinjiang
 510 # Uyghur Autonomous Region, (XAUR, or just Xinjiang for short) as well as
 511 # local governments such as the Ürümqi city government use both times in
 512 # publications, referring to what is popularly called Xinjiang time as
 513 # &quot;Ürümqi time.&quot; When Uyghurs make an appointment in the Uyghur language
 514 # they almost invariably use Xinjiang time.
 515 #
 516 # (Their ethnic Han compatriots would typically have no clue of its
 517 # widespread use, however, because so extremely few of them are fluent in
 518 # Uyghur, comparable to the number of Anglo-Americans fluent in Navajo.)
 519 #
 520 # (...As with the rest of China there was a brief interval ending in 1990
 521 # or 1991 when summer time was in use.  The confusion was severe, with
 522 # the province not having dual times but four times in use at the same
 523 # time. Some areas remained on standard Xinjiang time or Beijing time and
 524 # others moving their clocks ahead.)
 525 
 526 # From Luther Ma (2009-11-19):
 527 # With the risk of being redundant to previous answers these are the most common
 528 # English &quot;transliterations&quot; (w/o using non-English symbols):
 529 #
 530 # 1. Wulumuqi...
 531 # 2. Kashi...
 532 # 3. Urumqi...
 533 # 4. Kashgar...
 534 # ...
 535 # 5. It seems that Uyghurs in Ürümqi has been using Xinjiang since at least the
 536 # 1960&#39;s. I know of one Han, now over 50, who grew up in the surrounding
 537 # countryside and used Xinjiang time as a child.
 538 #
 539 # 6. Likewise for Kashgar and the rest of south Xinjiang I don&#39;t know of any
 540 # start date for Xinjiang time.
 541 #
 542 # Without having access to local historical records, nor the ability to legally
 543 # publish them, I would go with October 1, 1949, when Xinjiang became the Uyghur
 544 # Autonomous Region under the PRC. (Before that Uyghurs, of course, would also
 545 # not be using Beijing time, but some local time.)
 546 
 547 # From David Cochrane (2014-03-26):
 548 # Just a confirmation that Ürümqi time was implemented in Ürümqi on 1 Feb 1986:
 549 # https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960684,00.html
 550 
 551 # From Luther Ma (2014-04-22):
 552 # I have interviewed numerous people of various nationalities and from
 553 # different localities in Xinjiang and can confirm the information in Guo&#39;s
 554 # report regarding Xinjiang, as well as the Time article reference by David
 555 # Cochrane.  Whether officially recognized or not (and both are officially
 556 # recognized), two separate times have been in use in Xinjiang since at least
 557 # the Cultural Revolution: Xinjiang Time (XJT), aka Ürümqi Time or local time;
 558 # and Beijing Time.  There is no confusion in Xinjiang as to which name refers
 559 # to which time. Both are widely used in the province, although in some
 560 # population groups might be use one to the exclusion of the other.  The only
 561 # problem is that computers and smart phones list Ürümqi (or Kashgar) as
 562 # having the same time as Beijing.
 563 
 564 # From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 565 # In the early days of the PRC, Tibet was given its own time zone (UT +06)
 566 # but this was withdrawn in 1959 and never reinstated; see Tubten Khétsun,
 567 # Memories of life in Lhasa under Chinese Rule, Columbia U Press, ISBN
 568 # 978-0231142861 (2008), translator&#39;s introduction by Matthew Akester, p x.
 569 # As this is before our 1970 cutoff, Tibet doesn&#39;t need a separate zone.
 570 #
 571 # Xinjiang Time is well-documented as being officially recognized.  E.g., see
 572 # &quot;The Working-Calendar for The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government&quot;
 573 # &lt;http://www.sinkiang.gov.cn/service/ourworking/&gt; (2014-04-22).
 574 # Unfortunately, we have no good records of time in Xinjiang before 1986.
 575 # During the 20th century parts of Xinjiang were ruled by the Qing dynasty,
 576 # the Republic of China, various warlords, the First and Second East Turkestan
 577 # Republics, the Soviet Union, the Kuomintang, and the People&#39;s Republic of
 578 # China, and tracking down all these organizations&#39; timekeeping rules would be
 579 # quite a trick.  Approximate this lost history by a transition from LMT to
 580 # UT +06 at the start of 1928, the year of accession of the warlord Jin Shuren,
 581 # which happens to be the date given by Shanks &amp; Pottenger (no doubt as a
 582 # guess) as the transition from LMT.  Ignore the usage of +08 before
 583 # 1986-02-01 under the theory that the transition date to +08 is unknown and
 584 # that the sort of users who prefer Asia/Urumqi now typically ignored the
 585 # +08 mandate back then.

 795 # Taiwan
 796 
 797 # From smallufo (2010-04-03):
 798 # According to Taiwan&#39;s CWB [Central Weather Bureau],
 799 # http://www.cwb.gov.tw/V6/astronomy/cdata/summert.htm
 800 # Taipei has DST in 1979 between July 1st and Sep 30.
 801 
 802 # From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2013-07-12):
 803 # On Dec 28, 1895, the Meiji Emperor announced Ordinance No. 167 of
 804 # Meiji Year 28 &quot;The clause about standard time&quot;, mentioned that
 805 # Taiwan and Penghu Islands, as well as Yaeyama and Miyako Islands
 806 # (both in Okinawa) adopt the Western Standard Time which is based on
 807 # 120E. The adoption began from Jan 1, 1896. The original text can be
 808 # found on Wikisource:
 809 # https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/標準時ニ關スル件_(公布時)
 810 # ... This could be the first adoption of time zone in Taiwan, because
 811 # during the Qing Dynasty, it seems that there was no time zone
 812 # declared officially.
 813 #
 814 # Later, in the beginning of World War II, on Sep 25, 1937, the Showa
 815 # Emperor announced Ordinance No. 529 of Showa Year 12 &quot;The clause of
 816 # revision in the ordinance No. 167 of Meiji year 28 about standard
 817 # time&quot;, in which abolished the adoption of Western Standard Time in
 818 # western islands (listed above), which means the whole Japan
 819 # territory, including later occupations, adopt Japan Central Time
 820 # (UT+9). The adoption began on Oct 1, 1937. The original text can
 821 # be found on Wikisource:
 822 # https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/明治二十八年勅令第百六十七號標準時ニ關スル件中改正ノ件
 823 #
 824 # That is, the time zone of Taipei switched to UT+9 on Oct 1, 1937.
 825 
 826 # From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
 827 # I&#39;ve found more evidence about when the time zone was switched from UT+9
 828 # back to UT+8 after WW2.  I believe it was on Sep 21, 1945.  In a document
 829 # during Japanese era [1] in which the officer told the staff to change time
 830 # zone back to Western Standard Time (UT+8) on Sep 21.  And in another
 831 # history page of National Cheng Kung University [2], on Sep 21 there is a
 832 # note &quot;from today, switch back to Western Standard Time&quot;.  From these two
 833 # materials, I believe that the time zone change happened on Sep 21.  And
 834 # today I have found another monthly journal called &quot;The Astronomical Herald&quot;
 835 # from The Astronomical Society of Japan [3] in which it mentioned the fact
 836 # that:
 837 #
 838 # 1. Standard Time of the Country (Japan) was adopted on Jan 1, 1888, using
 839 # the time at 135E (GMT+9)
 840 #
 841 # 2. Standard Time of the Country was renamed to Central Standard Time, on Jan
 842 # 1, 1898, and on the same day, the new territories Taiwan and Penghu islands,
 843 # as well as Yaeyama and Miyako islands, adopted a new time zone called
 844 # Western Standard Time, which is in GMT+8.
 845 #
 846 # 3. Western Standard Time was deprecated on Sep 30, 1937. From then all the
 847 # territories of Japan adopted the same time zone, which is Central Standard
 848 # Time.

 857 # Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-03):
 858 # I finally have found the real official gazette about changing back to
 859 # Western Standard Time on Sep 21 in Taiwan.  It&#39;s Taiwan Governor-General
 860 # Bulletin No. 386 in Showa 20 years (1945), published on Sep 19, 1945. [1] ...
 861 # [It] abolishes Bulletin No. 207 in Showa 12 years (1937), which is a local
 862 # bulletin in Taiwan for that Ordinance No. 529. It also mentioned that 1am on
 863 # Sep 21, 1945 will be 12am on Sep 21.  I think this bulletin is much more
 864 # official than the one I mentioned in my first mail, because it&#39;s from the
 865 # top-level government in Taiwan. If you&#39;re going to quote any resource, this
 866 # would be a good one.

 870 # From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
 871 # In 1946, DST in Taiwan was from May 15 and ended on Sep 30. The info from
 872 # Central Weather Bureau website was not correct.
 873 #
 874 # Original Bulletin:

 876 # http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=0350300AKM1B0 (cont.)
 877 #
 878 # In 1947, DST in Taiwan was expanded to Oct 31. There is a backup of that
 879 # telegram announcement from Taiwan Province Government:
 880 #
 881 # http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=0360310AKZ431
 882 #
 883 # Here is a brief translation:
 884 #
 885 #   The Summer Time this year is adopted from midnight Apr 15 until Sep 20
 886 #   midnight. To save (energy?) consumption, we&#39;re expanding Summer Time
 887 #   adoption till Oct 31 midnight.
 888 #
 889 # The Central Weather Bureau website didn&#39;t mention that, however it can
 890 # be found from historical government announcement database.
 891 
 892 # From Paul Eggert (2014-07-03):
 893 # As per Yu-Cheng Chuang, say that Taiwan was at UT +09 from 1937-10-01
 894 # until 1945-09-21 at 01:00, overriding Shanks &amp; Pottenger.
 895 # Likewise, use Yu-Cheng Chuang&#39;s data for DST in Taiwan.

 924 # * LegisMac
 925 #   http://legismac.safp.gov.mo/legismac/descqry/Descqry.jsf?lang=pt
 926 #   A database for searching titles of legal documents of Macau in
 927 #   Chinese and Portuguese.  The term &quot;HORÁRIO DE VERÃO&quot; can be used for

 929 # * Archives of Macao
 930 #   http://www.archives.gov.mo/en/bo/
 931 #   It contains images of old official gazettes.
 932 # * The Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau have a page listing the
 933 #   summer time history.  But it is not complete and has some mistakes.
 934 #   http://www.smg.gov.mo/smg/geophysics/e_t_Summer%20Time.htm
 935 # Macau adopted GMT+8 on 30 Oct 1904 to follow Hong Kong.  Clocks were
 936 # advanced by 25 minutes and 50 seconds.  Which means the LMT used was
 937 # +7:34:10.  As stated in the &quot;Portaria No. 204&quot; dated 21 October 1904
 938 # and published in the Official Gazette on 29 October 1904.

1108 # an hour recently, due to a law proposed by Zurab Murvanidze,
1109 # an MP who went on a hunger strike for 11 days to force discussion about it!
1110 # We have no details, but we&#39;ll guess they didn&#39;t move the clocks back in fall.

1113 # Instead of putting back clocks at the end of October, Georgia
1114 # will stay on daylight savings time this winter to save energy,

1118 #
1119 # Georgia moved closer to Western Europe on Sunday...  The former Soviet
1120 # republic has changed its time zone back to that of Moscow.  As a result it
1121 # is now just four hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time, rather than five hours
1122 # ahead.  The switch was decreed by the pro-Western president of Georgia,
1123 # Mikheil Saakashvili, who said the change was partly prompted by the process

1131 # about it.  As far as I can find, I was told, that there is no document,

1206 # &quot;... in the nineteenth century ... Madras Observatory took its magnetic

1211 # &quot;A more potent cause of resistance to the general adoption of the present
1212 # standard time lies in the fact that it is Madras time.  The citizen of
1213 # Bombay, proud of being &#39;primus in Indis&#39; and of Calcutta, equally proud of
1214 # his city being the Capital of India, and - for a part of the year - the Seat
1215 # of the Supreme Government, alike look down on Madras, and refuse to change
1216 # the time they are using, for that of what they regard as a benighted
1217 # Presidency; while Madras, having for long given the standard time to the
1218 # rest of India, would resist the adoption of any other Indian standard in its
1219 # place.&quot; -- Oldham RD. On Time in India: a suggestion for its improvement.

1231 # This lists +052110 as Madras local time used in railways, and says that on

1237 # appropriate for our purposes, as it was better documented, it is what we do
1238 # elsewhere (e.g., Europe/London before 1880), and after 1906 it was

1266 # time zone maps, I think that must refer to Western Borneo (Kalimantan Barat
1267 # and Kalimantan Tengah) switching from UTC+8 to UTC+7.
1268 #
1269 # From Paul Eggert (2007-03-10):
1270 # Here is another correction to Shanks &amp; Pottenger.
1271 # JohnTWB writes that Japanese forces did not surrender control in
1272 # Indonesia until 1945-09-01 00:00 at the earliest (in Jakarta) and
1273 # other formal surrender ceremonies were September 9, 11, and 13, plus
1274 # September 12 for the regional surrender to Mountbatten in Singapore.
1275 # These would be the earliest possible times for a change.
1276 # Régimes horaires pour le monde entier, by Henri Le Corre, (Éditions
1277 # Traditionnelles, 1987, Paris) says that Java and Madura switched
1278 # from UT +09 to +07:30 on 1945-09-23, and gives 1944-09-01 for Jayapura
1279 # (Hollandia).  For now, assume all Indonesian locations other than Jayapura
1280 # switched on 1945-09-23.
1281 #
1282 # From Paul Eggert (2013-08-11):
1283 # Normally the tz database uses English-language abbreviations, but in
1284 # Indonesia it&#39;s typical to use Indonesian-language abbreviations even
1285 # when writing in English.  For example, see the English-language
1286 # summary published by the Time and Frequency Laboratory of the
1287 # Research Center for Calibration, Instrumentation and Metrology,
1288 # Indonesia, &lt;http://time.kim.lipi.go.id/time-eng.php&gt; (2006-09-29).
1289 # The time zone abbreviations and UT offsets are:

1332 # From Roozbeh Pournader (2003-03-15):
1333 # This is an English translation of what I just found (originally in Persian).
1334 # The Gregorian dates in brackets are mine:
1335 #
1336 #	Official Newspaper No. 13548-1370/6/25 [1991-09-16]

1338 #
1339 #	The Rule About Change of the Official Time of the Country
1340 #
1341 #	The Board of Ministers, in the meeting dated 1370/5/23 [1991-08-14],
1342 #	based on the suggestion number 2221/D dated 1370/4/22 [1991-07-13]
1343 #	of the Country&#39;s Organization for Official and Employment Affairs,
1344 #	and referring to the law for equating the working hours of workers
1345 #	and officers in the whole country dated 1359/4/23 [1980-07-14], and
1346 #	for synchronizing the official times of the country, agreed that:
1347 #
1348 #	The official time of the country will should move forward one hour
1349 #	at the 24[:00] hours of the first day of Farvardin and should return
1350 #	to its previous state at the 24[:00] hours of the 30th day of
1351 #	Shahrivar.
1352 #
1353 #	First Deputy to the President - Hassan Habibi
1354 #
1355 # From personal experience, that agrees with what has been followed
1356 # for at least the last 5 years.  Before that, for a few years, the
1357 # date used was the first Thursday night of Farvardin and the last
1358 # Thursday night of Shahrivar, but I can&#39;t give exact dates....
1359 #
1360 # From Roozbeh Pournader (2005-04-05):
1361 # The text of the Iranian law, in effect since 1925, clearly mentions
1362 # that the true solar year is the measure, and there is no arithmetic
1363 # leap year calculation involved.  There has never been any serious
1364 # plan to change that law....

1426 # From Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-03-30), writing about future
1427 # discrepancies between cal-persia and the Iranian calendar:
1428 # For 2091 solar-longitude-after yields 2091-03-20 08:40:07.7 UT for
1429 # the vernal equinox and that gets so close to 12:00 some local
1430 # Iranian time that the definition of the correct location needs to be
1431 # known exactly, amongst other factors.  2157 is even closer:
1432 # 2157-03-20 08:37:15.5 UT.  But the Gregorian year 2025 should give
1433 # no interpretation problem whatsoever.  By the way, another instant
1434 # in the near future where there will be a discrepancy between
1435 # arithmetical and astronomical Iranian calendars will be in 2058:
1436 # vernal equinox on 2058-03-20 09:03:05.9 UT.  The Java version of
1437 # Reingold&#39;s/Dershowitz&#39; calculator gives correctly the Gregorian date
1438 # 2058-03-21 for 1 Farvardin 1437 (astronomical).

1578 # An article in this week&#39;s Economist (&quot;Inside the Saddam-free zone&quot;, p. 50 in
1579 # the U.S. edition) on the Iraqi Kurds contains a paragraph:
1580 # &quot;The three northern provinces ... switched their clocks this spring and
1581 # are an hour ahead of Baghdad.&quot;
1582 #
1583 # But Rives McDow (2000-06-18) quotes a contact in Iraqi-Kurdistan as follows:
1584 # In the past, some Kurdish nationalists, as a protest to the Iraqi
1585 # Government, did not adhere to daylight saving time.  They referred
1586 # to daylight saving as Saddam time.  But, as of today, the time zone
1587 # in Iraqi-Kurdistan is on standard time with Baghdad, Iraq.
1588 #
1589 # So we&#39;ll ignore the Economist&#39;s claim.

1623 # From Ephraim Silverberg (2001-01-11):
1624 #
1625 # I coined &quot;IST/IDT&quot; circa 1988.  Until then there were three
1626 # different abbreviations in use:
1627 #
1628 # JST  Jerusalem Standard Time [Danny Braniss, Hebrew University]
1629 # IZT  Israel Zonal (sic) Time [Prof. Haim Papo, Technion]
1630 # EEST Eastern Europe Standard Time [used by almost everyone else]
1631 #
1632 # Since timezones should be called by country and not capital cities,
1633 # I ruled out JST.  As Israel is in Asia Minor and not Eastern Europe,
1634 # EEST was equally unacceptable.  Since &quot;zonal&quot; was not compatible with
1635 # any other timezone abbreviation, I felt that &#39;IST&#39; was the way to go
1636 # and, indeed, it has received almost universal acceptance in timezone
1637 # settings in Israeli computers.
1638 #
1639 # In any case, I am happy to share timezone abbreviations with India,
1640 # high on my favorite-country list (and not only because my wife&#39;s
1641 # family is from India).

1709 # From Ephraim Silverberg
1710 # (1997-03-04, 1998-03-16, 1998-12-28, 2000-01-17, 2000-07-25, 2004-12-22,
1711 # and 2005-02-17):
1712 
1713 # According to the Office of the Secretary General of the Ministry of
1714 # Interior, there is NO set rule for Daylight-Savings/Standard time changes.
1715 # One thing is entrenched in law, however: that there must be at least 150
1716 # days of daylight savings time annually.  From 1993-1998, the change to
1717 # daylight savings time was on a Friday morning from midnight IST to
1718 # 1 a.m IDT; up until 1998, the change back to standard time was on a
1719 # Saturday night from midnight daylight savings time to 11 p.m. standard
1720 # time.  1996 is an exception to this rule where the change back to standard
1721 # time took place on Sunday night instead of Saturday night to avoid
1722 # conflicts with the Jewish New Year.  In 1999, the change to
1723 # daylight savings time was still on a Friday morning but from
1724 # 2 a.m. IST to 3 a.m. IDT; furthermore, the change back to standard time
1725 # was also on a Friday morning from 2 a.m. IDT to 1 a.m. IST for
1726 # 1999 only.  In the year 2000, the change to daylight savings time was
1727 # similar to 1999, but although the change back will be on a Friday, it
1728 # will take place from 1 a.m. IDT to midnight IST.  Starting in 2001, all
1729 # changes to/from will take place at 1 a.m. old time, but now there is no
1730 # rule as to what day of the week it will take place in as the start date
1731 # (except in 2003) is the night after the Passover Seder (i.e. the eve
1732 # of the 16th of Nisan in the lunar Hebrew calendar) and the end date
1733 # (except in 2002) is three nights before Yom Kippur [Day of Atonement]
1734 # (the eve of the 7th of Tishrei in the lunar Hebrew calendar).

1855 # Today&#39;s _Asahi Evening News_ (page 4) reports that Japan had
1856 # daylight saving between 1948 and 1951, but &quot;the system was discontinued
1857 # because the public believed it would lead to longer working hours.&quot;
1858 
1859 # From Mayumi Negishi in the 2005-08-10 Japan Times:
1860 # http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20050810f2.htm
1861 # Occupation authorities imposed daylight-saving time on Japan on
1862 # [1948-05-01]....  But lack of prior debate and the execution of
1863 # daylight-saving time just three days after the bill was passed generated
1864 # deep hatred of the concept....  The Diet unceremoniously passed a bill to
1865 # dump the unpopular system in October 1951, less than a month after the San
1866 # Francisco Peace Treaty was signed.  (A government poll in 1951 showed 53%
1867 # of the Japanese wanted to scrap daylight-saving time, as opposed to 30% who
1868 # wanted to keep it.)

1880 # ... mentioned that using Showa 23 (year 1948) as example, 13pm of September
1881 # 11 in summer time will equal to 0am of September 12 in standard time.
1882 # It cited a document issued by the Liaison Office which briefly existed

2052 # two time zones, and difference between them is one hour.  The zone
2053 # closer to UTC is the former Western zone (probably still called the
2054 # same), encompassing four provinces in the west: Aqtöbe, Atyraū,
2055 # Mangghystaū, and West Kazakhstan.  The other zone encompasses
2056 # everything else....  I guess that would make Kazakhstan time zones

2115 # on the whole territory of Kazakhstan 1 hour forward on 1992-01-19 at
2116 # 2:00, specified DST rules.  It acknowledged that Kazakhstan was
2117 # located in the fourth and the fifth time belts and specified the
2118 # border between them to be located east of Qostanay and Aktyubinsk
2119 # oblasts (notably including Turgai and Qyzylorda oblasts into the fifth
2120 # time belt).

2403 # The Korean Wikipedia entry gives the following sources for UT offsets:
2404 #
2405 # 1908: Official Journal Article No. 3994 (decree No. 5)
2406 # 1912: Governor-General of Korea Official Gazette Issue No. 367
2407 #       (Announcement No. 338)
2408 # 1954: Presidential Decree No. 876 (1954-03-17)

2410 #
2411 # (Another source &quot;1987: Law No. 3919 (1986-12-31)&quot; was in the 2014-10-30
2412 # edition of the Korean Wikipedia entry.)
2413 #
2414 # I guessed that time zone abbreviations through 1945 followed the same
2415 # rules as discussed under Taiwan, with nominal switches from JST to KST
2416 # when the respective cities were taken over by the Allies after WWII.
2417 #
2418 # For Pyongyang, guess no changes from World War II until 2015, as we
2419 # have no information otherwise.
2420 
2421 # From Steffen Thorsen (2015-08-07):
2422 # According to many news sources, North Korea is going to change to
2423 # the 8:30 time zone on August 15, one example:
2424 # http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33815049
2425 #

2430 # There is no common English-language abbreviation for this time zone.
2431 # Use KST, as that&#39;s what we already use for 1954-1961 in ROK.
2432 
2433 # From Kang Seonghoon (2018-04-29):
2434 # North Korea will revert its time zone from UTC+8:30 (PYT; Pyongyang
2435 # Time) back to UTC+9 (KST; Korea Standard Time).

2543 
2544 # From Oscar van Vlijmen (1999-12-11):
2545 # General Information Mongolia
2546 # &lt;http://www.mongoliatourism.gov.mn/general.htm&gt; (1999-09)
2547 # &quot;Time: Mongolia has two time zones. Three westernmost provinces of
2548 # Bayan-Ölgii, Uvs, and Hovd are one hour earlier than the capital city, and
2549 # the rest of the country follows the Ulaanbaatar time, which is UTC/GMT plus
2550 # eight hours.&quot;
2551 
2552 # From Rives McDow (1999-12-13):
2553 # Mongolia discontinued the use of daylight savings time in 1999; 1998
2554 # being the last year it was implemented.  The dates of implementation I am
2555 # unsure of, but most probably it was similar to Russia, except for the time
2556 # of implementation may have been different....
2557 # Some maps in the past have indicated that there was an additional time
2558 # zone in the eastern part of Mongolia, including the provinces of Dornod,
2559 # Sükhbaatar, and possibly Khentii.
2560 
2561 # From Paul Eggert (1999-12-15):
2562 # Naming and spelling is tricky in Mongolia.
2563 # We&#39;ll use Hovd (also spelled Chovd and Khovd) to represent the west zone;
2564 # the capital of the Hovd province is sometimes called Hovd, sometimes Dund-Us,
2565 # and sometimes Jirgalanta (with variant spellings), but the name Hovd
2566 # is good enough for our purposes.
2567 
2568 # From Rives McDow (2001-05-13):
2569 # In addition to Mongolia starting daylight savings as reported earlier
2570 # (adopted DST on 2001-04-27 02:00 local time, ending 2001-09-28),

2577 #
2578 # [The province of Selenge is omitted from the above lists.]
2579 
2580 # From Ganbold Ts., Ulaanbaatar (2004-04-17):
2581 # Daylight saving occurs at 02:00 local time last Saturday of March.
2582 # It will change back to normal at 02:00 local time last Saturday of

2589 # From Paul Eggert (2005-07-26):
2590 # We have wildly conflicting information about Mongolia&#39;s time zones.
2591 # Bill Bonnet (2005-05-19) reports that the US Embassy in Ulaanbaatar says

2629 # There it appears that flights between Choibalsan and Ulaanbaatar arrive
2630 # about 1:35 - 1:50 hours later in local clock time, no matter the
2631 # direction, while Ulaanbaatar-Khovd takes 2 hours in the Eastern
2632 # direction and 3:35 back, which indicates that Ulaanbaatar and Khovd are
2633 # in different time zones (like we know about), while Choibalsan and
2634 # Ulaanbaatar are in the same time zone (correction needed).
2635 
2636 # From Arthur David Olson (2008-05-19):

2705 # I have been advised that Pakistan has decided to adopt dst on a
2706 # TRIAL basis for one year, starting 00:01 local time on April 7, 2002
2707 # and ending at 00:01 local time October 6, 2002.  This is what I was
2708 # told, but I believe that the actual time of change may be 00:00; the
2709 # 00:01 was to make it clear which day it was on.

2717 # 15th October each year&quot;.  This agrees with McDow&#39;s 04-07 at 00:00,

2719 # it&#39;s not on a trial basis.  Also, the &quot;between the first Saturday

2852 # Palestine
2853 
2854 # From Amos Shapir (1998-02-15):
2855 #
2856 # From 1917 until 1948-05-15, all of Palestine, including the parts now
2857 # known as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, was under British rule.
2858 # Therefore the rules given for Israel for that period, apply there too...
2859 #
2860 # The Gaza Strip was under Egyptian rule between 1948-05-15 until 1967-06-05
2861 # (except a short occupation by Israel from 1956-11 till 1957-03, but no
2862 # time zone was affected then).  It was never formally annexed to Egypt,
2863 # though.
2864 #
2865 # The rest of Palestine was under Jordanian rule at that time, formally
2866 # annexed in 1950 as the West Bank (and the word &quot;Trans&quot; was dropped from
2867 # the country&#39;s previous name of &quot;the Hashemite Kingdom of the
2868 # Trans-Jordan&quot;).  So the rules for Jordan for that time apply.  Major
2869 # towns in that area are Nablus (Shchem), El-Halil (Hebron), Ramallah, and
2870 # East Jerusalem.
2871 #
2872 # Both areas were occupied by Israel in June 1967, but not annexed (except
2873 # for East Jerusalem).  They were on Israel time since then; there might
2874 # have been a Military Governor&#39;s order about time zones, but I&#39;m not aware
2875 # of any (such orders may have been issued semi-annually whenever summer
2876 # time was in effect, but maybe the legal aspect of time was just neglected).
2877 #
2878 # The Palestinian Authority was established in 1993, and got hold of most
2879 # towns in the West Bank and Gaza by 1995.  I know that in order to
2880 # demonstrate...independence, they have been switching to
2881 # summer time and back on a different schedule than Israel&#39;s, but I don&#39;t
2882 # know when this was started, or what algorithm is used (most likely the
2883 # Jordanian one).
2884 #
2885 # To summarize, the table should probably look something like that:
2886 #
2887 # Area \ when | 1918-1947 | 1948-1967 | 1967-1995 | 1996-
2888 # ------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------
2889 # Israel      | Zion      | Zion      | Zion      | Zion
2890 # West bank   | Zion      | Jordan    | Zion      | Jordan
2891 # Gaza        | Zion      | Egypt     | Zion      | Jordan
2892 #
2893 # I guess more info may be available from the PA&#39;s web page (if/when they
2894 # have one).
2895 
2896 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
2897 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger write that Gaza did not observe DST until 1957, but go
2898 # with Shapir and assume that it observed DST from 1940 through 1947,
2899 # and that it used Jordanian rules starting in 1996.
2900 # We don&#39;t yet need a separate entry for the West Bank, since
2901 # the only differences between it and Gaza that we know about
2902 # occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
2903 # However, as we get more information, we may need to add entries
2904 # for parts of the West Bank as they transitioned from Israel&#39;s rules
2905 # to Palestine&#39;s rules.
2906 
2907 # From IINS News Service - Israel - 1998-03-23 10:38:07 Israel time,

2910 # Despite the fact that Israel changed over to daylight savings time
2911 # last week, the PLO Authority (PA) has decided not to turn its clocks
2912 # one-hour forward at this time.  As a sign of independence from Israeli rule,
2913 # the PA has decided to implement DST in April.

3048 # &quot;...Earlier this month, the Palestinian government in the West Bank decided to
3049 # move to standard time for 30 days, during Ramadan. The Palestinians in the
3050 # Gaza Strip accepted the change and also moved their clocks one hour back.
3051 # The Hamas government said on Saturday that it won&#39;t observe summertime after
3052 # the Muslim feast of Id al-Fitr, which begins on Tuesday...&quot;

3268 # Saudi Arabia
3269 #
3270 # From Paul Eggert (2018-08-29):
3271 # Time in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian peninsula was not
3272 # standardized until 1968 or so; we don&#39;t know exactly when, and possibly it
3273 # has never been made official.  Richard P Hunt, in &quot;Islam city yielding to
3274 # modern times&quot;, New York Times (1961-04-09), p 20, wrote that only airlines
3275 # observed standard time, and that people in Jeddah mostly observed quasi-solar
3276 # time, doing so by setting their watches at sunrise to 6 o&#39;clock (or to 12
3277 # o&#39;clock for &quot;Arab&quot; time).
3278 #
3279 # Timekeeping differed depending on who you were and which part of Saudi
3280 # Arabia you were in.  In 1969, Elias Antar wrote that although a common
3281 # practice had been to set one&#39;s watch to 12:00 (i.e., midnight) at sunset -
3282 # which meant that the time on one side of a mountain could differ greatly from
3283 # the time on the other side - many foreigners set their watches to 6pm
3284 # instead, while airlines instead used UTC +03 (except in Dhahran, where they
3285 # used UTC +04), Aramco used UTC +03 with DST, and the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line
3286 # Company used Aramco time in eastern Saudi Arabia and airline time in western.
3287 # (The American Military Aid Advisory Group used plain UTC.)  Antar writes,
3288 # &quot;A man named Higgins, so the story goes, used to run a local power
3289 # station. One day, the whole thing became too much for Higgins and he
3290 # assembled his staff and laid down the law. &#39;I&#39;ve had enough of this,&#39; he
3291 # shrieked. &#39;It is now 12 o&#39;clock Higgins Time, and from now on this station is
3292 # going to run on Higgins Time.&#39; And so, until last year, it did.&quot;  See:

3297 #
3298 # The TZ database cannot represent quasi-solar time; airline time is the best
3299 # we can do.  The 1946 foreign air news digest of the U.S. Civil Aeronautics
3300 # Board (OCLC 42299995) reported that the &quot;... Arabian Government, inaugurated
3301 # a weekly Dhahran-Cairo service, via the Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and
3302 # Jidda, on March 14, 1947&quot;.  Shanks &amp; Pottenger guessed 1950; go with the
3303 # earlier date.
3304 #
3305 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger also state that until 1968-05-01 Saudi Arabia had two
3306 # time zones; the other zone, at UT +04, was in the far eastern part of
3307 # the country.  Presumably this is documenting airline time.  Ignore this,
3308 # as it&#39;s before our 1970 cutoff.

3627 # The 1906 transition was effective July 1 and standardized Indochina to
3628 # Phù Liễn Observatory, legally 104° 17&#39; 17&quot; east of Paris.
3629 # It&#39;s unclear whether this meant legal Paris Mean Time (00:09:21) or
3630 # the Paris Meridian (2° 20&#39; 14.03&quot; E); the former yields 07:06:30.1333...
3631 # and the latter 07:06:29.333... so either way it rounds to 07:06:30,
3632 # which is used below even though the modern-day Phù Liễn Observatory
3633 # is closer to 07:06:31.  Abbreviate Phù Liễn Mean Time as PLMT.
