  77 # From Alex Livingston (1996-11-01):
  78 # I have heard or read more than once that some resort islands off the coast
  79 # of Queensland chose to keep observing daylight-saving time even after
  80 # Queensland ceased to.
  81 #
  82 # From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
  83 # IATA SSIM (1993-02/1994-09) say that the Holiday Islands (Hayman, Lindeman,
  84 # Hamilton) observed DST for two years after the rest of Queensland stopped.
  85 # Hamilton is the largest, but there is also a Hamilton in Victoria,
  86 # so use Lindeman.
  87 #
  88 # From J William Piggott (2016-02-20):
  89 # There is no location named Holiday Islands in Queensland Australia; holiday
  90 # islands is a colloquial term used globally.  Hayman and Lindeman are at the
  91 # north and south extremes of the Whitsunday Islands archipelago, and
  92 # Hamilton is in between; it is reasonable to believe that this time zone
  93 # applies to all of the Whitsundays.

 787 # From Lyle McElhaney (2014-03-11):
 788 # [W]hen JI was being used for that [atomic bomb] testing, the time being used
 789 # was not Hawaiian time but rather the same time being used on the ships,
 790 # which had a GMT offset of -11 hours.  This apparently applied to at least the
 791 # time from Operation Newsreel (Hardtack I/Teak shot, 1958-08-01) to the last

 887 # From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 888 # Daylight saving time has long been controversial in Australia, pitting
 889 # region against region, rural against urban, and local against global.
 890 # For example, in her review of Graeme Davison&#39;s _The Unforgiving
 891 # Minute: how Australians learned to tell the time_ (1993), Perth native
 892 # Phillipa J Martyr wrote, &quot;The section entitled &#39;Saving Daylight&#39; was
 893 # very informative, but was (as can, sadly, only be expected from a
 894 # Melbourne-based study) replete with the usual chuckleheaded
 895 # Queenslanders and straw-chewing yokels from the West prattling fables
 896 # about fading curtains and crazed farm animals.&quot;
 897 # Electronic Journal of Australian and New Zealand History (1997-03-03)

 901 # Implementation Dates of Daylight Saving Time within Australia
 902 # http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/dst_times.shtml
 903 # summarizes daylight saving issues in Australia.
 904 
 905 # From Arthur David Olson (2005-12-12):
 906 # Lawlink NSW:Daylight Saving in New South Wales
 907 # http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Corporate/ll_agdinfo.nsf/pages/community_relations_daylight_saving
 908 # covers New South Wales in particular.
 909 
 910 # From John Mackin (1991-03-06):
 911 # We in Australia have _never_ referred to DST as &#39;daylight&#39; time.
 912 # It is called &#39;summer&#39; time.  Now by a happy coincidence, &#39;summer&#39;
 913 # and &#39;standard&#39; happen to start with the same letter; hence, the
 914 # abbreviation does _not_ change...
 915 # The legislation does not actually define abbreviations, at least
 916 # in this State, but the abbreviation is just commonly taken to be the
 917 # initials of the phrase, and the legislation here uniformly uses
 918 # the phrase &#39;summer time&#39; and does not use the phrase &#39;daylight
 919 # time&#39;.
 920 # Announcers on the Commonwealth radio network, the ABC (for Australian
 921 # Broadcasting Commission), use the phrases &#39;Eastern Standard Time&#39;
 922 # or &#39;Eastern Summer Time&#39;.  (Note, though, that as I say in the
 923 # current australasia file, there is really no such thing.)  Announcers
 924 # on its overseas service, Radio Australia, use the same phrases
 925 # prefixed by the word &#39;Australian&#39; when referring to local times;
 926 # time announcements on that service, naturally enough, are made in UTC.
 927 
 928 # From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 929 #
 930 # Inspired by Mackin&#39;s remarks quoted above, earlier versions of this
 931 # file used &quot;EST&quot; for both Eastern Standard Time and Eastern Summer
 932 # Time in Australia, and similarly for &quot;CST&quot;, &quot;CWST&quot;, and &quot;WST&quot;.
 933 # However, these abbreviations were confusing and were not common
 934 # practice among Australians, and there were justifiable complaints
 935 # about them, so I attempted to survey current Australian usage.
 936 # For the tz database, the full English phrase is not that important;
 937 # what matters is the abbreviation.  It&#39;s difficult to survey the web
 938 # directly for abbreviation usage, as there are so many false hits for
 939 # strings like &quot;EST&quot; and &quot;EDT&quot;, so I looked for pages that defined an
 940 # abbreviation for eastern or central DST in Australia, and got the
 941 # following numbers of unique hits for the listed Google queries:
 942 #
 943 #   10 &quot;Eastern Daylight Time AEST&quot; site:au [some are false hits]
 944 #   10 &quot;Eastern Summer Time AEST&quot; site:au
 945 #   10 &quot;Summer Time AEDT&quot; site:au
 946 #   13 &quot;EDST Eastern Daylight Saving Time&quot; site:au
 947 #   18 &quot;Summer Time ESST&quot; site:au
 948 #   28 &quot;Eastern Daylight Saving Time EDST&quot; site:au
 949 #   39 &quot;EDT Eastern Daylight Time&quot; site:au [some are false hits]
 950 #   53 &quot;Eastern Daylight Time EDT&quot; site:au [some are false hits]
 951 #   54 &quot;AEDT Australian Eastern Daylight Time&quot; site:au
 952 #  182 &quot;Eastern Daylight Time AEDT&quot; site:au
 953 #
 954 #   17 &quot;Central Daylight Time CDT&quot; site:au [some are false hits]
 955 #   46 &quot;Central Daylight Time ACDT&quot; site:au
 956 #
 957 # I tried several other variants (e.g., &quot;Eastern Summer Time EST&quot;) but
 958 # they all returned fewer than 10 unique hits.  I also looked for pages
 959 # mentioning both &quot;western standard time&quot; and an abbreviation, since
 960 # there is no WST in the US to generate false hits, and found:
 961 #
 962 #  156 &quot;western standard time&quot; AWST site:au
 963 #  226 &quot;western standard time&quot; WST site:au
 964 #
 965 # I then surveyed the top ten newspapers in Australia by circulation as
 966 # listed in Wikipedia, using Google queries like &quot;AEDT site:heraldsun.com.au&quot;
 967 # and obtaining estimated counts from the initial page of search results.
 968 # All ten papers greatly preferred &quot;AEDT&quot; to &quot;EDT&quot;.  The papers
 969 # surveyed were the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Courier-Mail,
 970 # The Sydney Morning Herald, The West Australian, The Age, The Advertiser,
 971 # The Australian, The Financial Review, and The Herald (Newcastle).
 972 #
 973 # I also searched for historical usage, to see whether abbreviations
 974 # like &quot;AEDT&quot; are new.  A Trove search &lt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/&gt;
 975 # found only one newspaper (The Canberra Times) with a house style
 976 # dating back to the 1970s, I expect because other newspapers weren&#39;t
 977 # fully indexed.  The Canberra Times strongly preferred abbreviations
 978 # like &quot;AEDT&quot;.  The first occurrence of &quot;AEDT&quot; was a World Weather
 979 # column (1971-11-17, page 24), and of &quot;ACDT&quot; was a Scoreboard column

1010 #
1011 #   The Transport Safety Bureau has an extensive series of accident reports,

1013 #   Googling site:atsb.gov.au found the following number of unique hits:
1014 #   311 &quot;ESuT&quot;, 195 &quot;EDT&quot;, 26 &quot;AEDT&quot;, 83 &quot;CSuT&quot;, 46 &quot;CDT&quot;.

1017 #
1018 # From the above it appears that there is a working consensus in
1019 # Australia to use trailing &quot;DT&quot; for daylight saving time; although
1020 # some sources use trailing &quot;SST&quot; or &quot;ST&quot; or &quot;SuT&quot; they are by far in
1021 # the minority.  The case for leading &quot;A&quot; is weaker, but since it
1022 # seems to be preferred in the overall web and is preferred in all
1023 # the leading newspaper websites and in many government departments,
1024 # it has a stronger case than omitting the leading &quot;A&quot;.  The current
1025 # version of the database therefore uses abbreviations like &quot;AEST&quot; and

1310 # Observatories&quot;[1], and in particular the Shrine of Remembrance[2] located
1311 # in Melbourne, Australia.
1312 #
1313 # Apparently the shrine&#39;s main purpose is a beam of sunlight which
1314 # illuminates a special spot on the floor at the 11th hour of the 11th day
1315 # of the 11th month (Remembrance Day) every year in memory of Australia&#39;s
1316 # fallen WWI soldiers.  And if you go there on Nov. 11, at 11am local time,
1317 # you will indeed see the sunbeam illuminate the special spot at the
1318 # expected time.
1319 #
1320 # However, that is only because of some special mirror contraption that had
1321 # to be employed, since due to daylight savings time, the true solar time of

1435 # Lord Howe Island advances clocks by 30 minutes during DST in NSW and retards

1437 # introduced in NSW, the &quot;changeover&quot; time on the Island has been 02:00 as

1695 #
1696 # Until 1941 Tonga maintained a standard time 50 minutes ahead of NZST
1697 # 12 hours and 20 minutes ahead of GMT.  When New Zealand adjusted its
1698 # standard time in 1940s, Tonga had the choice of subtracting from its

1700 # advancing its time to maintain the differential of 13°
1701 # (approximately 50 minutes ahead of New Zealand time).

1703 # Because His Majesty King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV, then Crown Prince
1704 # Tungī, preferred to ensure Tonga&#39;s title as the land where time
1705 # begins, the Legislative Assembly approved the latter change.

1707 # But some of the older, more conservative members from the outer
1708 # islands objected. &quot;If at midnight on Dec. 31, we move ahead 40
1709 # minutes, as your Royal Highness wishes, what becomes of the 40
1710 # minutes we have lost?&quot;
1711 #

1726 # From Steffen Thorsen (1999-09-09):
1727 # * Tonga will introduce DST in November
1728 #
1729 # I was given this link by John Letts:
1730 # http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/asia-pacific/newsid_424000/424764.stm
1731 #
1732 # I have not been able to find exact dates for the transition in November
1733 # yet. By reading this article it seems like Fiji will be 14 hours ahead
1734 # of UTC as well, but as far as I know Fiji will only be 13 hours ahead
1735 # (12 + 1 hour DST).
1736 
1737 # From Arthur David Olson (1999-09-20):
1738 # According to &lt;http://www.tongaonline.com/news/sept1799.html&gt;:
1739 # &quot;Daylight Savings Time will take effect on Oct. 2 through April 15, 2000
1740 # and annually thereafter from the first Saturday in October through the
1741 # third Saturday of April.  Under the system approved by Privy Council on
1742 # Sept. 10, clocks must be turned ahead one hour on the opening day and
1743 # set back an hour on the closing date.&quot;
1744 # Alas, no indication of the time of day.
1745 
1746 # From Rives McDow (1999-10-06):
1747 # Tonga started its Daylight Saving on Saturday morning October 2nd at 0200am.
1748 # Daylight Saving ends on April 16 at 0300am which is Sunday morning.
1749 
1750 # From Steffen Thorsen (2000-10-31):
1751 # Back in March I found a notice on the website http://www.tongaonline.com
1752 # that Tonga changed back to standard time one month early, on March 19
1753 # instead of the original reported date April 16. Unfortunately, the article
1754 # is no longer available on the site, and I did not make a copy of the
1755 # text, and I have forgotten to report it here.
1756 # (Original URL was &lt;http://www.tongaonline.com/news/march162000.htm&gt;)
1757 
1758 # From Rives McDow (2000-12-01):
1759 # Tonga is observing DST as of 2000-11-04 and will stop on 2001-01-27.
1760 
1761 # From Sione Moala-Mafi (2001-09-20) via Rives McDow:
1762 # At 2:00am on the first Sunday of November, the standard time in the Kingdom
1763 # shall be moved forward by one hour to 3:00am.  At 2:00am on the last Sunday
1764 # of January the standard time in the Kingdom shall be moved backward by one
1765 # hour to 1:00am.
1766 
1767 # From Pulu ʻAnau (2002-11-05):
1768 # The law was for 3 years, supposedly to get renewed.  It wasn&#39;t.
1769 
1770 # From Pulu ʻAnau (2016-10-27):
1771 # http://mic.gov.to/news-today/press-releases/6375-daylight-saving-set-to-run-from-6-november-2016-to-15-january-2017
1772 # Cannot find anyone who knows the rules, has seen the duration or has seen
1773 # the cabinet decision, but it appears we are following Fiji&#39;s rule set.
1774 #
1775 # From Tim Parenti (2016-10-26):
1776 # Assume Tonga will observe DST from the first Sunday in November at 02:00
1777 # through the third Sunday in January at 03:00, like Fiji, for now.
1778 
1779 # From David Wade (2017-10-18):
1780 # In August government was disolved by the King.  The current prime minister
1781 # continued in office in care taker mode.  It is easy to see that few
1782 # decisions will be made until elections 16th November.
1783 #
1784 # From Paul Eggert (2017-10-18):
1785 # For now, guess that DST is discontinued.  That&#39;s what the IATA is guessing.

1788 # Wake
1789 
1790 # From Vernice Anderson, Personal Secretary to Philip Jessup,
1791 # US Ambassador At Large (oral history interview, 1971-02-02):
1792 #
1793 # Saturday, the 14th [of October, 1950] - ...  The time was all the
1794 # more confusing at that point, because we had crossed the
1795 # International Date Line, thus getting two Sundays.  Furthermore, we
1796 # discovered that Wake Island had two hours of daylight saving time
1797 # making calculation of time in Washington difficult if not almost
1798 # impossible.

1801 
1802 # From Paul Eggert (2003-03-23):
1803 # We have no other report of DST in Wake Island, so omit this info for now.

1807 # The International Date Line
1808 
1809 # From Gwillim Law (2000-01-03):
1810 #
1811 # The International Date Line is not defined by any international standard,
1812 # convention, or treaty.  Mapmakers are free to draw it as they please.
1813 # Reputable mapmakers will simply ensure that every point of land appears on
1814 # the correct side of the IDL, according to the date legally observed there.
1815 #
1816 # When Kiribati adopted a uniform date in 1995, thereby moving the Phoenix and
1817 # Line Islands to the west side of the IDL (or, if you prefer, moving the IDL
1818 # to the east side of the Phoenix and Line Islands), I suppose that most
1819 # mapmakers redrew the IDL following the boundary of Kiribati.  Even that line
1820 # has a rather arbitrary nature.  The straight-line boundaries between Pacific
1821 # island nations that are shown on many maps are based on an international
1822 # convention, but are not legally binding national borders.... The date is
1823 # governed by the IDL; therefore, even on the high seas, there may be some
1824 # places as late as fourteen hours later than UTC.  And, since the IDL is not
1825 # an international standard, there are some places on the high seas where the
1826 # correct date is ambiguous.
1827 
1828 # From Wikipedia &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone&gt; (2005-08-31):
1829 # Before 1920, all ships kept local apparent time on the high seas by setting
1830 # their clocks at night or at the morning sight so that, given the ship&#39;s
1831 # speed and direction, it would be 12 o&#39;clock when the Sun crossed the ship&#39;s
1832 # meridian (12 o&#39;clock = local apparent noon).  During 1917, at the
1833 # Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea, it was recommended that all
1834 # ships, both military and civilian, should adopt hourly standard time zones
1835 # on the high seas.  Whenever a ship was within the territorial waters of any
1836 # nation it would use that nation&#39;s standard time.  The captain was permitted
1837 # to change his ship&#39;s clocks at a time of his choice following his ship&#39;s
1838 # entry into another zone time - he often chose midnight.  These zones were
1839 # adopted by all major fleets between 1920 and 1925 but not by many
1840 # independent merchant ships until World War II.

1842 # From Paul Eggert, using references suggested by Oscar van Vlijmen
1843 # (2005-03-20):
1844 #
1845 # The American Practical Navigator (2002)
1846 # http://pollux.nss.nima.mil/pubs/pubs_j_apn_sections.html?rid=187
1847 # talks only about the 180-degree meridian with respect to ships in
1848 # international waters; it ignores the international date line.
