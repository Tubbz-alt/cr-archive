  44 # From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
  45 # Howse writes (pp 121-125) that time zones were invented by
  46 # Professor Charles Ferdinand Dowd (1825-1904),
  47 # Principal of Temple Grove Ladies&#39; Seminary (Saratoga Springs, NY).
  48 # His pamphlet &quot;A System of National Time for Railroads&quot; (1870)
  49 # was the result of his proposals at the Convention of Railroad Trunk Lines
  50 # in New York City (1869-10).  His 1870 proposal was based on Washington, DC,
  51 # but in 1872-05 he moved the proposed origin to Greenwich.
  52 
  53 # From Paul Eggert (2018-03-20):
  54 # Dowd&#39;s proposal left many details unresolved, such as where to draw
  55 # lines between time zones.  The key individual who made time zones
  56 # work in the US was William Frederick Allen - railway engineer,
  57 # managing editor of the Travelers&#39; Guide, and secretary of the
  58 # General Time Convention, a railway standardization group.  Allen
  59 # spent months in dialogs with scientific and railway leaders,
  60 # developed a workable plan to institute time zones, and presented it
  61 # to the General Time Convention on 1883-04-11, saying that his plan
  62 # meant &quot;local time would be practically abolished&quot; - a plus for
  63 # railway scheduling.  By the next convention on 1883-10-11 nearly all
  64 # railroads had agreed and it took effect on 1883-11-18.  That Sunday
  65 # was called the &quot;day of two noons&quot;, as some locations observed noon
  66 # twice.  Allen witnessed the transition in New York City, writing:
  67 #
  68 #   I heard the bells of St. Paul&#39;s strike on the old time.  Four
  69 #   minutes later, obedient to the electrical signal from the Naval
  70 #   Observatory ... the time-ball made its rapid descent, the chimes
  71 #   of old Trinity rang twelve measured strokes, and local time was
  72 #   abandoned, probably forever.
  73 #
  74 # Most of the US soon followed suit.  See:
  75 # Bartky IR. The adoption of standard time. Technol Cult 1989 Jan;30(1):25-56.
  76 # https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3105430
  77 
  78 # From Paul Eggert (2005-04-16):
  79 # That 1883 transition occurred at 12:00 new time, not at 12:00 old time.
  80 # See p 46 of David Prerau, Seize the daylight, Thunder&#39;s Mouth Press (2005).
  81 
  82 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
  83 # A good source for time zone historical data in the US is
  84 # Thomas G. Shanks, The American Atlas (5th edition),
  85 # San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
  86 # Make sure you have the errata sheet; the book is somewhat useless without it.
  87 # It is the source for most of the pre-1991 US entries below.
  88 
  89 # From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
  90 # Daylight Saving Time was first suggested as a joke by Benjamin Franklin
  91 # in his whimsical essay &quot;An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost
  92 # of Light&quot; published in the Journal de Paris (1784-04-26).
  93 # Not everyone is happy with the results:
  94 #
  95 #	I don&#39;t really care how time is reckoned so long as there is some
  96 #	agreement about it, but I object to being told that I am saving
  97 #	daylight when my reason tells me that I am doing nothing of the kind.
  98 #	I even object to the implication that I am wasting something
  99 #	valuable if I stay in bed after the sun has risen.  As an admirer
 100 #	of moonlight I resent the bossy insistence of those who want to
 101 #	reduce my time for enjoying it.  At the back of the Daylight Saving
 102 #	scheme I detect the bony, blue-fingered hand of Puritanism, eager
 103 #	to push people into bed earlier, and get them up earlier, to make
 104 #	them healthy, wealthy and wise in spite of themselves.

 111 # (Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, 1927).

 113 #
 114 # Shanks says that DST was called &quot;War Time&quot; in the US in 1918 and 1919.
 115 # However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which
 116 # was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently
 117 # time was just called &quot;Standard Time&quot; or &quot;Daylight Saving Time&quot;.
 118 
 119 # From Arthur David Olson:
 120 # US Daylight Saving Time ended on the last Sunday of *October* in 1974.
 121 # See, for example, the front page of the Saturday, 1974-10-26
 122 # and Sunday, 1974-10-27 editions of the Washington Post.
 123 
 124 # From Arthur David Olson:
 125 # Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
 126 # Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.
 127 
 128 # From Arthur David Olson (2000-09-25):
 129 # Last night I heard part of a rebroadcast of a 1945 Arch Oboler radio drama.
 130 # In the introduction, Oboler spoke of &quot;Eastern Peace Time.&quot;
 131 # An AltaVista search turned up:
 132 # https://web.archive.org/web/20000926032210/http://rowayton.org/rhs/hstaug45.html
 133 # &quot;When the time is announced over the radio now, it is &#39;Eastern Peace
 134 # Time&#39; instead of the old familiar &#39;Eastern War Time.&#39;  Peace is wonderful.&quot;
 135 # (August 1945) by way of confirmation.
 136 #
 137 # From Paul Eggert (2017-09-23):
 138 # This was the V-J Day issue of the Clamdigger, a Rowayton, CT newsletter.
 139 
 140 # From Joseph Gallant citing
 141 # George H. Douglas, _The Early Days of Radio Broadcasting_ (1987):
 142 # At 7 P.M. (Eastern War Time) [on 1945-08-14], the networks were set
 143 # to switch to London for Attlee&#39;s address, but the American people
 144 # never got to hear his speech live. According to one press account,
 145 # CBS&#39; Bob Trout was first to announce the word of Japan&#39;s surrender,
 146 # but a few seconds later, NBC, ABC and Mutual also flashed the word
 147 # of surrender, all of whom interrupting the bells of Big Ben in
 148 # London which were to precede Mr. Attlee&#39;s speech.
 149 
 150 # From Paul Eggert (2003-02-09): It was Robert St John, not Bob Trout.  From
 151 # Myrna Oliver&#39;s obituary of St John on page B16 of today&#39;s Los Angeles Times:
 152 #
 153 # ... a war-weary U.S. clung to radios, awaiting word of Japan&#39;s surrender.
 154 # Any announcement from Asia would reach St. John&#39;s New York newsroom on a
 155 # wire service teletype machine, which had prescribed signals for major news.
 156 # Associated Press, for example, would ring five bells before spewing out
 157 # typed copy of an important story, and 10 bells for news &quot;of transcendental
 158 # importance.&quot;
 159 #
 160 # On Aug. 14, stalling while talking steadily into the NBC networks&#39; open
 161 # microphone, St. John heard five bells and waited only to hear a sixth bell,
 162 # before announcing confidently: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, World War II is over.
 163 # The Japanese have agreed to our surrender terms.&quot;
 164 #
 165 # He had scored a 20-second scoop on other broadcasters.
 166 
 167 # From Arthur David Olson (2005-08-22):
 168 # Paul has been careful to use the &quot;US&quot; rules only in those locations
 169 # that are part of the United States; this reflects the real scope of
 170 # U.S. government action.  So even though the &quot;US&quot; rules have changed

 377 # time.  Though delayed by the Great Fire, by 1880 a wire ran from the
 378 # Dearborn Observatory (on the University of Chicago campus) to City Hall,
 379 # which then sent signals to police and fire stations.  However, railroads got
 380 # their time signals from the Allegheny Observatory, the Madison Observatory,
 381 # the Ann Arbor Observatory, etc., so their clocks did not agree with each
 382 # other or with the city&#39;s official time.  The confusion took some years to
 383 # clear up.  See:
 384 # Moser M. How Chicago gave America its time zones. Chicago. 2018-01-04.

 399 # From an email administrator of the City of Fort Pierre, SD (2015-12-21):
 400 # Fort Pierre is technically located in the Mountain time zone as is
 401 # the rest of Stanley County.  Most of Stanley County and Fort Pierre
 402 # uses the Central time zone due to doing most of their business in
 403 # Pierre so it simplifies schedules.  I have lived in Stanley County
 404 # all my life and it has been that way since I can remember.  (43 years!)
 405 #
 406 # From Paul Eggert (2015-12-25):
 407 # Assume this practice predates 1970, so Fort Pierre can use America/Chicago.

 509 # In another measure to save electricity, DST was instituted from 1948-03-14
 510 # at 02:01 to 1949-01-16 at 02:00, with the governor having the option to move
 511 # the fallback transition earlier.  See pages 3-4 of:

 513 #
 514 # In response:
 515 #
 516 #   Governor Warren received a torrent of objecting mail, and it is not too much
 517 #   to speculate that the objections to Daylight Saving Time were one important
 518 #   factor in the defeat of the Dewey-Warren Presidential ticket in California.
 519 #     -- Ross, p 25
 520 #
 521 # On December 8 the governor exercised the option, setting the date to January 1
 522 # (LA Times 1948-12-09).  The transition time was 02:00 (LA Times 1949-01-01).
 523 #
 524 # Despite the controversy, in 1949 California voters approved Proposition 12,
 525 # which established DST from April&#39;s last Sunday at 01:00 until September&#39;s

 547 # Howse writes that Alaska switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar,
 548 # and from east-of-GMT to west-of-GMT days, when the US bought it from Russia.
 549 # On Friday, 1867-10-18 (Gregorian), at precisely 15:30 local time, the
 550 # Russian forts and fleet at Sitka fired salutes to mark the ceremony of
 551 # formal transfer.  See the Sacramento Daily Union (1867-11-14), p 3, col 2.
 552 # https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SDU18671114.2.12.1
 553 # Sitka workers did not change their calendars until Sunday, 1867-10-20,
 554 # and so celebrated two Sundays that week.  See: Ahllund T (tr Hallamaa P).
 555 # From the memoirs of a Finnish workman. Alaska History. 2006 Fall;21(2):1-25.

 557 # Include only the time zone part of this transition, ignoring the switch
 558 # from Julian to Gregorian, since we can&#39;t represent the Julian calendar.
 559 #
 560 # As far as we know, of the locations mentioned below only Sitka was
 561 # permanently inhabited in 1867 by anyone using either calendar.
 562 # (Yakutat was colonized by the Russians in 1799, but the settlement was
 563 # destroyed in 1805 by a Yakutat-kon war party.)  Many of Alaska&#39;s inhabitants
 564 # were unaware of the US acquisition of Alaska, much less of any calendar or
 565 # time change.  However, the Russian-influenced part of Alaska did observe
 566 # Russian time, and it is more accurate to model this than to ignore it.
 567 # The database format requires an exact transition time; use the Russian
 568 # salute as a somewhat-arbitrary time for the formal transfer of control for
 569 # all of Alaska.  Sitka&#39;s UTC offset is -9:01:13; adjust its 15:30 to the
 570 # local times of other Alaskan locations so that they change simultaneously.

 584 # From Arthur David Olson (2011-02-01):
 585 # Here&#39;s database-relevant material from the 2001 &quot;Alaska History&quot; article:
 586 #
 587 # On September 20 [1979]...DOT...officials decreed that on April 27,
 588 # 1980, Juneau and other nearby communities would move to Yukon Time.
 589 # Sitka, Petersburg, Wrangell, and Ketchikan, however, would remain on
 590 # Pacific Time.
 591 #
 592 # ...on September 22, 1980, DOT Secretary Neil E. Goldschmidt rescinded the
 593 # Department&#39;s September 1979 decision. Juneau and other communities in
 594 # northern Southeast reverted to Pacific Time on October 26.
 595 #
 596 # On October 28 [1983]...the Metlakatla Indian Community Council voted
 597 # unanimously to keep the reservation on Pacific Time.
 598 #
 599 # According to DOT official Joanne Petrie, Indian reservations are not
 600 # bound to follow time zones imposed by neighboring jurisdictions.
 601 #
 602 # (The last is consistent with how the database now handles the Navajo
 603 # Nation.)
 604

 609 # It&#39;s shortly after 1:00 here on the east coast of the United States;
 610 # the staffer said it was shortly after 10:00 there. When I asked whether
 611 # that meant they were on Pacific time, they said no - they were on their

 708 # From Arthur David Olson (2010-12-09):
 709 # &quot;Hawaiian Time&quot; by Robert C. Schmitt and Doak C. Cox appears on pages 207-225
 710 # of volume 26 of The Hawaiian Journal of History (1992). As of 2010-12-09,
 711 # the article is available at
 712 # https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/239/2/JL26215.pdf
 713 # and indicates that standard time was adopted effective noon, January
 714 # 13, 1896 (page 218), that in &quot;1933, the Legislature decreed daylight
 715 # saving for the period between the last Sunday of each April and the
 716 # last Sunday of each September, but less than a month later repealed the
 717 # act,&quot; (page 220), that year-round daylight saving time was in effect
 718 # from 1942-02-09 to 1945-09-30 (page 221, with no time of day given for
 719 # when clocks changed) and that clocks were changed by 30 minutes
 720 # effective the second Sunday of June, 1947 (page 219, with no time of
 721 # day given for when clocks changed). A footnote for the 1933 changes
 722 # cites Session Laws of Hawaii 1933, &quot;Act. 90 (approved 26 Apr. 1933)
 723 # and Act 163 (approved 21 May 1933).&quot;
 724 
 725 # From Arthur David Olson (2011-01-19):

 727 # Seventeenth Legislature: Regular Session 1933,&quot; available (as of
 728 # 2011-01-19) at American University&#39;s Pence Law Library. Page 85: &quot;Act
 729 # 90...At 2 o&#39;clock ante meridian of the last Sunday in April of each
 730 # year, the standard time of this Territory shall be advanced one
 731 # hour...This Act shall take effect upon its approval. Approved this 26th
 732 # day of April, A. D. 1933. LAWRENCE M JUDD, Governor of the Territory of
 733 # Hawaii.&quot; Page 172: &quot;Act 163...Act 90 of the Session Laws of 1933 is
 734 # hereby repealed...This Act shall take effect upon its approval, upon
 735 # which date the standard time of this Territory shall be restored to
 736 # that existing immediately prior to the taking effect of said Act 90.
 737 # Approved this 21st day of May, A. D. 1933. LAWRENCE M. JUDD, Governor
 738 # of the Territory of Hawaii.&quot;
 739 #
 740 # Note that 1933-05-21 was a Sunday.
 741 # We&#39;re left to guess the time of day when Act 163 was approved; guess noon.

 762 # personnel, and some engaged in interstate commerce continued to
 763 # observe war (i.e., daylight saving) time.  The 1944-03-17 Phoenix
 764 # Gazette says that was the date the law changed, and that 04-01 was
 765 # the date the state&#39;s clocks would change.  In 1945 the State of
 766 # Arizona used standard time all year, again with exceptions only as
 767 # mandated by federal law.  Arizona observed DST in 1967, but Arizona
 768 # Laws 1968, ch. 183 (effective 1968-03-21) repealed DST.

 810 #
 811 # From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
 812 # Since 1970, most of Indiana has been like America/Indiana/Indianapolis,
 813 # with the following exceptions:
 814 #
 815 # - Gibson, Jasper, Lake, LaPorte, Newton, Porter, Posey, Spencer,
 816 #   Vanderburgh, and Warrick counties have been like America/Chicago.
 817 #
 818 # - Dearborn and Ohio counties have been like America/New_York.
 819 #
 820 # - Clark, Floyd, and Harrison counties have been like
 821 #   America/Kentucky/Louisville.
 822 #
 823 # - Crawford, Daviess, Dubois, Knox, Martin, Perry, Pike, Pulaski, Starke,
 824 #   and Switzerland counties have their own time zone histories as noted below.
 825 #
 826 # Shanks partitioned Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
 827 # and wrote &quot;Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.&quot;
 828 # Those Hoosiers!  Such a flighty and changeable people!
 829 # Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
 830 #
 831 # Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
 832 # that they would be ambiguous if we left them at the &#39;America&#39; level.
 833 # So we reluctantly put them all in a subdirectory &#39;America/Indiana&#39;.

 837 # says &quot;DOT is relocating the time zone boundary in Indiana to move Starke,
 838 # Pulaski, Knox, Daviess, Martin, Pike, Dubois, and Perry Counties from the
 839 # Eastern Time Zone to the Central Time Zone.... The effective date of
 840 # this rule is 2 a.m. EST Sunday, April 2, 2006, which is the
 841 # changeover date from standard time to Daylight Saving Time.&quot;
 842 # Strictly speaking, this meant the affected counties changed their
 843 # clocks twice that night, but this obviously was in error.  The intent
 844 # was that 01:59:59 EST be followed by 02:00:00 CDT.

1023 # From Lake Cumberland LIFE
1024 # http://www.lake-cumberland.com/life/archive/news990129time.shtml
1025 # (1999-01-29) via WKYM-101.7:
1026 # Clinton County has joined Wayne County in asking the DoT to change from
1027 # the Central to the Eastern time zone....  The Wayne County government made
1028 # the same request in December.  And while Russell County officials have not
1029 # taken action, the majority of respondents to a poll conducted there in
1030 # August indicated they would like to change to &quot;fast time&quot; also.
1031 # The three Lake Cumberland counties are the farthest east of any U.S.
1032 # location in the Central time zone.
1033 #
1034 # From Rich Wales (2000-08-29):
1035 # After prolonged debate, and despite continuing deep differences of opinion,
1036 # Wayne County (central Kentucky) is switching from Central (-0600) to Eastern
1037 # (-0500) time.  They won&#39;t &quot;fall back&quot; this year.  See Sara Shipley,
1038 # The difference an hour makes, Nando Times (2000-08-29 15:33 -0400).
1039 #
1040 # From Paul Eggert (2001-07-16):
1041 # The final rule was published in the
1042 # Federal Register 65, 160 (2000-08-17), pp 50154-50158.

1052 # From Rives McDow (2000-08-30):
1053 # Here ... are all the changes in the US since 1985.
1054 # Kearny County, KS (put all of county on central;
1055 #	previously split between MST and CST) ... 1990-10

1059 # Wayne County, KY (from CST to EST) ... 2000-10
1060 #
1061 # From Paul Eggert (2001-07-17):
1062 # We don&#39;t know where the line used to be within Kearny County, KS,
1063 # so omit that change for now.
1064 # See America/Indiana/Knox for the Starke County, IN change.
1065 # See America/North_Dakota/Center for the Oliver County, ND change.
1066 # West Wendover, NV officially switched from Pacific to mountain time on
1067 # 1999-10-31.  See the
1068 # Federal Register 64, 203 (1999-10-21), pp 56705-56707.
1069 # https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-10-21/html/99-27240.htm
1070 # However, the Federal Register says that West Wendover already operated
1071 # on mountain time, and the rule merely made this official;
1072 # hence a separate tz entry is not needed.

1074 # Michigan
1075 #
1076 # From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
1077 # Michigan didn&#39;t observe DST from 1968 to 1973.
1078 #
1079 # From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
1080 # Shanks writes that Michigan started using standard time on 1885-09-18,
1081 # but Howse writes (pp 124-125, referring to Popular Astronomy, 1901-01)
1082 # that Detroit kept
1083 #
1084 #	local time until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should
1085 #	be put back twenty-eight minutes to Central Standard Time.  Half the
1086 #	city obeyed, half refused.  After considerable debate, the decision
1087 #	was rescinded and the city reverted to Sun time.  A derisive offer to
1088 #	erect a sundial in front of the city hall was referred to the
1089 #	Committee on Sewers.  Then, in 1905, Central time was adopted
1090 #	by city vote.
1091 #
1092 # This story is too entertaining to be false, so go with Howse over Shanks.
1093 #
1094 # From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
1095 # Garland (1927) writes &quot;Cleveland and Detroit advanced their clocks
1096 # one hour in 1914.&quot;  This change is not in Shanks.  We have no more
1097 # info, so omit this for now.
1098 #
1099 # From Paul Eggert (2017-07-26):
1100 # Although Shanks says Detroit observed DST in 1967 from 06-14 00:01
1101 # until 10-29 00:01, I now see multiple reports that this is incorrect.
1102 # For example, according to a 50-year anniversary report about the 1967
1103 # Detroit riots and a major-league doubleheader on 1967-07-23, &quot;By the time
1104 # the last fly ball of the doubleheader settled into the glove of leftfielder
1105 # Lenny Green, it was after 7 p.m.  Detroit did not observe daylight saving
1106 # time, so light was already starting to fail.  Twilight was made even deeper
1107 # by billowing columns of smoke that ascended in an unbroken wall north of the
1108 # ballpark.&quot;  See: Dow B. Detroit &#39;67: As violence unfolded, Tigers played two
1109 # at home vs. Yankees. Detroit Free Press 2017-07-23.

1573 #
1574 #	The clocks in Atikokan stay set on standard time year-round.
1575 #	This means they spend about half the time on central time and
1576 #	the other half on eastern time.
1577 #
1578 #	For the most part, the system works, Mayor Dennis Brown said.
1579 #
1580 #	&quot;The majority of businesses in Atikokan deal more with Eastern
1581 #	Canada, but there are some that deal with Western Canada,&quot; he
1582 #	said.  &quot;I don&#39;t see any changes happening here.&quot;
1583 #

1593 # From Paul Eggert (2006-07-17):
1594 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger say that Atikokan has agreed with Rainy River
1595 # ever since standard time was introduced, but the information from
1596 # McKinnon sounds more authoritative.  For now, assume that Atikokan
1597 # switched to EST immediately after WWII era daylight saving time
1598 # ended.  This matches the old (less-populous) America/Coral_Harbour
1599 # entry since our cutoff date of 1970, so we can move

1772 # I believe that the English legislation [of the old time act] had

1815 # Saskatchewan
1816 
1817 # From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):
1818 # The first actual adoption of DST in Canada was at the municipal
1819 # level.  As the [Toronto] Star put it (1912-06-07), &quot;While people
1820 # elsewhere have long been talking of legislation to save daylight,
1821 # the city of Moose Jaw [Saskatchewan] has acted on its own hook.&quot;
1822 # DST in Moose Jaw began on Saturday, 1912-06-01 (no time mentioned:
1823 # presumably late evening, as below), and would run until &quot;the end of
1824 # the summer&quot;.  The discrepancy between municipal time and railroad
1825 # time was noted.
1826 
1827 # From Paul Eggert (2003-07-27):
1828 # Willett (1914-03) notes that DST &quot;has been in operation ... in the
1829 # City of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, for one year.&quot;
1830 
1831 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
1832 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger say that since 1970 this region has mostly been as Regina.
1833 # Some western towns (e.g. Swift Current) switched from MST/MDT to CST in 1972.
1834 # Other western towns (e.g. Lloydminster) are like Edmonton.
1835 # Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Denare Beach and Creighton
1836 # are like Winnipeg, in violation of Saskatchewan law.
1837 
1838 # From W. Jones (1992-11-06):
1839 # The. . .below is based on information I got from our law library, the
1840 # provincial archives, and the provincial Community Services department.
1841 # A precise history would require digging through newspaper archives, and
1842 # since you didn&#39;t say what you wanted, I didn&#39;t bother.
1843 #
1844 # Saskatchewan is split by a time zone meridian (105W) and over the years
1845 # the boundary became pretty ragged as communities near it reevaluated
1846 # their affiliations in one direction or the other.  In 1965 a provincial
1847 # referendum favoured legislating common time practices.
1848 #
1849 # On 15 April 1966 the Time Act (c. T-14, Revised Statutes of
1850 # Saskatchewan 1978) was proclaimed, and established that the eastern
1851 # part of Saskatchewan would use CST year round, that districts in
1852 # northwest Saskatchewan would by default follow CST but could opt to
1853 # follow Mountain Time rules (thus 1 hour difference in the winter and
1854 # zero in the summer), and that districts in southwest Saskatchewan would
1855 # by default follow MT but could opt to follow CST.
1856 #
1857 # It took a few years for the dust to settle (I know one story of a town
1858 # on one time zone having its school in another, such that a mom had to
1859 # serve her family lunch in two shifts), but presently it seems that only
1860 # a few towns on the border with Alberta (e.g. Lloydminster) follow MT
1861 # rules any more; all other districts appear to have used CST year round
1862 # since sometime in the 1960s.
1863 
1864 # From Chris Walton (2006-06-26):
1865 # The Saskatchewan time act which was last updated in 1996 is about 30 pages
1866 # long and rather painful to read.

1937 
1938 # It seems though that (re: Creston) is not entirely correct:
1939 
1940 # From Chris Walton (2011-12-01):
1941 # There are two areas within the Canadian province of British Columbia
1942 # that do not currently observe daylight saving:
1943 # a) The Creston Valley (includes the town of Creston and surrounding area)
1944 # b) The eastern half of the Peace River Regional District
1945 # (includes the cities of Dawson Creek and Fort St. John)
1946 
1947 # Earlier this year I stumbled across a detailed article about the time
1948 # keeping history of Creston; it was written by Tammy Hardwick who is the
1949 # manager of the Creston &amp; District Museum. The article was written in May 2009.
1950 # http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&amp;t=spec&amp;ar=260
1951 # According to the article, Creston has not changed its clocks since June 1918.
1952 # i.e. Creston has been stuck on UT-7 for 93 years.
1953 # Dawson Creek, on the other hand, changed its clocks as recently as April 1972.
1954 
1955 # Unfortunately the exact date for the time change in June 1918 remains
1956 # unknown and will be difficult to ascertain.  I e-mailed Tammy a few months
1957 # ago to ask if Sunday June 2 was a reasonable guess.  She said it was just
1958 # as plausible as any other date (in June).  She also said that after writing
1959 # the article she had discovered another time change in 1916; this is the
1960 # subject of another article which she wrote in October 2010.
1961 # http://www.creston.museum.bc.ca/index.php?module=comments&amp;uop=view_comment&amp;cm+id=56
1962 
1963 # Here is a summary of the three clock change events in Creston&#39;s history:
1964 # 1. 1884 or 1885: adoption of Mountain Standard Time (GMT-7)
1965 # Exact date unknown
1966 # 2. Oct 1916: switch to Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8)
1967 # Exact date in October unknown; Sunday October 1 is a reasonable guess.
1968 # 3. June 1918: switch to Pacific Daylight Time (GMT-7)
1969 # Exact date in June unknown; Sunday June 2 is a reasonable guess.
1970 # note 1:
1971 # On Oct 27/1918 when daylight saving ended in the rest of Canada,
1972 # Creston did not change its clocks.
1973 # note 2:
1974 # During WWII when the Federal Government legislated a mandatory clock change,
1975 # Creston did not oblige.
1976 # note 3:
1977 # There is no guarantee that Creston will remain on Mountain Standard Time
1978 # (UTC-7) forever.
1979 # The subject was debated at least once this year by the town Council.
1980 # http://www.bclocalnews.com/kootenay_rockies/crestonvalleyadvance/news/116760809.html
1981 
1982 # During a period WWII, summer time (Daylight saying) was mandatory in Canada.
1983 # In Creston, that was handled by shifting the area to PST (-8:00) then applying
1984 # summer time to cause the offset to be -7:00, the same as it had been before
1985 # the change.  It can be argued that the timezone abbreviation during this
1986 # period should be PDT rather than MST, but that doesn&#39;t seem important enough
1987 # (to anyone) to further complicate the rules.
1988 
1989 # The transition dates (and times) are guesses.

2167 
2168 # From Rives McDow (1999-11-08):
2169 # On October 31, when the rest of Nunavut went to Central time,
2170 # Pangnirtung wobbled.  Here is the result of their wobble:
2171 #
2172 # The following businesses and organizations in Pangnirtung use Central Time:
2173 #
2174 #	First Air, Power Corp, Nunavut Construction, Health Center, RCMP,
2175 #	Eastern Arctic National Parks, A &amp; D Specialist
2176 #
2177 # The following businesses and organizations in Pangnirtung use Eastern Time:
2178 #
2179 #	Hamlet office, All other businesses, Both schools, Airport operator
2180 #
2181 # This has made for an interesting situation there, which warranted the news.
2182 # No one there that I spoke with seems concerned, or has plans to
2183 # change the local methods of keeping time, as it evidently does not
2184 # really interfere with any activities or make things difficult locally.
2185 # They plan to celebrate New Year&#39;s turn-over twice, one hour apart,
2186 # so it appears that the situation will last at least that long.

2199 # From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
2200 # Matthews and Vincent (1998) say the following, but we lack histories
2201 # for these potential new Zones.
2202 #
2203 # The Canadian Forces station at Alert uses Eastern Time while the
2204 # handful of residents at the Eureka weather station [in the Central
2205 # zone] skip daylight savings.  Baffin Island, which is crossed by the
2206 # Central, Eastern and Atlantic Time zones only uses Eastern Time.
2207 # Gjoa Haven, Taloyoak and Pelly Bay all use Mountain instead of
2208 # Central Time and Southampton Island [in the Central zone] is not
2209 # required to use daylight savings.
2210 
2211 # From &lt;http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/nunavut001130/nvt21110_02.html&gt;
2212 # Nunavut now has two time zones (2000-11-10):
2213 # The Nunavut government would allow its employees in Kugluktuk and
2214 # Cambridge Bay to operate on central time year-round, putting them
2215 # one hour behind the rest of Nunavut for six months during the winter.
2216 # At the end of October the two communities had rebelled against
2217 # Nunavut&#39;s unified time zone, refusing to shift to eastern time with
2218 # the rest of the territory for the winter.  Cambridge Bay remained on
2219 # central time, while Kugluktuk, even farther west, reverted to
2220 # mountain time, which they had used before the advent of Nunavut&#39;s

2240 # According to ...
2241 # http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/geomap.asp
2242 # (from a 1998 Canadian Geographic article), the de facto and de jure time
2243 # for Southampton Island (at the north end of Hudson Bay) is UTC-5 all year
2244 # round.  Using Google, it&#39;s easy to find other websites that confirm this.
2245 # I wasn&#39;t able to find how far back this time regimen goes, but since it
2246 # predates the creation of Nunavut, it probably goes back many years....
2247 # The Inuktitut name of Coral Harbour is Sallit, but it&#39;s rarely used.
2248 #
2249 # From Paul Eggert (2014-10-17):
2250 # For lack of better information, assume that Southampton Island observed
2251 # daylight saving only during wartime.  Gwillim Law&#39;s email also
2252 # mentioned maps now maintained by National Research Council Canada;

2255 # From Chris Walton (2007-03-01):
2256 # ... the community of Resolute (located on Cornwallis Island in
2257 # Nunavut) moved from Central Time to Eastern Time last November.
2258 # Basically the community did not change its clocks at the end of
2259 # daylight saving....
2260 # http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2006-11/nov13_06none.html
2261 
2262 # From Chris Walton (2011-03-21):
2263 # Back in 2007 I initiated the creation of a new &quot;zone file&quot; for Resolute
2264 # Bay. Resolute Bay is a small community located about 900km north of
2265 # the Arctic Circle. The zone file was required because Resolute Bay had
2266 # decided to use UTC-5 instead of UTC-6 for the winter of 2006-2007.
2267 #
2268 # According to new information which I received last week, Resolute Bay
2269 # went back to using UTC-6 in the winter of 2007-2008...
2270 #
2271 # On March 11/2007 most of Canada went onto daylight saving. On March
2272 # 14/2007 I phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office to do a &quot;time check.&quot; I
2273 # talked to somebody that was both knowledgeable and helpful. I was able
2274 # to confirm that Resolute Bay was still operating on UTC-5. It was
2275 # explained to me that Resolute Bay had been on the Eastern Time zone
2276 # (EST) in the winter, and was now back on the Central Time zone (CDT).
2277 # i.e. the time zone had changed twice in the last year but the clocks
2278 # had not moved. The residents had to know which time zone they were in
2279 # so they could follow the correct TV schedule...
2280 #
2281 # On Nov 02/2008 most of Canada went onto standard time. On Nov 03/2008 I
2282 # phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office...[D]ue to the challenging nature
2283 # of the phone call, I decided to seek out an alternate source of
2284 # information. I found an e-mail address for somebody by the name of
2285 # Stephanie Adams whose job was listed as &quot;Inns North Support Officer for
2286 # Arctic Co-operatives.&quot; I was under the impression that Stephanie lived
2287 # and worked in Resolute Bay...
2288 #
2289 # On March 14/2011 I phoned the hamlet office again. I was told that
2290 # Resolute Bay had been using Central Standard Time over the winter of
2291 # 2010-2011 and that the clocks had therefore been moved one hour ahead
2292 # on March 13/2011. The person I talked to was aware that Resolute Bay
2293 # had previously experimented with Eastern Standard Time but he could not
2294 # tell me when the practice had stopped.
2295 #
2296 # On March 17/2011 I searched the Web to find an e-mail address of
2297 # somebody that might be able to tell me exactly when Resolute Bay went
2298 # off Eastern Standard Time. I stumbled on the name &quot;Aziz Kheraj.&quot; Aziz
2299 # used to be the mayor of Resolute Bay and he apparently owns half the
2300 # businesses including &quot;South Camp Inn.&quot; This website has some info on
2301 # Aziz:
2302 # http://www.uphere.ca/node/493
2303 #
2304 # I sent Aziz an e-mail asking when Resolute Bay had stopped using
2305 # Eastern Standard Time.
2306 #
2307 # Aziz responded quickly with this: &quot;hi, The time was not changed for the
2308 # 1 year only, the following year, the community went back to the old way
2309 # of &quot;spring ahead-fall behind&quot; currently we are zulu plus 5 hrs and in
2310 # the winter Zulu plus 6 hrs&quot;
2311 #
2312 # This of course conflicted with everything I had ascertained in November 2008.
2313 #
2314 # I sent Aziz a copy of my 2008 e-mail exchange with Stephanie. Aziz
2315 # responded with this: &quot;Hi, Stephanie lives in Winnipeg. I live here, You
2316 # may want to check with the weather office in Resolute Bay or do a
2317 # search on the weather through Env. Canada. web site&quot;
2318 #
2319 # If I had realized the Stephanie did not live in Resolute Bay I would
2320 # never have contacted her.  I now believe that all the information I
2321 # obtained in November 2008 should be ignored...

2395 # Here are the discrepancies between Shanks &amp; Pottenger (S&amp;P) and the MLoC.
2396 # (In all cases we go with the MLoC.)
2397 # S&amp;P report that Baja was at -8:00 in 1922/1923.
2398 # S&amp;P say the 1930 transition in Baja was 1930-11-16.
2399 # S&amp;P report no DST during summer 1931.
2400 # S&amp;P report a transition at 1932-03-30 23:00, not 1932-04-01.
2401 
2402 # From Gwillim Law (2001-02-20):
2403 # There are some other discrepancies between the Decrees page and the
2404 # tz database.  I think they can best be explained by supposing that
2405 # the researchers who prepared the Decrees page failed to find some of
2406 # the relevant documents.

2413 #
2414 # I finally got my hands on the Official Presidential Decree that sets up the
2415 # rules for the DST changes. The rules are:
2416 #
2417 # 1. The country is divided in 3 timezones:
2418 #    - Baja California Norte (the Mexico/BajaNorte TZ)
2419 #    - Baja California Sur, Nayarit, Sinaloa and Sonora (the Mexico/BajaSur TZ)
2420 #    - The rest of the country (the Mexico/General TZ)
2421 #
2422 # 2. From the first Sunday in April at 2:00 AM to the last Sunday in October
2423 #    at 2:00 AM, the times in each zone are as follows:
2424 #    BajaNorte: GMT+7
2425 #    BajaSur:   GMT+6
2426 #    General:   GMT+5
2427 #
2428 # 3. The rest of the year, the times are as follows:
2429 #    BajaNorte: GMT+8
2430 #    BajaSur:   GMT+7
2431 #    General:   GMT+6
2432 #

2764 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
2765 # Formerly there was an America/Ensenada zone, which differed from
2766 # America/Tijuana only in that it did not observe DST from 1976
2767 # through 1995.  This was as per Shanks (1999).  But Shanks &amp; Pottenger say
2768 # Ensenada did not observe DST from 1948 through 1975.  Guy Harris reports
2769 # that the 1987 OAG says &quot;Only Ensenada, Mexicali, San Felipe and
2770 # Tijuana observe DST,&quot; which agrees with Shanks &amp; Pottenger but implies that
2771 # DST-observance was a town-by-town matter back then.  This concerns
2772 # data after 1970 so most likely there should be at least one Zone
2773 # other than America/Tijuana for Baja, but it&#39;s not clear yet what its

3165 # Haiti
3166 # From Gwillim Law (2005-04-15):
3167 # Risto O. Nykänen wrote me that Haiti is now on DST.
3168 # I searched for confirmation, and I found a press release
3169 # on the Web page of the Haitian Consulate in Chicago (2005-03-31),
3170 # &lt;http://www.haitianconsulate.org/time.doc&gt;.  Translated from French, it says:
3171 #
3172 #  &quot;The Prime Minister&#39;s Communication Office notifies the public in general
3173 #   and the press in particular that, following a decision of the Interior
3174 #   Ministry and the Territorial Collectivities [I suppose that means the
3175 #   provinces], Haiti will move to Eastern Daylight Time in the night from next
3176 #   Saturday the 2nd to Sunday the 3rd.
3177 #
3178 #  &quot;Consequently, the Prime Minister&#39;s Communication Office wishes to inform
3179 #   the population that the country&#39;s clocks will be set forward one hour
3180 #   starting at midnight.  This provision will hold until the last Saturday in
3181 #   October 2005.

3183 #  &quot;Port-au-Prince, March 31, 2005&quot;
3184 #
3185 # From Steffen Thorsen (2006-04-04):
3186 # I have been informed by users that Haiti observes DST this year like
3187 # last year, so the current &quot;only&quot; rule for 2005 might be changed to a
3188 # &quot;max&quot; rule or to last until 2006. (Who knows if they will observe DST
3189 # next year or if they will extend their DST like US/Canada next year).
3190 #
3191 # I have found this article about it (in French):
3192 # http://www.haitipressnetwork.com/news.cfm?articleID=7612
3193 #
3194 # The reason seems to be an energy crisis.
3195

3200 # According to several news sources, Haiti will observe DST this year,

3202 # So this means they have already changed their time.

3210 # Assume a US-style fall back as well.
3211 
3212 # From Steffen Thorsen (2013-03-10):
3213 # It appears that Haiti is observing DST this year as well, same rules

3341 # assume that it is daylight saving....

3344 # The Associated Press story on the time change, which can be found at
3345 # http://www.lapalmainteractivo.com/guias/content/gen/ap/America_Latina/AMC_GEN_NICARAGUA_HORA.html
3346 # and elsewhere, says (fifth paragraph, translated from Spanish): &quot;The last
3347 # time that a change of clocks was applied to save energy was in the year 2000
3348 # during the Arnoldo Alemán administration.&quot;...
3349 # The northamerica file says that Nicaragua has been on UTC-6 continuously
3350 # since December 1998.  I wasn&#39;t able to find any details of Nicaraguan time
3351 # changes in 2000.  Perhaps a note could be added to the northamerica file, to
3352 # the effect that we have indirect evidence that DST was observed in 2000.
3353 #
3354 # From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-11-02):
3355 # Nicaragua left DST the 2005-10-02 at 00:00 (local time).
