 24 # tzdb data for ships at sea and other miscellany
 25 
 26 # This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
 27 # 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.
 28 
 29 # These entries are mostly present for historical reasons, so that
 30 # people in areas not otherwise covered by the tz files could &quot;zic -l&quot;
 31 # to a timezone that was right for their area.  These days, the
 32 # tz files cover almost all the inhabited world, and the only practical
 33 # need now for the entries that are not on UTC are for ships at sea
 34 # that cannot use POSIX TZ settings.
 35 
 36 # Starting with POSIX 1003.1-2001, the entries below are all
 37 # unnecessary as settings for the TZ environment variable.  E.g.,
 38 # instead of TZ=&#39;Etc/GMT+4&#39; one can use the POSIX setting TZ=&#39;&lt;-04&gt;+4&#39;.
 39 #
 40 # Do not use a POSIX TZ setting like TZ=&#39;GMT+4&#39;, which is four hours
 41 # behind GMT but uses the completely misleading abbreviation &quot;GMT&quot;.

 47 # The following link uses older naming conventions,
 48 # but it belongs here, not in the file &#39;backward&#39;,
 49 # as functions like gmtime load the &quot;GMT&quot; file to handle leap seconds properly.
 50 # We want this to work even on installations that omit the other older names.

 61 # Be consistent with POSIX TZ settings in the Zone names,
 62 # even though this is the opposite of what many people expect.
 63 # POSIX has positive signs west of Greenwich, but many people expect
 64 # positive signs east of Greenwich.  For example, TZ=&#39;Etc/GMT+4&#39; uses
 65 # the abbreviation &quot;-04&quot; and corresponds to 4 hours behind UT
 66 # (i.e. west of Greenwich) even though many people would expect it to
 67 # mean 4 hours ahead of UT (i.e. east of Greenwich).
 68 
 69 # Earlier incarnations of this package were not POSIX-compliant,
 70 # and had lines such as
 71 #		Zone	GMT-12		-12	-	GMT-1200
 72 # We did not want things to change quietly if someone accustomed to the old
 73 # way does a
 74 #		zic -l GMT-12
 75 # so we moved the names into the Etc subdirectory.
 76 # Also, the time zone abbreviations are now compatible with %z.
