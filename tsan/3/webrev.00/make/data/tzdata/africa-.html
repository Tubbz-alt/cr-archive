  34 # From Paul Eggert (2018-05-27):
  35 #
  36 # Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
  37 # Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
  38 # San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
  39 # Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
  40 #
  41 # Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
  42 # for time zone data was the International Air Transport
  43 # Association&#39;s Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
  44 # published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
  45 # of the IATA&#39;s data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
  46 # IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
  47 #
  48 # Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
  49 # Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
  50 # I found in the UCLA library.
  51 #
  52 # For data circa 1899, a common source is:
  53 # Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899 Feb;13(2):173-94.
  54 # https://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359
  55 #
  56 # A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
  57 # Derek Howse, Greenwich time and longitude, Philip Wilson Publishers (1997).
  58 #
  59 # European-style abbreviations are commonly used along the Mediterranean.
  60 # For sub-Saharan Africa abbreviations were less standardized.
  61 # Previous editions of this database used WAT, CAT, SAT, and EAT
  62 # for UT +00 through +03, respectively,
  63 # but in 1997 Mark R V Murray reported that
  64 # &#39;SAST&#39; is the official abbreviation for +02 in the country of South Africa,
  65 # &#39;CAT&#39; is commonly used for +02 in countries north of South Africa, and
  66 # &#39;WAT&#39; is probably the best name for +01, as the common phrase for
  67 # the area that includes Nigeria is &quot;West Africa&quot;.
  68 #
  69 # To summarize, the following abbreviations seemed to have some currency:
  70 #	 +00	GMT	Greenwich Mean Time
  71 #	 +02	CAT	Central Africa Time
  72 #	 +02	SAST	South Africa Standard Time
  73 # and Murray suggested the following abbreviation:
  74 #	 +01	WAT	West Africa Time
  75 # Murray&#39;s suggestion seems to have caught on in news reports and the like.
  76 # I vaguely recall &#39;WAT&#39; also being used for -01 in the past but
  77 # cannot now come up with solid citations.
  78 #
  79 # I invented the following abbreviations in the 1990s:
  80 #	 +02	WAST	West Africa Summer Time
  81 #	 +03	CAST	Central Africa Summer Time
  82 #	 +03	SAST	South Africa Summer Time
  83 #	 +03	EAT	East Africa Time
  84 # &#39;EAT&#39; seems to have caught on and is in current timestamps, and though
  85 # the other abbreviations are rarer and are only in past timestamps,
  86 # they are paired with better-attested non-DST abbreviations.
  87 # Corrections are welcome.

 251 # From Abdelrahman Hassan (2007-09-06):
 252 # Due to the Hijri (lunar Islamic calendar) year being 11 days shorter
 253 # than the year of the Gregorian calendar, Ramadan shifts earlier each
 254 # year. This year it will be observed September 13 (September is quite
 255 # hot in Egypt), and the idea is to make fasting easier for workers by
 256 # shifting business hours one hour out of daytime heat. Consequently,
 257 # unless discontinued, next DST may end Thursday 28 August 2008.

 590 #
 591 # A little strange though, since the article says that they moved the date
 592 # to align itself with Europe and USA which also change time on that date,
 593 # but that means they have not paid attention to what happened in
