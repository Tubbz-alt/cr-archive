 270 # this is required for correct handling of times before 1916 by

 887 # From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 888 # Daylight saving time has long been controversial in Australia, pitting
 889 # region against region, rural against urban, and local against global.
 890 # For example, in her review of Graeme Davison&#39;s _The Unforgiving
 891 # Minute: how Australians learned to tell the time_ (1993), Perth native
 892 # Phillipa J Martyr wrote, &quot;The section entitled &#39;Saving Daylight&#39; was
 893 # very informative, but was (as can, sadly, only be expected from a
</pre>
<hr />
<pre>
1193 # ... it was just on four years ago that I drove along the Eyre Highway,
1194 # which passes through eastern Western Australia close to the southern
1195 # coast of the continent.
1196 #
1197 # I paid particular attention to the time kept there. There can be no
1198 # dispute that UTC+08:45 was considered &quot;the time&quot; from the border
1199 # village just inside the border with South Australia to as far west
1200 # as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is
1201 # the largest population centre in this zone....
1202 #
1203 # Now that Western Australia is observing daylight saving, the
1204 # question arose whether this part of the state would follow suit. I
1205 # just called the border village and confirmed that indeed they have,
1206 # meaning that they are now observing UTC+09:45.
1207 #
1208 # (2006-12-09):
1209 # I personally doubt that either experimentation with daylight saving
1210 # in WA or its introduction in SA had anything to do with the genesis
1211 # of this time zone.  My hunch is that it&#39;s been around since well
1212 # before 1975.  I remember seeing it noted on road maps decades ago.

1521 # time in the Chatham Islands.  The time there is 45 minutes in advance of New
1522 # Zealand time.  I understand that is the time they keep locally, anyhow.&quot;
1523 # For now, assume this practice goes back to the introduction of standard time

 955 # From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 956 # Daylight saving time has long been controversial in Australia, pitting
 957 # region against region, rural against urban, and local against global.
 958 # For example, in her review of Graeme Davison&#39;s _The Unforgiving
 959 # Minute: how Australians learned to tell the time_ (1993), Perth native
 960 # Phillipa J Martyr wrote, &quot;The section entitled &#39;Saving Daylight&#39; was

1261 # ... it was just on four years ago that I drove along the Eyre Highway,
1262 # which passes through eastern Western Australia close to the southern
1263 # coast of the continent.
1264 #
1265 # I paid particular attention to the time kept there. There can be no
1266 # dispute that UTC+08:45 was considered &quot;the time&quot; from the border
1267 # village just inside the border with South Australia to as far west
1268 # as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is
1269 # the largest population centre in this zone....
1270 #
1271 # Now that Western Australia is observing daylight saving, the
1272 # question arose whether this part of the state would follow suit. I
1273 # just called the border village and confirmed that indeed they have,
1274 # meaning that they are now observing UTC+09:45.
1275 #
1276 # (2006-12-09):
1277 # I personally doubt that either experimentation with daylight saving
1278 # in WA or its introduction in SA had anything to do with the genesis
1279 # of this time zone.  My hunch is that it&#39;s been around since well
1280 # before 1975.  I remember seeing it noted on road maps decades ago.

2107 # to the east side of the Phoenix and Line Islands), I suppose that most
2108 # mapmakers redrew the IDL following the boundary of Kiribati.  Even that line
2109 # has a rather arbitrary nature.  The straight-line boundaries between Pacific
2110 # island nations that are shown on many maps are based on an international
2111 # convention, but are not legally binding national borders.... The date is
2112 # governed by the IDL; therefore, even on the high seas, there may be some
