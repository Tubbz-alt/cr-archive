 # Shanks says that DST was called "War Time" in the US in 1918 and 1919.
 # However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which
 # was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently
 # time was just called "Standard Time" or "Daylight Saving Time".
 
-# From Arthur David Olson:
-# US Daylight Saving Time ended on the last Sunday of *October* in 1974.
-# See, for example, the front page of the Saturday, 1974-10-26

+# From Paul Eggert (2015-04-06):
+# In 1950s Nashville a public clock had dueling faces, one for conservatives
+# and the other for liberals; the two sides didn't agree about the time of day.
+# I haven't found a photo of this clock, nor have I tracked down the TIME
+# magazine report cited below, but here's the story as told by the late
+# American journalist John Seigenthaler, who was there:
+#
+# "The two [newspaper] owners held strongly contrasting political and
+# ideological views.  Evans was a New South liberal, Stahlman an Old South
+# conservative, and their two papers frequently clashed editorially, often on
+# the same day....  In the 1950s as the state legislature was grappling with
+# the question of whether to approve daylight saving time for the entire state,
+# TIME magazine reported:
+#
+# "'The Nashville Banner and The Nashville Tennessean rarely agree on anything
+# but the time of day - and last week they couldn't agree on that.'
+#
+# "It was all too true. The clock on the front of the building had two faces -
+# The Tennessean side of the building facing west, the other, east.  When it
+# was high noon Banner time, it was 11 a.m. Tennessean time."
+#
+# Seigenthaler J. For 100 years, Tennessean had it covered.

+# A brief but entertaining history of time in Indiana describes a 1949 debate
+# in the Indiana House where city legislators (who favored "fast time")
+# tussled with farm legislators (who didn't) over a bill to outlaw DST:
+#  "Lacking enough votes, the city faction tries to filibuster until time runs
+#   out on the session at midnight, but rural champion Rep. Herbert Copeland,
+#   R-Madison, leans over the gallery railing and forces the official clock
+#   back to 9 p.m., breaking it in the process.  The clock sticks on 9 as the
+#   debate rages on into the night.  The filibuster finally dies out and the
+#   bill passes, while outside the chamber, clocks read 3:30 a.m.  In the end,
+#   it doesn't matter which side won.  The law has no enforcement powers and
+#   is simply ignored by fast-time communities."

+# Due to a complicated set of legal maneuvers, in 1967 Michigan did
+# not start daylight saving time when the rest of the US did.
+# Instead, it began DST on Jun 14 at 00:01.  This was big news:
+# the Detroit Free Press reported it at the top of Page 1 on
+# 1967-06-14, in an article "State Adjusting to Switch to Fast Time"
+# by Gary Blonston, above an article about Thurgood Marshall's

+# observed DST until 1967-10-29 00:01, that time of day seems to be
+# incorrect, as the Free Press later said DST ended in Michigan at the
+# same time as the rest of the US.  Also, although Shanks reports no DST in
+# Detroit in 1968, it did observe DST that year; in the November 1968
+# election Michigan voters narrowly repealed DST, effective 1969.
