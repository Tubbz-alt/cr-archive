  99 #	valuable if I stay in bed after the sun has risen.  As an admirer
 100 #	of moonlight I resent the bossy insistence of those who want to
 101 #	reduce my time for enjoying it.  At the back of the Daylight Saving
 102 #	scheme I detect the bony, blue-fingered hand of Puritanism, eager
 103 #	to push people into bed earlier, and get them up earlier, to make
 104 #	them healthy, wealthy and wise in spite of themselves.

 114 # Shanks says that DST was called &quot;War Time&quot; in the US in 1918 and 1919.
 115 # However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which
 116 # was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently
 117 # time was just called &quot;Standard Time&quot; or &quot;Daylight Saving Time&quot;.

 465 # From Paul Eggert (2018-10-25):
 466 # On 1921-03-04 federal law placed all of Texas into the central time zone.

 469 # and they weren&#39;t about to let the federal government tell them what to do.
 470 # Eventually the federal government gave in and changed the law on
 471 # 1970-04-10 to match what El Paso was actually doing.  Although
 472 # that&#39;s slightly after our 1970 cutoff, there is no need to create a

 728 # 2011-01-19) at American University&#39;s Pence Law Library. Page 85: &quot;Act
 729 # 90...At 2 o&#39;clock ante meridian of the last Sunday in April of each
 730 # year, the standard time of this Territory shall be advanced one
 731 # hour...This Act shall take effect upon its approval. Approved this 26th
 732 # day of April, A. D. 1933. LAWRENCE M JUDD, Governor of the Territory of
 733 # Hawaii.&quot; Page 172: &quot;Act 163...Act 90 of the Session Laws of 1933 is
 734 # hereby repealed...This Act shall take effect upon its approval, upon
 735 # which date the standard time of this Territory shall be restored to

 754 # From Paul Eggert (2002-10-20):

 756 # The information in the rest of this paragraph is derived from the
 757 # Daylight Saving Time web page
 758 # &lt;http://www.dlapr.lib.az.us/links/daylight.htm&gt; (2002-01-23)
 759 # maintained by the Arizona State Library, Archives and Public Records.
 760 # Between 1944-01-01 and 1944-04-01 the State of Arizona used standard
 761 # time, but by federal law railroads, airlines, bus lines, military
 762 # personnel, and some engaged in interstate commerce continued to
 763 # observe war (i.e., daylight saving) time.  The 1944-03-17 Phoenix
 764 # Gazette says that was the date the law changed, and that 04-01 was
 765 # the date the state&#39;s clocks would change.  In 1945 the State of
 766 # Arizona used standard time all year, again with exceptions only as
 767 # mandated by federal law.  Arizona observed DST in 1967, but Arizona
 768 # Laws 1968, ch. 183 (effective 1968-03-21) repealed DST.
 769 #
 770 # Shanks says the 1944 experiment came to an end on 1944-03-17.
 771 # Go with the Arizona State Library instead.

 810 #
















 811 # From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
 812 # Since 1970, most of Indiana has been like America/Indiana/Indianapolis,
 813 # with the following exceptions:
 814 #
 815 # - Gibson, Jasper, Lake, LaPorte, Newton, Porter, Posey, Spencer,
 816 #   Vanderburgh, and Warrick counties have been like America/Chicago.
 817 #
 818 # - Dearborn and Ohio counties have been like America/New_York.
 819 #
 820 # - Clark, Floyd, and Harrison counties have been like
 821 #   America/Kentucky/Louisville.
 822 #
 823 # - Crawford, Daviess, Dubois, Knox, Martin, Perry, Pike, Pulaski, Starke,
 824 #   and Switzerland counties have their own time zone histories as noted below.
 825 #
 826 # Shanks partitioned Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
 827 # and wrote &quot;Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.&quot;
 828 # Those Hoosiers!  Such a flighty and changeable people!
 829 # Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.

1023 # From Lake Cumberland LIFE
1024 # http://www.lake-cumberland.com/life/archive/news990129time.shtml
1025 # (1999-01-29) via WKYM-101.7:
1026 # Clinton County has joined Wayne County in asking the DoT to change from
1027 # the Central to the Eastern time zone....  The Wayne County government made
1028 # the same request in December.  And while Russell County officials have not
1029 # taken action, the majority of respondents to a poll conducted there in
1030 # August indicated they would like to change to &quot;fast time&quot; also.

<hr />

1079 # From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
1080 # Shanks writes that Michigan started using standard time on 1885-09-18,
1081 # but Howse writes (pp 124-125, referring to Popular Astronomy, 1901-01)
1082 # that Detroit kept
1083 #
1084 #	local time until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should
1085 #	be put back twenty-eight minutes to Central Standard Time.  Half the
1086 #	city obeyed, half refused.  After considerable debate, the decision
1087 #	was rescinded and the city reverted to Sun time.  A derisive offer to
1088 #	erect a sundial in front of the city hall was referred to the
1089 #	Committee on Sewers.  Then, in 1905, Central time was adopted
1090 #	by city vote.
1091 #
1092 # This story is too entertaining to be false, so go with Howse over Shanks.
1093 #
1094 # From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
1095 # Garland (1927) writes &quot;Cleveland and Detroit advanced their clocks
1096 # one hour in 1914.&quot;  This change is not in Shanks.  We have no more
1097 # info, so omit this for now.

1817 # From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):
1818 # The first actual adoption of DST in Canada was at the municipal
1819 # level.  As the [Toronto] Star put it (1912-06-07), &quot;While people
1820 # elsewhere have long been talking of legislation to save daylight,
1821 # the city of Moose Jaw [Saskatchewan] has acted on its own hook.&quot;
1822 # DST in Moose Jaw began on Saturday, 1912-06-01 (no time mentioned:
1823 # presumably late evening, as below), and would run until &quot;the end of
1824 # the summer&quot;.  The discrepancy between municipal time and railroad
1825 # time was noted.
1826 
1827 # From Paul Eggert (2003-07-27):
1828 # Willett (1914-03) notes that DST &quot;has been in operation ... in the
1829 # City of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, for one year.&quot;

1833 # Some western towns (e.g. Swift Current) switched from MST/MDT to CST in 1972.
1834 # Other western towns (e.g. Lloydminster) are like Edmonton.
1835 # Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Denare Beach and Creighton
1836 # are like Winnipeg, in violation of Saskatchewan law.

1838 # From W. Jones (1992-11-06):
1839 # The. . .below is based on information I got from our law library, the

1844 # Saskatchewan is split by a time zone meridian (105W) and over the years
1845 # the boundary became pretty ragged as communities near it reevaluated

2467 
2468 # From Arthur David Olson (2001-01-25):
2469 # The 2001-01-24 traditional Washington Post contained the page one
2470 # story &quot;Timely Issue Divides Mexicans.&quot;...
2471 # http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37383-2001Jan23.html
2472 # ... Mexico City Mayor López Obrador &quot;...is threatening to keep
2473 # Mexico City and its 20 million residents on a different time than
2474 # the rest of the country...&quot; In particular, López Obrador would abolish
2475 # observation of Daylight Saving Time.
2476 
2477 # Official statute published by the Energy Department
2478 # http://www.conae.gob.mx/ahorro/decretohorver2001.html#decre
2479 # (2001-02-01) shows Baja and Chihauhua as still using US DST rules,
2480 # and Sonora with no DST.  This was reported by Jesper Nørgaard (2001-02-03).
2481 
2482 # From Paul Eggert (2001-03-03):
2483 #
<span class="line-modified">2484 # http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/20010303/t000018766.html</span>
2485 # James F. Smith writes in today&#39;s LA Times
2486 # * Sonora will continue to observe standard time.
2487 # * Last week Mexico City&#39;s mayor Andrés Manuel López Obrador decreed that
2488 #   the Federal District will not adopt DST.
2489 # * 4 of 16 district leaders announced they&#39;ll ignore the decree.
2490 # * The decree does not affect federal-controlled facilities including
2491 #   the airport, banks, hospitals, and schools.
2492 #
2493 # For now we&#39;ll assume that the Federal District will bow to federal rules.
2494 
2495 # From Jesper Nørgaard (2001-04-01):
2496 # I found some references to the Mexican application of daylight
2497 # saving, which modifies what I had already sent you, stating earlier
2498 # that a number of northern Mexican states would go on daylight
2499 # saving. The modification reverts this to only cover Baja California
2500 # (Norte), while all other states (except Sonora, who has no daylight
2501 # saving all year) will follow the original decree of president
2502 # Vicente Fox, starting daylight saving May 6, 2001 and ending
2503 # September 30, 2001.

 114 # Shanks says that DST was called &quot;War Time&quot; in the US in 1918 and 1919.
 115 # However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which
 116 # was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently
 117 # time was just called &quot;Standard Time&quot; or &quot;Daylight Saving Time&quot;.

 595 # Howse writes that Alaska switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar,
 596 # and from east-of-GMT to west-of-GMT days, when the US bought it from Russia.
 597 # On Friday, 1867-10-18 (Gregorian), at precisely 15:30 local time, the
 598 # Russian forts and fleet at Sitka fired salutes to mark the ceremony of
 599 # formal transfer.  See the Sacramento Daily Union (1867-11-14), p 3, col 2.

 601 # Sitka workers did not change their calendars until Sunday, 1867-10-20,
 602 # and so celebrated two Sundays that week.  See: Ahllund T (tr Hallamaa P).

 830 # Between 1944-01-01 and 1944-04-01 the State of Arizona used standard
 831 # time, but by federal law railroads, airlines, bus lines, military
 832 # personnel, and some engaged in interstate commerce continued to
 833 # observe war (i.e., daylight saving) time.  The 1944-03-17 Phoenix
 834 # Gazette says that was the date the law changed, and that 04-01 was
 835 # the date the state&#39;s clocks would change.  In 1945 the State of
 836 # Arizona used standard time all year, again with exceptions only as
 837 # mandated by federal law.  Arizona observed DST in 1967, but Arizona
 838 # Laws 1968, ch. 183 (effective 1968-03-21) repealed DST.

1122 # (1999-01-29) via WKYM-101.7:
1123 # Clinton County has joined Wayne County in asking the DoT to change from
1124 # the Central to the Eastern time zone....  The Wayne County government made
1125 # the same request in December.  And while Russell County officials have not

1176 # From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
1177 # Shanks writes that Michigan started using standard time on 1885-09-18,
1178 # but Howse writes (pp 124-125, referring to Popular Astronomy, 1901-01)
1179 # that Detroit kept
1180 #
1181 #	local time until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should
1182 #	be put back twenty-eight minutes to Central Standard Time.  Half the
1183 #	city obeyed, half refused.  After considerable debate, the decision
1184 #	was rescinded and the city reverted to Sun time.  A derisive offer to
1185 #	erect a sundial in front of the city hall was referred to the
1186 #	Committee on Sewers.  Then, in 1905, Central time was adopted
1187 #	by city vote.
1188 #
1189 # This story is too entertaining to be false, so go with Howse over Shanks.
