  36 # Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
  37 # Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
  38 # San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
  39 # Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
  40 #
  41 # Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
  42 # for time zone data was the International Air Transport
  43 # Association&#39;s Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
  44 # published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
  45 # of the IATA&#39;s data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
  46 # IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
  47 #
  48 # Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
  49 # Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
  50 # I found in the UCLA library.
  51 #
  52 # For data circa 1899, a common source is:
  53 # Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899 Feb;13(2):173-94.
  54 # https://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359
  55 #
  56 # For Russian data circa 1919, a source is:
  57 # Byalokoz EL. New Counting of Time in Russia since July 1, 1919.
  58 # (See the &#39;europe&#39; file for a fuller citation.)

 116 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):

 118 # in spring 1991, then to 4:00 with no DST in fall 1995, then
 119 # readopting Russian DST in 1997.  Go with Shanks &amp; Pottenger, even
 120 # when they disagree with others.  Edgar Der-Danieliantz
 121 # reported (1996-05-04) that Yerevan probably wouldn&#39;t use DST
 122 # in 1996, though it did use DST in 1995.  IATA SSIM (1991/1998) reports that
 123 # Armenia switched from 3:00 to 4:00 in 1998 and observed DST after 1991,
 124 # but started switching at 3:00s in 1998.
 125 
 126 # From Arthur David Olson (2011-06-15):
 127 # While Russia abandoned DST in 2011, Armenia may choose to
 128 # follow Russia&#39;s &quot;old&quot; rules.

 571 # Xinjiang Time is well-documented as being officially recognized.  E.g., see

 573 # &lt;http://www.sinkiang.gov.cn/service/ourworking/&gt; (2014-04-22).
 574 # Unfortunately, we have no good records of time in Xinjiang before 1986.
 575 # During the 20th century parts of Xinjiang were ruled by the Qing dynasty,
 576 # the Republic of China, various warlords, the First and Second East Turkestan
 577 # Republics, the Soviet Union, the Kuomintang, and the People&#39;s Republic of
 578 # China, and tracking down all these organizations&#39; timekeeping rules would be
 579 # quite a trick.  Approximate this lost history by a transition from LMT to
 580 # UT +06 at the start of 1928, the year of accession of the warlord Jin Shuren,
 581 # which happens to be the date given by Shanks &amp; Pottenger (no doubt as a
 582 # guess) as the transition from LMT.  Ignore the usage of +08 before
 583 # 1986-02-01 under the theory that the transition date to +08 is unknown and
 584 # that the sort of users who prefer Asia/Urumqi now typically ignored the
 585 # +08 mandate back then.

1170 # Normally the tz database uses English-language abbreviations, but in
1171 # Indonesia it&#39;s typical to use Indonesian-language abbreviations even
1172 # when writing in English.  For example, see the English-language
1173 # summary published by the Time and Frequency Laboratory of the
1174 # Research Center for Calibration, Instrumentation and Metrology,
1175 # Indonesia, &lt;http://time.kim.lipi.go.id/time-eng.php&gt; (2006-09-29).
1176 # The time zone abbreviations and UT offsets are:

1233 #	for synchronizing the official times of the country, agreed that:
1234 #
1235 #	The official time of the country will should move forward one hour
1236 #	at the 24[:00] hours of the first day of Farvardin and should return
1237 #	to its previous state at the 24[:00] hours of the 30th day of
1238 #	Shahrivar.
1239 #
1240 #	First Deputy to the President - Hassan Habibi
1241 #
1242 # From personal experience, that agrees with what has been followed
1243 # for at least the last 5 years.  Before that, for a few years, the
1244 # date used was the first Thursday night of Farvardin and the last
1245 # Thursday night of Shahrivar, but I can&#39;t give exact dates....
1246 #
1247 # From Roozbeh Pournader (2005-04-05):
1248 # The text of the Iranian law, in effect since 1925, clearly mentions
1249 # that the true solar year is the measure, and there is no arithmetic
1250 # leap year calculation involved.  There has never been any serious
1251 # plan to change that law....

1254 # Go with Shanks &amp; Pottenger before Sept. 1991, and with Pournader thereafter.
<span class="line-modified">1255 # I used Ed Reingold&#39;s cal-persia in GNU Emacs 21.2 to check Persian dates,</span>
<span class="line-modified">1256 # stopping after 2037 when 32-bit time_t&#39;s overflow.</span>
<span class="line-modified">1257 # That cal-persia used Birashk&#39;s approximation, which disagrees with the solar</span>
<span class="line-modified">1258 # calendar predictions for the year 2025, so I corrected those dates by hand.</span>





















































1259 #
1260 # From Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-03-30), writing about future
1261 # discrepancies between cal-persia and the Iranian calendar:
1262 # For 2091 solar-longitude-after yields 2091-03-20 08:40:07.7 UT for
1263 # the vernal equinox and that gets so close to 12:00 some local
1264 # Iranian time that the definition of the correct location needs to be
1265 # known exactly, amongst other factors.  2157 is even closer:
1266 # 2157-03-20 08:37:15.5 UT.  But the Gregorian year 2025 should give
1267 # no interpretation problem whatsoever.  By the way, another instant
1268 # in the near future where there will be a discrepancy between
1269 # arithmetical and astronomical Iranian calendars will be in 2058:
1270 # vernal equinox on 2058-03-20 09:03:05.9 UT.  The Java version of
1271 # Reingold&#39;s/Dershowitz&#39; calculator gives correctly the Gregorian date
1272 # 2058-03-21 for 1 Farvardin 1437 (astronomical).
1273 #
1274 # From Steffen Thorsen (2006-03-22):
1275 # Several of my users have reported that Iran will not observe DST anymore:
1276 # http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-17/0603193812164948.htm
1277 #
1278 # From Reuters (2007-09-16), with a heads-up from Jesper Nørgaard Welen:

1285 # Iran, Volume 63, No. 18242, dated Tuesday 1386/6/24

1360 # An article in this week&#39;s Economist (&quot;Inside the Saddam-free zone&quot;, p. 50 in
1361 # the U.S. edition) on the Iraqi Kurds contains a paragraph:
1362 # &quot;The three northern provinces ... switched their clocks this spring and
1363 # are an hour ahead of Baghdad.&quot;
1364 #
1365 # But Rives McDow (2000-06-18) quotes a contact in Iraqi-Kurdistan as follows:
1366 # In the past, some Kurdish nationalists, as a protest to the Iraqi
1367 # Government, did not adhere to daylight saving time.  They referred
1368 # to daylight saving as Saddam time.  But, as of today, the time zone
1369 # in Iraqi-Kurdistan is on standard time with Baghdad, Iraq.

1823 # &lt;http://www.kazsociety.org.uk/news/2005/03/30.htm&gt; (2005-03-21):
1824 # The Government of Kazakhstan passed a resolution March 15 abolishing
1825 # daylight saving time citing lack of economic benefits and health
1826 # complications coupled with a decrease in productivity.
1827 #
1828 # From Branislav Kojic (in Astana) via Gwillim Law (2005-06-28):
1829 # ... what happened was that the former Kazakhstan Eastern time zone
1830 # was &quot;blended&quot; with the Central zone.  Therefore, Kazakhstan now has
1831 # two time zones, and difference between them is one hour.  The zone
1832 # closer to UTC is the former Western zone (probably still called the
1833 # same), encompassing four provinces in the west: Aqtöbe, Atyraū,
1834 # Mangghystaū, and West Kazakhstan.  The other zone encompasses
1835 # everything else....  I guess that would make Kazakhstan time zones
1836 # de jure UTC+5 and UTC+6 respectively.

1844 # http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&amp;nd=102010545
1845 # removed the extra hour (&quot;decree time&quot;) on the territory of the USSR

1847 # It also allowed (but not mandated) Kazakh SSR, Kirghiz SSR, Tajik SSR,

2610 # From Amos Shapir (1998-02-15):
2611 #
2612 # From 1917 until 1948-05-15, all of Palestine, including the parts now
2613 # known as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, was under British rule.
2614 # Therefore the rules given for Israel for that period, apply there too...
2615 #
2616 # The Gaza Strip was under Egyptian rule between 1948-05-15 until 1967-06-05
2617 # (except a short occupation by Israel from 1956-11 till 1957-03, but no
2618 # time zone was affected then).  It was never formally annexed to Egypt,
2619 # though.

3004 # Saudi Arabia
3005 #
3006 # From Paul Eggert (2018-08-29):
3007 # Time in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian peninsula was not
3008 # standardized until 1968 or so; we don&#39;t know exactly when, and possibly it
3009 # has never been made official.  Richard P Hunt, in &quot;Islam city yielding to
3010 # modern times&quot;, New York Times (1961-04-09), p 20, wrote that only airlines
3011 # observed standard time, and that people in Jeddah mostly observed quasi-solar
3012 # time, doing so by setting their watches at sunrise to 6 o&#39;clock (or to 12
3013 # o&#39;clock for &quot;Arab&quot; time).
3014 #
3015 # Timekeeping differed depending on who you were and which part of Saudi
3016 # Arabia you were in.  In 1969, Elias Antar wrote that although a common
3017 # practice had been to set one&#39;s watch to 12:00 (i.e., midnight) at sunset -
3018 # which meant that the time on one side of a mountain could differ greatly from
3019 # the time on the other side - many foreigners set their watches to 6pm
3020 # instead, while airlines instead used UTC +03 (except in Dhahran, where they
3021 # used UTC +04), Aramco used UTC +03 with DST, and the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line
3022 # Company used Aramco time in eastern Saudi Arabia and airline time in western.
3023 # (The American Military Aid Advisory Group used plain UTC.)  Antar writes,
3024 # &quot;A man named Higgins, so the story goes, used to run a local power
3025 # station. One day, the whole thing became too much for Higgins and he
3026 # assembled his staff and laid down the law. &#39;I&#39;ve had enough of this,&#39; he
3027 # shrieked. &#39;It is now 12 o&#39;clock Higgins Time, and from now on this station is
3028 # going to run on Higgins Time.&#39; And so, until last year, it did.&quot;  See:
3029 # Antar E. Dinner at When? Saudi Aramco World, 1969 March/April. 2-3.
3030 # http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/196902/dinner.at.when.htm
<span class="line-modified">3031 # newspapers.com says a similar story about Higgins was published in the Port</span>
<span class="line-modified">3032 # Angeles (WA) Evening News, 1965-03-10, page 5, but I lack access to the text.</span>
3033 #
3034 # The TZ database cannot represent quasi-solar time; airline time is the best
3035 # we can do.  The 1946 foreign air news digest of the U.S. Civil Aeronautics
3036 # Board (OCLC 42299995) reported that the &quot;... Arabian Government, inaugurated
3037 # a weekly Dhahran-Cairo service, via the Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and
3038 # Jidda, on March 14, 1947&quot;.  Shanks &amp; Pottenger guessed 1950; go with the
3039 # earlier date.
3040 #
3041 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger also state that until 1968-05-01 Saudi Arabia had two
3042 # time zones; the other zone, at UT +04, was in the far eastern part of
3043 # the country.  Presumably this is documenting airline time.  Ignore this,
3044 # as it&#39;s before our 1970 cutoff.

3361 # and is the basis for the information below.
3362 #
3363 # The 1906 transition was effective July 1 and standardized Indochina to
3364 # Phù Liễn Observatory, legally 104° 17&#39; 17&quot; east of Paris.
3365 # It&#39;s unclear whether this meant legal Paris Mean Time (00:09:21) or
3366 # the Paris Meridian (2° 20&#39; 14.03&quot; E); the former yields 07:06:30.1333...
3367 # and the latter 07:06:29.333... so either way it rounds to 07:06:30,
3368 # which is used below even though the modern-day Phù Liễn Observatory
3369 # is closer to 07:06:31.  Abbreviate Phù Liễn Mean Time as PLMT.
3370 #
3371 # The following transitions occurred in Indochina in general (before 1954)
3372 # and in South Vietnam in particular (after 1954):
3373 # To 07:00 on 1911-05-01.

  36 # Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
  37 # Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
  38 # San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
  39 # Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
  40 #
  41 # Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
  42 # for time zone data was the International Air Transport
  43 # Association&#39;s Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
  44 # published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
  45 # of the IATA&#39;s data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
  46 # IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
  47 #
  48 # Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
  49 # Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
  50 # I found in the UCLA library.
  51 #
  52 # For data circa 1899, a common source is:

 119 # readopting Russian DST in 1997.  Go with Shanks &amp; Pottenger, even

 318 # Also, the table lists the planned end of DST in 1949, but the corresponding
 319 # zone line cuts this off on May 28, when the Communists took power.

 571 # Xinjiang Time is well-documented as being officially recognized.  E.g., see
 572 # &quot;The Working-Calendar for The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government&quot;
 573 # &lt;http://www.sinkiang.gov.cn/service/ourworking/&gt; (2014-04-22).
 574 # Unfortunately, we have no good records of time in Xinjiang before 1986.
 575 # During the 20th century parts of Xinjiang were ruled by the Qing dynasty,
 576 # the Republic of China, various warlords, the First and Second East Turkestan
 577 # Republics, the Soviet Union, the Kuomintang, and the People&#39;s Republic of
 578 # China, and tracking down all these organizations&#39; timekeeping rules would be
 579 # quite a trick.  Approximate this lost history by a transition from LMT to
 580 # UT +06 at the start of 1928, the year of accession of the warlord Jin Shuren,
 581 # which happens to be the date given by Shanks &amp; Pottenger (no doubt as a
 582 # guess) as the transition from LMT.  Ignore the usage of +08 before
 583 # 1986-02-01 under the theory that the transition date to +08 is unknown and
 584 # that the sort of users who prefer Asia/Urumqi now typically ignored the
 585 # +08 mandate back then.

 602 # From Lee Yiu Chung (2009-10-24):
 603 # I found there are some mistakes for the...DST rule for Hong
 604 # Kong. [According] to the DST record from Hong Kong Observatory (actually,
 605 # it is not [an] observatory, but the official meteorological agency of HK,
 606 # and also serves as the official timing agency), there are some missing
 607 # and incorrect rules. Although the exact switch over time is missing, I
 608 # think 3:30 is correct. The official DST record for Hong Kong can be

1426 # From Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-03-30), writing about future
1427 # discrepancies between cal-persia and the Iranian calendar:
1428 # For 2091 solar-longitude-after yields 2091-03-20 08:40:07.7 UT for
1429 # the vernal equinox and that gets so close to 12:00 some local
1430 # Iranian time that the definition of the correct location needs to be
1431 # known exactly, amongst other factors.  2157 is even closer:
1432 # 2157-03-20 08:37:15.5 UT.  But the Gregorian year 2025 should give
1433 # no interpretation problem whatsoever.  By the way, another instant
1434 # in the near future where there will be a discrepancy between
1435 # arithmetical and astronomical Iranian calendars will be in 2058:
1436 # vernal equinox on 2058-03-20 09:03:05.9 UT.  The Java version of
1437 # Reingold&#39;s/Dershowitz&#39; calculator gives correctly the Gregorian date
1438 # 2058-03-21 for 1 Farvardin 1437 (astronomical).

1578 # An article in this week&#39;s Economist (&quot;Inside the Saddam-free zone&quot;, p. 50 in
1579 # the U.S. edition) on the Iraqi Kurds contains a paragraph:
1580 # &quot;The three northern provinces ... switched their clocks this spring and
1581 # are an hour ahead of Baghdad.&quot;
1582 #
1583 # But Rives McDow (2000-06-18) quotes a contact in Iraqi-Kurdistan as follows:
1584 # In the past, some Kurdish nationalists, as a protest to the Iraqi
1585 # Government, did not adhere to daylight saving time.  They referred
1586 # to daylight saving as Saddam time.  But, as of today, the time zone
1587 # in Iraqi-Kurdistan is on standard time with Baghdad, Iraq.

2053 # closer to UTC is the former Western zone (probably still called the
2054 # same), encompassing four provinces in the west: Aqtöbe, Atyraū,
2055 # Mangghystaū, and West Kazakhstan.  The other zone encompasses

3268 # Saudi Arabia
3269 #
3270 # From Paul Eggert (2018-08-29):
3271 # Time in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian peninsula was not
3272 # standardized until 1968 or so; we don&#39;t know exactly when, and possibly it
3273 # has never been made official.  Richard P Hunt, in &quot;Islam city yielding to
3274 # modern times&quot;, New York Times (1961-04-09), p 20, wrote that only airlines
3275 # observed standard time, and that people in Jeddah mostly observed quasi-solar
3276 # time, doing so by setting their watches at sunrise to 6 o&#39;clock (or to 12
3277 # o&#39;clock for &quot;Arab&quot; time).
3278 #
3279 # Timekeeping differed depending on who you were and which part of Saudi
3280 # Arabia you were in.  In 1969, Elias Antar wrote that although a common
3281 # practice had been to set one&#39;s watch to 12:00 (i.e., midnight) at sunset -
3282 # which meant that the time on one side of a mountain could differ greatly from
3283 # the time on the other side - many foreigners set their watches to 6pm
3284 # instead, while airlines instead used UTC +03 (except in Dhahran, where they
3285 # used UTC +04), Aramco used UTC +03 with DST, and the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line
3286 # Company used Aramco time in eastern Saudi Arabia and airline time in western.
3287 # (The American Military Aid Advisory Group used plain UTC.)  Antar writes,
3288 # &quot;A man named Higgins, so the story goes, used to run a local power
3289 # station. One day, the whole thing became too much for Higgins and he
3290 # assembled his staff and laid down the law. &#39;I&#39;ve had enough of this,&#39; he
3291 # shrieked. &#39;It is now 12 o&#39;clock Higgins Time, and from now on this station is
3292 # going to run on Higgins Time.&#39; And so, until last year, it did.&quot;  See:
3293 # Antar E. Dinner at When? Saudi Aramco World, 1969 March/April. 2-3.

<span class="line-modified">3296 # Port Angeles (WA) Evening News. 1965-03-10. page 3.</span>
3297 #
3298 # The TZ database cannot represent quasi-solar time; airline time is the best
3299 # we can do.  The 1946 foreign air news digest of the U.S. Civil Aeronautics
3300 # Board (OCLC 42299995) reported that the &quot;... Arabian Government, inaugurated
3301 # a weekly Dhahran-Cairo service, via the Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and
3302 # Jidda, on March 14, 1947&quot;.  Shanks &amp; Pottenger guessed 1950; go with the
3303 # earlier date.
3304 #
3305 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger also state that until 1968-05-01 Saudi Arabia had two
3306 # time zones; the other zone, at UT +04, was in the far eastern part of
3307 # the country.  Presumably this is documenting airline time.  Ignore this,
3308 # as it&#39;s before our 1970 cutoff.

3381 # switch to &quot;SLST&quot; if it catches on.

3625 # and is the basis for the information below.
3626 #
3627 # The 1906 transition was effective July 1 and standardized Indochina to
3628 # Phù Liễn Observatory, legally 104° 17&#39; 17&quot; east of Paris.
3629 # It&#39;s unclear whether this meant legal Paris Mean Time (00:09:21) or
3630 # the Paris Meridian (2° 20&#39; 14.03&quot; E); the former yields 07:06:30.1333...
3631 # and the latter 07:06:29.333... so either way it rounds to 07:06:30,
3632 # which is used below even though the modern-day Phù Liễn Observatory
3633 # is closer to 07:06:31.  Abbreviate Phù Liễn Mean Time as PLMT.
3634 #
3635 # The following transitions occurred in Indochina in general (before 1954)
3636 # and in South Vietnam in particular (after 1954):
3637 # To 07:00 on 1911-05-01.
