 85      *
 86      * &lt;P&gt; {@code level 0} - Prevents the interleaving of any messages. This
 87      * means that when a partial delivery begins, no other messages will be
 88      * received except the message being partially delivered. If another message
 89      * arrives on a different stream (or association) that could be delivered,
 90      * it will be blocked waiting for the user to read all of the partially
 91      * delivered message.
 92      *
 93      * &lt;P&gt; {@code level 1} - Allows interleaving of messages that are from
 94      * different associations. For {@code SctpChannel}, level 0 and
 95      * level 1 have the same meaning since an {@code SctpChannel} always
 96      * receives messages from the same association. Note that setting an {@code
 97      * SctpMultiChannel} to this level may cause multiple partial
 98      * delivers from different associations but for any given association, only
 99      * one message will be delivered until all parts of a message have been
100      * delivered. This means that one large message, being read with an
101      * association identification of &quot;X&quot;, will block other messages from
102      * association &quot;X&quot; from being delivered.
103      *
104      * &lt;P&gt; {@code level 2} - Allows complete interleaving of messages. This
105      * level requires that the sender carefully observe not only the peer
106      * {@code Association} but also must pay careful attention to the stream
107      * number. With this option enabled a partially delivered message may begin
108      * being delivered for association &quot;X&quot; stream &quot;Y&quot; and the next subsequent
109      * receive may return a message from association &quot;X&quot; stream &quot;Z&quot;. Note that
110      * no other messages would be delivered for association &quot;X&quot; stream &quot;Y&quot;
111      * until all of stream &quot;Y&quot;&#39;s partially delivered message was read.
112      * Note that this option effects both channel types.  Also note that
113      * for an {@code SctpMultiChannel} not only may another streams
114      * message from the same association be delivered from the next receive,
115      * some other associations message may be delivered upon the next receive.
