 39  * A selectable channel for message-oriented SCTP sockets.
 40  *
 41  * &lt;P&gt; An SCTP multi channel supports many associations on a single socket.
 42  * An {@code SctpMultiChannel} is created by invoking the
 43  * {@link #open open} method of this class. A newly-created channel is open but
 44  * not yet bound. An attempt to invoke the {@link #receive receive} method of an
 45  * unbound channel will cause the {@link NotYetBoundException}
 46  * to be thrown. An attempt to invoke the {@link #send send} method of an
 47  * unbound channel will cause it to first invoke the {@link #bind bind} method.
 48  * The address(es) that the channel&#39;s socket is bound to can be retrieved by
 49  * calling {@link #getAllLocalAddresses getAllLocalAddresses}.
 50  *
 51  * &lt;P&gt; Messages may be sent and received without explicitly setting up an
 52  * association with the remote peer. The channel will implicitly setup
 53  * a new association whenever it sends or receives a message from a remote
 54  * peer if there is not already an association with that peer. Upon successful
 55  * association setup, an {@link AssociationChangeNotification
 56  * association changed} notification will be put to the SCTP stack with its
 57  * {@code event} parameter set to {@link
 58  * AssociationChangeNotification.AssocChangeEvent#COMM_UP
 59  * COMM_UP}. This notification can be received by invoking {@link #receive
 60  * receive}.
 61  *
 62  * &lt;P&gt; Socket options are configured using the
 63  * {@link #setOption(SctpSocketOption,Object,Association) setOption} method. An
 64  * {@code SctpMultiChannel} supports the following options:
 65  * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 66  * &lt;table class=&quot;striped&quot;&gt;
 67  *   &lt;caption style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;Socket options&lt;/caption&gt;
