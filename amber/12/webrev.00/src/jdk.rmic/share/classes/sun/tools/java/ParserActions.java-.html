31  * This is the protocol by which a Parser makes callbacks
32  * to the later phases of the compiler.
33  * &lt;p&gt;
34  * (As a backwards compatibility trick, Parser implements
35  * this protocol, so that an instance of a Parser subclass
36  * can handle its own actions.  The preferred way to use a
37  * Parser, however, is to instantiate it directly with a
38  * reference to your own ParserActions implementation.)
