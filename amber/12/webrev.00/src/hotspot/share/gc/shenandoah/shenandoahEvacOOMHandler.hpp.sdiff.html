 36  * necessarily follow we can return immediately from the LRB (and store to from-space).

 40  * because other threads might still have space in their GCLABs, and successfully
 41  * evacuate the object.

 44  * thread A is stuck waiting for the evacuation to be over -- it cannot leave with
 45  * from-space copy yet. Control thread drops evacuation_in_progress preparing for
 46  * next STW phase that has to recover from OOME. Thread B misses that update, and
