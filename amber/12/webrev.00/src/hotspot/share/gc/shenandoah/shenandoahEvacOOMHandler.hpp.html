 33  * Provides safe handling of out-of-memory situations during evacuation.
 34  *
 35  * When a Java thread encounters out-of-memory while evacuating an object in a
 36  * load-reference-barrier (i.e. it cannot copy the object to to-space), it does not
 37  * necessarily follow we can return immediately from the LRB (and store to from-space).
 38  *
 39  * In very basic case, on such failure we may wait until the the evacuation is over,
 40  * and then resolve the forwarded copy, and to the store there. This is possible
 41  * because other threads might still have space in their GCLABs, and successfully
 42  * evacuate the object.
 43  *
 44  * But, there is a race due to non-atomic evac_in_progress transition. Consider
 45  * thread A is stuck waiting for the evacuation to be over -- it cannot leave with
 46  * from-space copy yet. Control thread drops evacuation_in_progress preparing for
 47  * next STW phase that has to recover from OOME. Thread B misses that update, and
 48  * successfully evacuates the object, does the write to to-copy. But, before
 49  * Thread B is able to install the fwdptr, thread A discovers evac_in_progress is
 50  * down, exits from here, reads the fwdptr, discovers old from-copy, and stores there.
 51  * Thread B then wakes up and installs to-copy. This breaks to-space invariant, and
 52  * silently corrupts the heap: we accepted two writes to separate copies of the object.
 53  *
 54  * The way it is solved here is to maintain a counter of threads inside the
 55  * &#39;evacuation path&#39;. The &#39;evacuation path&#39; is the part of evacuation that does the actual
 56  * allocation, copying and CASing of the copy object, and is protected by this
 57  * OOM-during-evac-handler. The handler allows multiple threads to enter and exit
 58  * evacuation path, but on OOME it requires all threads that experienced OOME to wait
 59  * for current threads to leave, and blocks other threads from entering.
 60  *
 61  * Detailed state change:
 62  *
 63  * Upon entry of the evac-path, entering thread will attempt to increase the counter,
 64  * using a CAS. Depending on the result of the CAS:
 65  * - success: carry on with evac
 66  * - failure:
 67  *   - if offending value is a valid counter, then try again
 68  *   - if offending value is OOM-during-evac special value: loop until
 69  *     counter drops to 0, then exit with resolving the ptr
 70  *
 71  * Upon exit, exiting thread will decrease the counter using atomic dec.
 72  *
 73  * Upon OOM-during-evac, any thread will attempt to CAS OOM-during-evac
 74  * special value into the counter. Depending on result:
 75  *   - success: busy-loop until counter drops to zero, then exit with resolve
 76  *   - failure:
 77  *     - offender is valid counter update: try again
 78  *     - offender is OOM-during-evac: busy loop until counter drops to
 79  *       zero, then exit with resolve
