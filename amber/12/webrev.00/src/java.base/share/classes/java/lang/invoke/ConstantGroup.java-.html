 32 /**
 33  * An ordered sequence of constants, some of which may not yet
 34  * be present.  This type is used by {@link BootstrapCallInfo}
 35  * to represent the sequence of bootstrap arguments associated
 36  * with a bootstrap method, without forcing their immediate
 37  * resolution.
 38  * &lt;p&gt;
 39  * If you use the
 40  * {@linkplain ConstantGroup#get(int) simple get method},
 41  * the constant will be resolved, if this has not already
 42  * happened.  An occasional side effect of resolution is a
 43  * {@code LinkageError}, which happens if the system
 44  * could not resolve the constant in question.
 45  * &lt;p&gt;
 46  * In order to peek at a constant without necessarily
 47  * resolving it, use the
 48  * {@linkplain ConstantGroup#get(int,Object)
 49  * non-throwing get method}.
 50  * This method will never throw a resolution error.
 51  * Instead, if the resolution would result in an error,
 52  * or if the implementation elects not to attempt
 53  * resolution at this point, then the method will
 54  * return the user-supplied sentinel value.
 55  * &lt;p&gt;
 56  * To iterate through the constants, resolving as you go,
 57  * use the iterator provided on the {@link List}-typed view.
 58  * If you supply a sentinel, resolution will be suppressed.
 59  * &lt;p&gt;
 60  * Typically the constant is drawn from a constant pool entry
 61  * in the virtual machine. Constant pool entries undergo a
 62  * one-time state transition from unresolved to resolved,
 63  * with a permanently recorded result.  Usually that result
 64  * is the desired constant value, but it may also be an error.
 65  * In any case, the results displayed by a {@code ConstantGroup}
 66  * are stable in the same way.  If a query to a particular
 67  * constant in a {@code ConstantGroup} throws an exception once,
 68  * it will throw the same kind of exception forever after.
 69  * If the query returns a constant value once, it will return
 70  * the same value forever after.
 71  * &lt;p&gt;
 72  * The only possible change in the status of a constant is
 73  * from the unresolved to the resolved state, and that
 74  * happens exactly once.  A constant will never revert to
 75  * an unlinked state.  However, from the point of view of
 76  * this interface, constants may appear to spontaneously
 77  * resolve.  This is so because constant pools are global
 78  * structures shared across threads, and because
 79  * prefetching of some constants may occur, there are no
 80  * strong guarantees when the virtual machine may resolve
 81  * constants.
 82  * &lt;p&gt;
 83  * When choosing sentinel values, be aware that a constant
 84  * pool which has {@code CONSTANT_Dynamic} entries
 85  * can contain potentially any representable value,
 86  * and arbitrary implementations of {@code ConstantGroup}
 87  * are also free to produce arbitrary values.
 88  * This means some obvious choices for sentinel values,
 89  * such as {@code null}, may sometimes fail to distinguish
 90  * a resolved from an unresolved constant in the group.
 91  * The most reliable sentinel is a privately created object,
 92  * or perhaps the {@code ConstantGroup} itself.
