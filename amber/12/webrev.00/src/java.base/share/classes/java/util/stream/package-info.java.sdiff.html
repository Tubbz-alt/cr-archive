302  * &lt;p&gt;The ordering of side-effects may be surprising.  Even when a pipeline is
303  * constrained to produce a &lt;em&gt;result&lt;/em&gt; that is consistent with the
304  * encounter order of the stream source (for example,
305  * {@code IntStream.range(0,5).parallel().map(x -&gt; x*2).toArray()}
306  * must produce {@code [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]}), no guarantees are made as to the order
307  * in which the mapper function is applied to individual elements, or in what
308  * thread any behavioral parameter is executed for a given element.
309  *
310  * &lt;p&gt;The eliding of side-effects may also be surprising.  With the exception of
311  * terminal operations {@link java.util.stream.Stream#forEach forEach} and
312  * {@link java.util.stream.Stream#forEachOrdered forEachOrdered}, side-effects
313  * of behavioral parameters may not always be executed when the stream
314  * implementation can optimize away the execution of behavioral parameters
315  * without affecting the result of the computation.  (For a specific example
316  * see the API note documented on the {@link java.util.stream.Stream#count count}
317  * operation.)
318  *
<span class="line-modified">319  * &lt;p&gt;Many computations where one might be tempted to use side effects can be more</span>
320  * safely and efficiently expressed without side-effects, such as using
321  * &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#Reduction&quot;&gt;reduction&lt;/a&gt; instead of mutable
322  * accumulators. However, side-effects such as using {@code println()} for debugging
323  * purposes are usually harmless.  A small number of stream operations, such as
324  * {@code forEach()} and {@code peek()}, can operate only via side-effects;
325  * these should be used with care.
326  *
327  * &lt;p&gt;As an example of how to transform a stream pipeline that inappropriately
328  * uses side-effects to one that does not, the following code searches a stream
329  * of strings for those matching a given regular expression, and puts the
330  * matches in a list.
331  *
332  * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
333  *     ArrayList&lt;String&gt; results = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
334  *     stream.filter(s -&gt; pattern.matcher(s).matches())
335  *           .forEach(s -&gt; results.add(s));  // Unnecessary use of side-effects!
336  * }&lt;/pre&gt;
337  *
338  * This code unnecessarily uses side-effects.  If executed in parallel, the
339  * non-thread-safety of {@code ArrayList} would cause incorrect results, and

428  *
429  * &lt;p&gt;These reduction operations can run safely in parallel with almost no
430  * modification:
431  * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
432  *    int sum = numbers.parallelStream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
433  * }&lt;/pre&gt;
434  *
435  * &lt;p&gt;Reduction parallellizes well because the implementation
436  * can operate on subsets of the data in parallel, and then combine the
437  * intermediate results to get the final correct answer.  (Even if the language
438  * had a &quot;parallel for-each&quot; construct, the mutative accumulation approach would
439  * still required the developer to provide
440  * thread-safe updates to the shared accumulating variable {@code sum}, and
441  * the required synchronization would then likely eliminate any performance gain from
442  * parallelism.)  Using {@code reduce()} instead removes all of the
443  * burden of parallelizing the reduction operation, and the library can provide
444  * an efficient parallel implementation with no additional synchronization
445  * required.
446  *
447  * &lt;p&gt;The &quot;widgets&quot; examples shown earlier shows how reduction combines with
<span class="line-modified">448  * other operations to replace for loops with bulk operations.  If {@code widgets}</span>
449  * is a collection of {@code Widget} objects, which have a {@code getWeight} method,
450  * we can find the heaviest widget with:
451  * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
452  *     OptionalInt heaviest = widgets.parallelStream()
453  *                                   .mapToInt(Widget::getWeight)
454  *                                   .max();
455  * }&lt;/pre&gt;
456  *
457  * &lt;p&gt;In its more general form, a {@code reduce} operation on elements of type
458  * {@code &lt;T&gt;} yielding a result of type {@code &lt;U&gt;} requires three parameters:
459  * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
460  * &lt;U&gt; U reduce(U identity,
461  *              BiFunction&lt;U, ? super T, U&gt; accumulator,
462  *              BinaryOperator&lt;U&gt; combiner);
463  * }&lt;/pre&gt;
464  * Here, the &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; element is both an initial seed value for the reduction
465  * and a default result if there are no input elements. The &lt;em&gt;accumulator&lt;/em&gt;
466  * function takes a partial result and the next element, and produces a new
467  * partial result. The &lt;em&gt;combiner&lt;/em&gt; function combines two partial results
468  * to produce a new partial result.  (The combiner is necessary in parallel

712  * spliterator, nearly all of which are tradeoffs between simplicity of
713  * implementation and runtime performance of streams using that spliterator.
714  * The simplest, but least performant, way to create a spliterator is to
715  * create one from an iterator using
716  * {@link java.util.Spliterators#spliteratorUnknownSize(java.util.Iterator, int)}.
717  * While such a spliterator will work, it will likely offer poor parallel
718  * performance, since we have lost sizing information (how big is the
719  * underlying data set), as well as being constrained to a simplistic
720  * splitting algorithm.
721  *
722  * &lt;p&gt;A higher-quality spliterator will provide balanced and known-size
723  * splits, accurate sizing information, and a number of other
724  * {@link java.util.Spliterator#characteristics() characteristics} of the
725  * spliterator or data that can be used by implementations to optimize
726  * execution.
727  *
728  * &lt;p&gt;Spliterators for mutable data sources have an additional challenge;
729  * timing of binding to the data, since the data could change between the time
730  * the spliterator is created and the time the stream pipeline is executed.
731  * Ideally, a spliterator for a stream would report a characteristic of
<span class="line-removed">732 </span>
733  * {@code IMMUTABLE} or {@code CONCURRENT}; if not it should be
734  * &lt;a href=&quot;../Spliterator.html#binding&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;late-binding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If a source
735  * cannot directly supply a recommended spliterator, it may indirectly supply
736  * a spliterator using a {@code Supplier}, and construct a stream via the
737  * {@code Supplier}-accepting versions of
738  * {@link java.util.stream.StreamSupport#stream(Supplier, int, boolean) stream()}.
739  * The spliterator is obtained from the supplier only after the terminal
740  * operation of the stream pipeline commences.
741  *
742  * &lt;p&gt;These requirements significantly reduce the scope of potential
743  * interference between mutations of the stream source and execution of stream
744  * pipelines. Streams based on spliterators with the desired characteristics,
745  * or those using the Supplier-based factory forms, are immune to
746  * modifications of the data source prior to commencement of the terminal
747  * operation (provided the behavioral parameters to the stream operations meet
748  * the required criteria for non-interference and statelessness).  See
749  * &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#NonInterference&quot;&gt;Non-Interference&lt;/a&gt;
