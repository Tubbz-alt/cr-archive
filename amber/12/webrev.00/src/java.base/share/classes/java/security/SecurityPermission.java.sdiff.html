102  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;setPolicy&lt;/th&gt;
103  *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of the system-wide security policy (specifically,
104  * the Policy object)&lt;/td&gt;
105  *   &lt;td&gt;Granting this permission is extremely dangerous, as malicious

120  *   &lt;td&gt;Retrieval of the security property with the specified key&lt;/td&gt;
121  *   &lt;td&gt;Depending on the particular key for which access has
122  * been granted, the code may have access to the list of security
123  * providers, as well as the location of the system-wide and user
124  * security policies.  while revealing this information does not
125  * compromise the security of the system, it does provide malicious

133  *   &lt;td&gt;Setting of the security property with the specified key&lt;/td&gt;
134  *   &lt;td&gt;This could include setting a security provider or defining
135  * the location of the system-wide security policy.  Malicious
136  * code that has permission to set a new security provider may
137  * set a rogue provider that steals confidential information such
138  * as cryptographic private keys. In addition, malicious code with
139  * permission to set the location of the system-wide security policy
140  * may point it to a security policy that grants the attacker
141  * all the necessary permissions it requires to successfully mount
<span class="line-modified">142  * an attack on the system.</span>

148  *   &lt;td&gt;Addition of a new provider&lt;/td&gt;
149  *   &lt;td&gt;This would allow somebody to introduce a possibly
150  * malicious provider (e.g., one that discloses the private keys passed
151  * to it) as the highest-priority provider. This would be possible
152  * because the Security object (which manages the installed providers)
153  * currently does not check the integrity or authenticity of a provider
154  * before attaching it. The &quot;insertProvider&quot; permission subsumes the
155  * &quot;insertProvider.{provider name}&quot; permission (see the section below for
<span class="line-modified">156  * more information).</span>
<span class="line-removed">157  * &lt;/td&gt;</span>

159  *

161  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;removeProvider.{provider name}&lt;/th&gt;
162  *   &lt;td&gt;Removal of the specified provider&lt;/td&gt;
163  *   &lt;td&gt;This may change the behavior or disable execution of other
164  * parts of the program. If a provider subsequently requested by the
165  * program has been removed, execution may fail. Also, if the removed
166  * provider is not explicitly requested by the rest of the program, but
167  * it would normally be the provider chosen when a cryptography service
168  * is requested (due to its previous order in the list of providers),
169  * a different provider will be chosen instead, or no suitable provider
170  * will be found, thereby resulting in program failure.&lt;/td&gt;

172  *
173  * &lt;tr&gt;
174  *   &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;clearProviderProperties.{provider name}&lt;/th&gt;
175  *   &lt;td&gt;&quot;Clearing&quot; of a Provider so that it no longer contains the properties
176  * used to look up services implemented by the provider&lt;/td&gt;
177  *   &lt;td&gt;This disables the lookup of services implemented by the provider.
