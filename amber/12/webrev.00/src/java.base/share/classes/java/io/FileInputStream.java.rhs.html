 33  * A {@code FileInputStream} obtains input bytes
 34  * from a file in a file system. What files
 35  * are  available depends on the host environment.
 36  *
 37  * &lt;p&gt;{@code FileInputStream} is meant for reading streams of raw bytes
 38  * such as image data. For reading streams of characters, consider using
 39  * {@code FileReader}.
 40  *
 41  * @apiNote
 42  * To release resources used by this stream {@link #close} should be called
 43  * directly or by try-with-resources. Subclasses are responsible for the cleanup
 44  * of resources acquired by the subclass.
 45  * Subclasses that override {@link #finalize} in order to perform cleanup
 46  * should be modified to use alternative cleanup mechanisms such as
 47  * {@link java.lang.ref.Cleaner} and remove the overriding {@code finalize} method.
 48  *
 49  * @implSpec
 50  * If this FileInputStream has been subclassed and the {@link #close}
 51  * method has been overridden, the {@link #close} method will be
 52  * called when the FileInputStream is unreachable.
 53  * Otherwise, it is implementation specific how the resource cleanup described in
 54  * {@link #close} is performed.
