 32 /**
 33  * An object to iterate over the entries in a directory. A directory stream
 34  * allows for the convenient use of the for-each construct to iterate over a
 35  * directory.
 36  *
 37  * &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt; While {@code DirectoryStream} extends {@code Iterable}, it is not a
 38  * general-purpose {@code Iterable} as it supports only a single {@code
 39  * Iterator}; invoking the {@link #iterator iterator} method to obtain a second
 40  * or subsequent iterator throws {@code IllegalStateException}. &lt;/b&gt;
 41  *
 42  * &lt;p&gt; An important property of the directory stream&#39;s {@code Iterator} is that
 43  * its {@link Iterator#hasNext() hasNext} method is guaranteed to read-ahead by
 44  * at least one element. If {@code hasNext} method returns {@code true}, and is
 45  * followed by a call to the {@code next} method, it is guaranteed that the
 46  * {@code next} method will not throw an exception due to an I/O error, or
 47  * because the stream has been {@link #close closed}. The {@code Iterator} does
 48  * not support the {@link Iterator#remove remove} operation.
 49  *
 50  * &lt;p&gt; A {@code DirectoryStream} is opened upon creation and is closed by
 51  * invoking the {@code close} method. Closing a directory stream releases any
 52  * resources associated with the stream. Failure to close the stream may result
 53  * in a resource leak. The try-with-resources statement provides a useful
 54  * construct to ensure that the stream is closed:
 55  * &lt;pre&gt;
 56  *   Path dir = ...
 57  *   try (DirectoryStream&amp;lt;Path&amp;gt; stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir)) {
 58  *       for (Path entry: stream) {
 59  *           ...
 60  *       }
 61  *   }
 62  * &lt;/pre&gt;
 63  *
 64  * &lt;p&gt; Once a directory stream is closed, then further access to the directory,
 65  * using the {@code Iterator}, behaves as if the end of stream has been reached.
 66  * Due to read-ahead, the {@code Iterator} may return one or more elements
 67  * after the directory stream has been closed. Once these buffered elements
 68  * have been read, then subsequent calls to the {@code hasNext} method returns
 69  * {@code false}, and subsequent calls to the {@code next} method will throw
 70  * {@code NoSuchElementException}.
 71  *
 72  * &lt;p&gt; A directory stream is not required to be &lt;i&gt;asynchronously closeable&lt;/i&gt;.
 73  * If a thread is blocked on the directory stream&#39;s iterator reading from the
 74  * directory, and another thread invokes the {@code close} method, then the
 75  * second thread may block until the read operation is complete.
 76  *
 77  * &lt;p&gt; If an I/O error is encountered when accessing the directory then it
 78  * causes the {@code Iterator}&#39;s {@code hasNext} or {@code next} methods to
 79  * throw {@link DirectoryIteratorException} with the {@link IOException} as the
 80  * cause. As stated above, the {@code hasNext} method is guaranteed to
 81  * read-ahead by at least one element. This means that if {@code hasNext} method
 82  * returns {@code true}, and is followed by a call to the {@code next} method,
 83  * then it is guaranteed that the {@code next} method will not fail with a
 84  * {@code DirectoryIteratorException}.
 85  *
 86  * &lt;p&gt; The elements returned by the iterator are in no specific order. Some file
 87  * systems maintain special links to the directory itself and the directory&#39;s
 88  * parent directory. Entries representing these links are not returned by the
 89  * iterator.
 90  *
 91  * &lt;p&gt; The iterator is &lt;i&gt;weakly consistent&lt;/i&gt;. It is thread safe but does not
 92  * freeze the directory while iterating, so it may (or may not) reflect updates
 93  * to the directory that occur after the {@code DirectoryStream} is created.
 94  *
 95  * &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Usage Examples:&lt;/b&gt;
 96  * Suppose we want a list of the source files in a directory. This example uses
 97  * both the for-each and try-with-resources constructs.
 98  * &lt;pre&gt;
 99  *   List&amp;lt;Path&amp;gt; listSourceFiles(Path dir) throws IOException {
100  *       List&amp;lt;Path&amp;gt; result = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();
101  *       try (DirectoryStream&amp;lt;Path&amp;gt; stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir, &quot;*.{c,h,cpp,hpp,java}&quot;)) {
102  *           for (Path entry: stream) {
103  *               result.add(entry);
104  *           }
105  *       } catch (DirectoryIteratorException ex) {
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">106  *           // I/O error encounted during the iteration, the cause is an IOException</span>
107  *           throw ex.getCause();
108  *       }
109  *       return result;
110  *   }
111  * &lt;/pre&gt;

113  *
114  * @since 1.7
