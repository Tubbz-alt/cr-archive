 32  * A token representing the registration of a {@link SelectableChannel} with a
 33  * {@link Selector}.
 34  *
 35  * &lt;p&gt; A selection key is created each time a channel is registered with a
 36  * selector.  A key remains valid until it is &lt;i&gt;cancelled&lt;/i&gt; by invoking its
 37  * {@link #cancel cancel} method, by closing its channel, or by closing its
 38  * selector.  Cancelling a key does not immediately remove it from its
 39  * selector; it is instead added to the selector&#39;s &lt;a
 40  * href=&quot;Selector.html#ks&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;cancelled-key set&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for removal during the
 41  * next selection operation.  The validity of a key may be tested by invoking
 42  * its {@link #isValid isValid} method.
 43  *
 44  * &lt;a id=&quot;opsets&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 45  *
 46  * &lt;p&gt; A selection key contains two &lt;i&gt;operation sets&lt;/i&gt; represented as
 47  * integer values.  Each bit of an operation set denotes a category of
 48  * selectable operations that are supported by the key&#39;s channel.
 49  *
 50  * &lt;ul&gt;
 51  *
 52  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The &lt;i&gt;interest set&lt;/i&gt; determines which operation categories will
 53  *   be tested for readiness the next time one of the selector&#39;s selection
 54  *   methods is invoked.  The interest set is initialized with the value given
 55  *   when the key is created; it may later be changed via the {@link
 56  *   #interestOps(int)} method. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 57  *
 58  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The &lt;i&gt;ready set&lt;/i&gt; identifies the operation categories for which
 59  *   the key&#39;s channel has been detected to be ready by the key&#39;s selector.
 60  *   The ready set is initialized to zero when the key is created; it may later
 61  *   be updated by the selector during a selection operation, but it cannot be
 62  *   updated directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 63  *
 64  * &lt;/ul&gt;
 65  *
 66  * &lt;p&gt; That a selection key&#39;s ready set indicates that its channel is ready for
 67  * some operation category is a hint, but not a guarantee, that an operation in
 68  * such a category may be performed by a thread without causing the thread to
 69  * block.  A ready set is most likely to be accurate immediately after the
 70  * completion of a selection operation.  It is likely to be made inaccurate by
 71  * external events and by I/O operations that are invoked upon the
 72  * corresponding channel.
 73  *
 74  * &lt;p&gt; This class defines all known operation-set bits, but precisely which
 75  * bits are supported by a given channel depends upon the type of the channel.
 76  * Each subclass of {@link SelectableChannel} defines a {@link
 77  * SelectableChannel#validOps() validOps()} method which returns a set
 78  * identifying just those operations that are supported by the channel.  An
 79  * attempt to set or test an operation-set bit that is not supported by a key&#39;s
 80  * channel will result in an appropriate run-time exception.
 81  *
 82  * &lt;p&gt; It is often necessary to associate some application-specific data with a
 83  * selection key, for example an object that represents the state of a
 84  * higher-level protocol and handles readiness notifications in order to
 85  * implement that protocol.  Selection keys therefore support the
 86  * &lt;i&gt;attachment&lt;/i&gt; of a single arbitrary object to a key.  An object can be
 87  * attached via the {@link #attach attach} method and then later retrieved via
 88  * the {@link #attachment() attachment} method.
 89  *
 90  * &lt;p&gt; Selection keys are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  A
 91  * selection operation will always use the interest-set value that was current
 92  * at the moment that the operation began.  &lt;/p&gt;
