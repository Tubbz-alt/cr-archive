129      * Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.
130      * &lt;p&gt;
131      * All fields can be expressed as a {@code long} integer.
132      * This method returns an object that describes the valid range for that value.
133      * The value of this temporal object is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
134      * If the date-time cannot return the range, because the field is unsupported or for
135      * some other reason, an exception will be thrown.
136      * &lt;p&gt;
137      * Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values
138      * and it is important not to read too much into them. For example, there
139      * could be values within the range that are invalid for the field.
140      *
141      * @implSpec
142      * Implementations must check and handle all fields defined in {@link ChronoField}.
143      * If the field is supported, then the range of the field must be returned.
144      * If unsupported, then an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException} must be thrown.
145      * &lt;p&gt;
146      * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
<span class="line-modified">147      * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessorl)}</span>
148      * passing {@code this} as the argument.
149      * &lt;p&gt;
150      * Implementations must ensure that no observable state is altered when this
151      * read-only method is invoked.
152      * &lt;p&gt;
153      * The default implementation must behave equivalent to this code:
154      * &lt;pre&gt;
155      *  if (field instanceof ChronoField) {
156      *    if (isSupported(field)) {
157      *      return field.range();
158      *    }
159      *    throw new UnsupportedTemporalTypeException(&quot;Unsupported field: &quot; + field);
160      *  }
161      *  return field.rangeRefinedBy(this);
162      * &lt;/pre&gt;
163      *
164      * @param field  the field to query the range for, not null
165      * @return the range of valid values for the field, not null
166      * @throws DateTimeException if the range for the field cannot be obtained
167      * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the field is not supported
