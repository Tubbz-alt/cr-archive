 /**
  * A file attribute view that provides a view of a <em>basic set</em> of file
  * attributes common to many file systems. The basic set of file attributes
  * consist of <em>mandatory</em> and <em>optional</em> file attributes as
  * defined by the {@link BasicFileAttributes} interface.
-
+ *
  * <p> The file attributes are retrieved from the file system as a <em>bulk
  * operation</em> by invoking the {@link #readAttributes() readAttributes} method.
  * This class also defines the {@link #setTimes setTimes} method to update the
  * file's time attributes.
