 68  * Framework-level interface defining read-only access to a temporal object,
 69  * such as a date, time, offset or some combination of these.
 70  * &lt;p&gt;
 71  * This is the base interface type for date, time and offset objects.
 72  * It is implemented by those classes that can provide information
 73  * as {@linkplain TemporalField fields} or {@linkplain TemporalQuery queries}.
 74  * &lt;p&gt;
 75  * Most date and time information can be represented as a number.
 76  * These are modeled using {@code TemporalField} with the number held using
 77  * a {@code long} to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month are
 78  * simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.
 79  * See {@link ChronoField} for the standard set of fields.
 80  * &lt;p&gt;
 81  * Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,
 82  * the {@linkplain java.time.chrono.Chronology chronology} and the
 83  * {@linkplain java.time.ZoneId time-zone}.
 84  * These can be accessed via {@linkplain #query(TemporalQuery) queries} using
 85  * the static methods defined on {@link TemporalQuery}.
 86  * &lt;p&gt;
 87  * A sub-interface, {@link Temporal}, extends this definition to one that also
 88  * supports adjustment and manipulation on more complete temporal objects.
 89  * &lt;p&gt;
 90  * This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely
 91  * used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass
 92  * around instances of concrete types, such as {@code LocalDate}.
 93  * There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations
 94  * of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.
 95  * See {@link java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate} for a fuller discussion of the issues.
 96  *
 97  * @implSpec
 98  * This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,
 99  * however immutability is strongly recommended.
