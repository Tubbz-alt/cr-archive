 32  * Runtime object for low-level implementation of &lt;em&gt;pattern matching&lt;/em&gt;. A
 33  * {@linkplain PatternHandle} exposes functionality for determining if a target
 34  * matches the pattern, and if so, for conditionally extracting the resulting
 35  * bindings.
 36  *
 37  * &lt;p&gt;A {@linkplain PatternHandle} is parameterized by a &lt;em&gt;target type&lt;/em&gt;
 38  * and zero or more &lt;em&gt;binding variable types&lt;/em&gt;. The target type (denoted
 39  * {@code T}) is the type against which the pattern can be applied (often a
 40  * broad type such as {@link Object}, but need not be), and the binding variable
 41  * types (denoted {@code B*}) are the types of the binding variables that are
 42  * produced by a successful match.  These types are combined into a type
 43  * &lt;em&gt;descriptor&lt;/em&gt;, accessed via {@link #descriptor()}, where the return
 44  * type of the descriptor is the target type, and the parameter types of the
 45  * descriptor are the binding variable types.
 46  *
 47  * &lt;p&gt;The behavior of a {@linkplain PatternHandle} is exposed via method
 48  * handles.  The method handle returned by {@link #tryMatch()} is applied to the
 49  * target to be tested, and returns an opaque result of type {@code Object}.  If
 50  * the result is {@code null}, the match has failed; if is non-null, it has
 51  * succeeded, and the result can be used as input to the method handles returned
 52  * by {@link #components()} or {@link #component(int)} to retrieve specific
 53  * binding variables.
 54  *
 55  * &lt;p&gt;The class {@link PatternHandles} contains numerous factories and
 56  * combinators for {@linkplain PatternHandle}s, including {@link
 57  * PatternHandles#adaptTarget(PatternHandle, Class)} which can be used to adapt
 58  * a pattern handle from one target type to another (such as widening the set of
 59  * types against which it can be applied.)
 60  *
 61  * &lt;p&gt;{@linkplain PatternHandle} implementations must be &lt;a
 62  * href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;
 63  * classes.
