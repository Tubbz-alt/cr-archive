31  * DESCRIPTION
32  *     The test checks that
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">33  *         ThreadMBean.resetPeakThreadCount()</span>
34  *     returns correct result.
35  *     The test starts a couple of user threads and waits until they finish. After
36  *     that, resetPeakThreadCount() is invoked to reset the peak. Then
37  *     getPeakThreadCount() and getThreadCount() must return the same values. The
38  *     preposition is that no threads are appered/disappeared between
39  *     &quot;getPeakThreadCount()&quot; and getThreadCount()&quot; calls.
40  *     The test implements direct access to the metrics.
