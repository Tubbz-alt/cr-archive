32  * DESCRIPTION
33  *     The test starts 50 recursive threads, switches them  to the various
34  *     state after reaching 200 depth and checks up their stack traces
35  *     and states gotten via the ThreadMXBean interface.
36  *     Executable class of the test is the same as for the strace010 test.
37  *     In contrast to the strace010 test, the strace011 test is performed for
38  *     that:
39  *     Access to the management metrics is accomplished by calling via
40  *     default MBeanServer the methods in the MBean.
41  * COMMENTS
42  *     Reduced recursion depth value up to 100 because the test fails
43  *     due to timeout in -Xint mode on solaris-sparc(Sun Ultra-10, 333 MHz, 256Mb)
