31  * DESCRIPTION
32  *     The test checks that
33  *         ThreadMBean.isThreadCpuTimeSupported()
34  *     method returns true. The test performs access to management metrics
35  *     through default MBeanServer proxy.
36  *     Note, that the test is correct ONLY against Sun&#39;s Hotspot VM. This
37  *     feature is optional and the method may return either true, or false.
38  *     However, Sun&#39;s implementation must always return true.
