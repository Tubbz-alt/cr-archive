31  * DESCRIPTION
32  *     The test checks that
33  *         ThreadMBean.isCurrentThreadCpuTimeSupported()
34  *     method returns true. The test performs access to management metrics
35  *     through custom MBeanServer proxy (developed and saved in
36  *     $TESTBASE/src/nsk/monitoring/share).
37  *     Note, that the test is correct ONLY against Sun&#39;s Hotspot VM. This
38  *     feature is optional and the method may return either true, or false.
39  *     However, Sun&#39;s implementation must always return true.
