  *     The test checks that

+ *         ThreadMXBean.resetPeakThreadCount()
  *     returns correct result.
  *     The test starts a couple of user threads and waits until they finish. After
  *     that, resetPeakThreadCount() is invoked to reset the peak. Then
  *     getPeakThreadCount() and getThreadCount() must return the same values. The
