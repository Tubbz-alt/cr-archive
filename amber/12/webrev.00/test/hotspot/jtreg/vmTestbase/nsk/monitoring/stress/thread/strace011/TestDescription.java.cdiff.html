   * DESCRIPTION
   *     The test starts 50 recursive threads, switches them  to the various
   *     state after reaching 200 depth and checks up their stack traces
<span class="line-modified">!  *     and states gotten via the ThreadMBean interface.</span>
   *     Executable class of the test is the same as for the strace010 test.
   *     In contrast to the strace010 test, the strace011 test is performed for
