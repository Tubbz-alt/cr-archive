32  * DESCRIPTION
33  *     The test starts 50 recursive threads, switches them  to the various
34  *     state after reaching 200 depth and checks up their stack traces
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">35  *     and states gotten via the ThreadMBean interface.</span>
36  *     Executable class of the test is the same as for the strace010 test.
37  *     In contrast to the strace010 test, the strace013 test is performed for
38  *     the case when recursive method is native.
39  *     Access to the management metrics is accomplished by DIRECTLY calling
40  *     the methods in the MBean.
41  * COMMENTS
42  *     Reduced recursion depth value up to 100 because the test fails
43  *     due to timeout in -Xint mode on solaris-sparc(Sun Ultra-10, 333 MHz, 256Mb)
