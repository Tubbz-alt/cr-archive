31  * DESCRIPTION
32  *     The test checks that Garbage Collector correctly uses stealing technique:
33  *     no unexpected exceptions and errors are thrown; the JVM is not crashed.
34  *     Actually, the test is intended for Parallel Collector.
35  *     The test starts just one thread, then creates a small NonbranyTree and a
36  *     huge one. Both trees are to fill about 80% of the memory. Then the test
37  *     drops references to both trees and invoke Algorithms.eatMemory(int) to
38  *     provoke GC to clean the memory. the GC should correctly remove both
39  *     objects. If the GC is Parallel, there are more than one GC threads, so one
40  *     will try to &quot;steal&quot; some job from others.
41  *
