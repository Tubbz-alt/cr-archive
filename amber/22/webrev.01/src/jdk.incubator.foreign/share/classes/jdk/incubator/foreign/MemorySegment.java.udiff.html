   * considered:
   * &lt;ul&gt;

   *     as &lt;em&gt;not alive&lt;/em&gt; (see {@link MemorySegment#isAlive()}). Also, since the buffer and heap segments might keep
   *     strong references to the original buffer or array instance, it is the responsibility of clients to ensure that

<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * set of operations that are supported by that segment. For instance, attempting to call {@link #close()} on</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * a segment which does not support the {@link #CLOSE} access mode will result in an exception.</span>

<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * The set of supported access modes can only be made stricter (by supporting &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; access modes). This means</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * that restricting the set of access modes supported by a segment before sharing it with other clients</span>

<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ MemorySegment segment = ...</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ MemorySegment roSegment = segment.withAccessModes(segment.accessModes() &amp; ~WRITE);</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * It is also possible to create views whose spatial bounds are stricter than the ones of the original segment</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * (see {@link MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long)}).</span>
   * &lt;p&gt;
   * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
   * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
   * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as calling</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * {@link MemorySegment#acquire()} before sharing the view with another client.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as removing {@link #CLOSE}</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * from the set of supported access modes, before sharing the view with another client.</span>
   * &lt;p&gt;
   * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
   * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
   * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
