   * A memory segment models a contiguous region of memory. A memory segment is associated with both spatial
   * and temporal bounds. Spatial bounds ensure that memory access operations on a memory segment cannot affect a memory location
   * which falls &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment being accessed. Temporal checks ensure that memory access

   * Finally, it is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by a memory-mapped file using the factory method

   * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed

   * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
   * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
   * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">!  * If a memory segment S owned by thread A needs to be used by thread B, B needs to explicitly &lt;em&gt;acquire&lt;/em&gt; S,</span>

<span class="line-modified">!  * as S. A memory segment can be acquired multiple times by one or more threads; in that case, a memory segment S cannot</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * be closed until all the acquired memory segments derived from S have been closed. Furthermore, closing an acquired</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * memory segment does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trigger any deallocation action. It is therefore important that clients remember to</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * explicitly close the original segment from which the acquired memory segments have been obtained in order to truly</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * ensure that off-heap resources associated with the memory segment are released.</span>
   *
   * &lt;h2&gt;Memory segment views&lt;/h2&gt;
   *
<span class="line-modified">!  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;. It is possible to create an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; view of a memory segment</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * (see {@link MemorySegment#asReadOnly()}) which does not support write operations. It is also possible to create views</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * whose spatial bounds are stricter than the ones of the original segment (see {@link MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long)}).</span>
   * &lt;p&gt;
   * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
   * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
   * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
<span class="line-modified">!  * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as calling</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * {@link MemorySegment#acquire()} before sharing the view with another client.</span>
   * &lt;p&gt;
   * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
   * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
   * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
<span class="line-modified">!  * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory address from which they originated.</span>
   *

<span class="line-added">+  *</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * Memory segments supports zero or more &lt;em&gt;access modes&lt;/em&gt;. Supported access modes are {@link #READ},</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * {@link #WRITE}, {@link #CLOSE}, {@link #ACQUIRE} and {@link #HANDOFF}. The set of access modes supported by a segment alters the</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * set of operations that are supported by that segment. For instance, attempting to call {@link #close()} on</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * a segment which does not support the {@link #CLOSE} access mode will result in an exception.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * &lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * The set of supported access modes can only be made stricter (by supporting &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; access modes). This means</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * that restricting the set of access modes supported by a segment before sharing it with other clients</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * is generally a good practice if the creator of the segment wants to retain some control over how the segment</span>
