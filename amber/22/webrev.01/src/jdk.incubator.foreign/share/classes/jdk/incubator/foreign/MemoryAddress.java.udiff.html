<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * as &lt;em&gt;offsets&lt;/em&gt; into some underlying memory segment (see {@link #segment()} and {@link #segmentOffset()}).</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * Since checked memory addresses feature both spatial and temporal bounds, these addresses can &lt;em&gt;safely&lt;/em&gt; be</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * dereferenced using a memory access var handle (see {@link MemoryHandles}).</span>
   * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * A memory address is typically used as the first argument in a memory access var handle call, to perform some operation</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * on the underlying memory backing a given memory segment. Since a memory address is always associated with a memory segment,</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * such access operations are always subject to spatial and temporal checks as enforced by the address&#39; owning memory region.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * If an address does not have any associated segment, it is said to be &lt;em&gt;unchecked&lt;/em&gt;. Unchecked memory</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * addresses do not feature known spatial or temporal bounds; as such, attempting a memory dereference operation</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * using an unchecked memory address will result in a runtime exception. Unchecked addresses can be obtained</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * e.g. by calling the {@link #ofLong(long)} method.</span>
   * &lt;p&gt;
   * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
   * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
   * instances of {@code MemoryAddress} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
   * be used for comparisons.
