 55 
 56    &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
 57    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
 58    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

 60 
 61    &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
 62    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 63    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 64    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 65 
 66    &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 67    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 68    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 69    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 70    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 71    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 72    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 73 
 74    &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
 75    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
 76    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 77    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
 78    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
 79    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;

 81    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
 82    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

 87 
 88    &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 89    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 90    subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 91 
 92 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 93    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 94    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 95    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 96    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 97    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 98 
 99 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
100    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
101    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
102    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
103    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
104    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
105    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
106    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
107    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
108    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
109    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
110    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
111    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
112    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
113    as of the date such litigation is filed.
114 
115 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
116    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
117    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
118    meet the following conditions:
119 
120    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
121        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
122 
123    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
124        stating that You changed the files; and
125 
126    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
127        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
128        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
129        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
130        the Derivative Works; and
131 
132    (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
133        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
134        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
135        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
136        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
137        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
138        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
139        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
140        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
141        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
142        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
143        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
144        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
145        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
146        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
147        as modifying the License.
148 
149    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
150    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
151    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
152    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
153    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
154    the conditions stated in this License.
155 
156 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
157    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
158    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
159    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
160    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
161    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
162    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
163 
164 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
165    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
166    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
167    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
168 
169 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
170    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
171    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
172    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
173    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
174    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
175    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
176    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
177    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
178 
179 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
180    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
181    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
182    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
183    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
184    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
185    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
186    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
187    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
188    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
189    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
190 
191 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
192    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
193    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
194    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
195    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
196    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
197    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
198    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
199    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
200    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
