33  * &lt;em&gt;Skeletons and statically generated stubs are deprecated.  This
34  * includes the APIs in this package that require the use of skeletons

36  * and static stubs may be removed in a future release of the
37  * platform. Skeletons are unnecessary, as server-side method dispatching
38  * is handled directly by the RMI runtime. Statically generated stubs are
39  * unnecessary, as stubs are generated dynamically using {@link
40  * java.lang.reflect.Proxy Proxy} objects. See {@link
