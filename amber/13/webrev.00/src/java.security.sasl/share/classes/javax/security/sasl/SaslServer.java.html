 29  * Performs SASL authentication as a server.
 30  * &lt;p&gt;
 31  * A server such an LDAP server gets an instance of this
 32  * class in order to perform authentication defined by a specific SASL
 33  * mechanism. Invoking methods on the {@code SaslServer} instance
 34  * generates challenges according to the SASL
 35  * mechanism implemented by the {@code SaslServer}.
 36  * As the authentication proceeds, the instance
 37  * encapsulates the state of a SASL server&#39;s authentication exchange.
 38  * &lt;p&gt;
 39  * Here&#39;s an example of how an LDAP server might use a {@code SaslServer}.
 40  * It first gets an instance of a {@code SaslServer} for the SASL mechanism
 41  * requested by the client:
 42  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 43  * SaslServer ss = Sasl.createSaslServer(mechanism,
 44  *     &quot;ldap&quot;, myFQDN, props, callbackHandler);
 45  * &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 46  * It can then proceed to use the server for authentication.
 47  * For example, suppose the LDAP server received an LDAP BIND request
 48  * containing the name of the SASL mechanism and an (optional) initial
 49  * response. It then might use the server as follows:
 50  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
 51  * while (!ss.isComplete()) {
 52  *     try {
 53  *         byte[] challenge = ss.evaluateResponse(response);
 54  *         if (ss.isComplete()) {
 55  *             status = ldap.sendBindResponse(mechanism, challenge, SUCCESS);
 56  *         } else {
 57  *             status = ldap.sendBindResponse(mechanism, challenge,
 58  *                 SASL_BIND_IN_PROGRESS);
 59  *             response = ldap.readBindRequest();
 60  *         }
 61  *     } catch (SaslException e) {
 62  *         status = ldap.sendErrorResponse(e);
 63  *         break;
 64  *     }
 65  * }
 66  * if (ss.isComplete() &amp;&amp; status == SUCCESS) {
 67  *     String qop = (String) sc.getNegotiatedProperty(Sasl.QOP);
 68  *     if (qop != null
 69  *         &amp;&amp; (qop.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;auth-int&quot;)
 70  *             || qop.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;auth-conf&quot;))) {
 71  *
 72  *         // Use SaslServer.wrap() and SaslServer.unwrap() for future
 73  *         // communication with client
 74  *         ldap.in = new SecureInputStream(ss, ldap.in);
 75  *         ldap.out = new SecureOutputStream(ss, ldap.out);
 76  *     }
 77  * }
 78  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
