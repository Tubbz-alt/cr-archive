 29  * Performs SASL authentication as a client.
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified"> 30  *&lt;p&gt;</span>
 31  * A protocol library such as one for LDAP gets an instance of this
 32  * class in order to perform authentication defined by a specific SASL
 33  * mechanism. Invoking methods on the {@code SaslClient} instance
 34  * process challenges and create responses according to the SASL
 35  * mechanism implemented by the {@code SaslClient}.
 36  * As the authentication proceeds, the instance
 37  * encapsulates the state of a SASL client&#39;s authentication exchange.
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a><span class="line-modified"> 38  *&lt;p&gt;</span>
 39  * Here&#39;s an example of how an LDAP library might use a {@code SaslClient}.
 40  * It first gets an instance of a {@code SaslClient}:
<a name="4" id="anc4"></a><span class="line-modified"> 41  *&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code</span>
 42  * SaslClient sc = Sasl.createSaslClient(mechanisms,
 43  *     authorizationId, protocol, serverName, props, callbackHandler);
<a name="5" id="anc5"></a><span class="line-modified"> 44  *}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</span>
 45  * It can then proceed to use the client for authentication.
 46  * For example, an LDAP library might use the client as follows:
<a name="6" id="anc6"></a><span class="line-modified"> 47  *&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code</span>
 48  * // Get initial response and send to server
 49  * byte[] response = (sc.hasInitialResponse() ? sc.evaluateChallenge(new byte[0]) :
 50  *     null);
 51  * LdapResult res = ldap.sendBindRequest(dn, sc.getName(), response);
 52  * while (!sc.isComplete() &amp;&amp;
 53  *     (res.status == SASL_BIND_IN_PROGRESS || res.status == SUCCESS)) {
 54  *     response = sc.evaluateChallenge(res.getBytes());
 55  *     if (res.status == SUCCESS) {
 56  *         // we&#39;re done; don&#39;t expect to send another BIND
 57  *         if (response != null) {
 58  *             throw new SaslException(
 59  *                 &quot;Protocol error: attempting to send response after completion&quot;);
 60  *         }
 61  *         break;
 62  *     }
 63  *     res = ldap.sendBindRequest(dn, sc.getName(), response);
 64  * }
 65  * if (sc.isComplete() &amp;&amp; res.status == SUCCESS) {
 66  *    String qop = (String) sc.getNegotiatedProperty(Sasl.QOP);
 67  *    if (qop != null
 68  *        &amp;&amp; (qop.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;auth-int&quot;)
 69  *            || qop.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;auth-conf&quot;))) {
 70  *
 71  *      // Use SaslClient.wrap() and SaslClient.unwrap() for future
 72  *      // communication with server
 73  *      ldap.in = new SecureInputStream(sc, ldap.in);
 74  *      ldap.out = new SecureOutputStream(sc, ldap.out);
 75  *    }
 76  * }
<a name="7" id="anc7"></a><span class="line-modified"> 77  *}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</span>
 78  *
 79  * If the mechanism has an initial response, the library invokes
 80  * {@code evaluateChallenge()} with an empty
 81  * challenge and to get initial response.
 82  * Protocols such as IMAP4, which do not include an initial response with
 83  * their first authentication command to the server, initiates the
 84  * authentication without first calling {@code hasInitialResponse()}
 85  * or {@code evaluateChallenge()}.
 86  * When the server responds to the command, it sends an initial challenge.
 87  * For a SASL mechanism in which the client sends data first, the server should
 88  * have issued a challenge with no data. This will then result in a call
 89  * (on the client) to {@code evaluateChallenge()} with an empty challenge.
