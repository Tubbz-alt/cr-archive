- * added to future versions of the Java&trade; programming language.

- * classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
- * methods with names beginning with {@code "visit"}.

- * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new element scanner visitor
- * class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language
