 65  *
 66  * &lt;p&gt;The case of names is significant.  All names should be treated
 67  * as case-sensitive.  For example, some file systems have
 68  * case-insensitive, case-aware file names.  File objects representing
 69  * such files should take care to preserve case by using {@link
 70  * java.io.File#getCanonicalFile} or similar means.  If the system is
 71  * not case-aware, file objects must use other means to preserve case.
 72  *
 73  * &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;relative_name&quot;&gt;Relative names&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; some
 74  * methods in this interface use relative names.  A relative name is a
 75  * non-null, non-empty sequence of path segments separated by &#39;/&#39;.
 76  * &#39;.&#39; or &#39;..&#39;  are invalid path segments.  A valid relative name must
 77  * match the &quot;path-rootless&quot; rule of &lt;a
 78  * href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt&quot;&gt;RFC&amp;nbsp;3986&lt;/a&gt;,
 79  * section&amp;nbsp;3.3.  Informally, this should be true:
 80  *
 81  * &lt;!-- URI.create(relativeName).normalize().getPath().equals(relativeName) --&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 82  * &lt;pre&gt;  URI.{@linkplain java.net.URI#create create}(relativeName).{@linkplain java.net.URI#normalize normalize}().{@linkplain java.net.URI#getPath getPath}().equals(relativeName)&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
 83  *
 84  * &lt;p&gt;All methods in this interface might throw a SecurityException.
 85  *
 86  * &lt;p&gt;An object of this interface is not required to support
 87  * multi-threaded access, that is, be synchronized.  However, it must
 88  * support concurrent access to different file objects created by this
 89  * object.
 90  *
 91  * &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementation note:&lt;/em&gt; a consequence of this requirement
 92  * is that a trivial implementation of output to a {@linkplain
 93  * java.util.jar.JarOutputStream} is not a sufficient implementation.
 94  * That is, rather than creating a JavaFileObject that returns the
 95  * JarOutputStream directly, the contents must be cached until closed
 96  * and then written to the JarOutputStream.
 97  *
 98  * &lt;p&gt;Unless explicitly allowed, all methods in this interface might
 99  * throw a NullPointerException if given a {@code null} argument.
