 41  * Textual representation of IPv4 address used as input to methods
 42  * takes one of the following forms:
 43  *
 44  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type:none&quot;&gt;
 45  * &lt;li&gt;{@code d.d.d.d}&lt;/li&gt;

 48  * &lt;li&gt;{@code d}&lt;/li&gt;
 49  * &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 50  *
 51  * &lt;p&gt; When four parts are specified, each is interpreted as a byte of
 52  * data and assigned, from left to right, to the four bytes of an IPv4
 53  * address.
<span class="line-modified"> 54 </span>
 55  * &lt;p&gt; When a three part address is specified, the last part is
 56  * interpreted as a 16-bit quantity and placed in the right most two
 57  * bytes of the network address. This makes the three part address
 58  * format convenient for specifying Class B net- work addresses as
 59  * 128.net.host.
 60  *
 61  * &lt;p&gt; When a two part address is supplied, the last part is
 62  * interpreted as a 24-bit quantity and placed in the right most three
 63  * bytes of the network address. This makes the two part address
 64  * format convenient for specifying Class A network addresses as
 65  * net.host.
 66  *
 67  * &lt;p&gt; When only one part is given, the value is stored directly in
 68  * the network address without any byte rearrangement.
 69  *
 70  * &lt;p&gt; For methods that return a textual representation as output
 71  * value, the first form, i.e. a dotted-quad string, is used.
