 27  * Classes to support module descriptors and creating configurations of modules
 28  * by means of resolution and service binding.
 29  *
 30  * &lt;p&gt; Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 31  * or method of any class or interface in this package will cause a {@link
 32  * java.lang.NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown. Additionally,
 33  * invoking a method with an array or collection containing a {@code null} element
 34  * will cause a {@code NullPointerException}, unless otherwise specified. &lt;/p&gt;
 35  *
 36  *
 37  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;resolution&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;{@index &quot;Module Resolution&quot;}&lt;/h2&gt;
 38  *
 39  * &lt;p&gt; Resolution is the process of computing how modules depend on each other.
 40  * The process occurs at compile time and run time. &lt;/p&gt;
 41  *
 42  * &lt;p&gt; Resolution is a two-step process. The first step recursively enumerates
 43  * the &#39;requires&#39; directives of a set of root modules. If all the enumerated
 44  * modules are observable, then the second step computes their readability graph.
 45  * The readability graph embodies how modules depend on each other, which in
 46  * turn controls access across module boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;
 47  *
 48  * &lt;h3&gt; Step 1: Recursive enumeration &lt;/h3&gt;
 49  *
 50  * &lt;p&gt; Recursive enumeration takes a set of module names, looks up each of their
 51  * module declarations, and for each module declaration, recursively enumerates:
 52  *
 53  * &lt;ul&gt;
 54  *   &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; the module names given by the &#39;requires&#39; directives with the
 55  *   &#39;transitive&#39; modifier, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 56  *   &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; at the discretion of the host system, the module names given by
 57  *   the &#39;requires&#39; directives without the &#39;transitive&#39; modifier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 58  * &lt;/ul&gt;
 59  *
 60  * &lt;p&gt; Module declarations are looked up in a set of observable modules. The set
 61  * of observable modules is determined in an implementation specific manner. The
 62  * set of observable modules may include modules with explicit declarations
 63  * (that is, with a {@code module-info.java} source file or {@code module-info.class}
 64  * file) and modules with implicit declarations (that is,
 65  * &lt;a href=&quot;ModuleFinder.html#automatic-modules&quot;&gt;automatic modules&lt;/a&gt;).
 66  * Because an automatic module has no explicit module declaration, it has no
 67  * &#39;requires&#39; directives of its own, although its name may be given by a
 68  * &#39;requires&#39; directive of an explicit module declaration. &lt;/p&gt;
 69 
 70  * &lt;p&gt; The set of root modules, whose names are the initial input to this
 71  * algorithm, is determined in an implementation specific manner. The set of
 72  * root modules may include automatic modules. &lt;/p&gt;
 73  *
 74  * &lt;p&gt; If at least one automatic module is enumerated by this algorithm, then
 75  * every observable automatic module must be enumerated, regardless of whether
 76  * any of their names are given by &#39;requires&#39; directives of explicit module
 77  * declarations. &lt;/p&gt;
 78  *
 79  * &lt;p&gt; If any of the following conditions occur, then resolution fails:
 80  * &lt;ul&gt;
 81  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any root module is not observable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 82  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any module whose name is given by a &#39;requires&#39; directive with the
 83  *   &#39;transitive&#39; modifier is not observable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 84  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the discretion of the host system, any module whose name is given
 85  *   by a &#39;requires&#39; directive without the &#39;transitive&#39; modifier is not
 86  *   observable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 87  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The algorithm in this step enumerates the same module name twice. This
 88  *   indicates a cycle in the &#39;requires&#39; directives, disregarding any &#39;transitive&#39;
 89  *   modifiers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 90  * &lt;/ul&gt;
 91  *
 92  * &lt;p&gt; Otherwise, resolution proceeds to step 2. &lt;/p&gt;
 93  *
 94  * &lt;h3&gt; Step 2: Computing the readability graph &lt;/h3&gt;
 95  *
 96  * &lt;p&gt; A &#39;requires&#39; directive (irrespective of &#39;transitive&#39;) expresses that
 97  * one module depends on some other module. The effect of the &#39;transitive&#39;
 98  * modifier is to cause additional modules to also depend on the other module.
 99  * If module M &#39;requires transitive N&#39;, then not only does M depend on N, but
100  * any module that depends on M also depends on N. This allows M to be
101  * refactored so that some or all of its content can be moved to a new module N
102  * without breaking modules that have a &#39;requires M&#39; directive. &lt;/p&gt;
103  *
104  * &lt;p&gt; Module dependencies are represented by the readability graph. The
105  * readability graph is a directed graph whose vertices are the modules
106  * enumerated in step 1 and whose edges represent readability between pairs of
107  * modules. The edges are specified as follows:
108  *
109  * &lt;p&gt; First, readability is determined by the &#39;requires&#39; directives of the
110  * enumerated modules, disregarding any &#39;transitive&#39; modifiers:
111  *
112  * &lt;ul&gt;
113  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; For each enumerated module A that &#39;requires&#39; B: A &quot;reads&quot; B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
114  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; For each enumerated module X that is automatic: X &quot;reads&quot; every
115  *   other enumerated module (it is &quot;as if&quot; an automatic module has &#39;requires&#39;
116  *   directives for every other enumerated module). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
117  * &lt;/ul&gt;
118  *
119  * &lt;p&gt; Second, readability is augmented to account for &#39;transitive&#39; modifiers:
120  * &lt;ul&gt;
121  *   &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; For each enumerated module A that &quot;reads&quot; B: &lt;/p&gt;
122  *     &lt;ul&gt;
123  *     &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; If B &#39;requires transitive&#39; C, then A &quot;reads&quot; C as well as B. This
124  *     augmentation is recursive: since A &quot;reads&quot; C, if C &#39;requires transitive&#39;
125  *     D, then A &quot;reads&quot; D as well as C and B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
126  *     &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; If B is an automatic module, then A &quot;reads&quot; every other enumerated
127  *     automatic module. (It is &quot;as if&quot; an automatic module has &#39;requires transitive&#39;
128  *     directives for every other enumerated automatic module).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
129  *     &lt;/ul&gt;
130  *   &lt;/li&gt;
131  * &lt;/ul&gt;
132  *
133  * &lt;p&gt; Finally, every module &quot;reads&quot; itself. &lt;/p&gt;
134  *
135  * &lt;p&gt; If any of the following conditions occur in the readability graph, then
136  * resolution fails:
137  * &lt;ul&gt;
138  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; A module &quot;reads&quot; two or more modules with the same name. This includes
139  *   the case where a module &quot;reads&quot; another with the same name as itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
140  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two or more modules export a package with the same name to a module
141  *   that &quot;reads&quot; both. This includes the case where a module M containing package
142  *   p &quot;reads&quot; another module that exports p to M. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
143  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; A module M declares that it &#39;uses p.S&#39; or &#39;provides p.S with ...&#39; but
144  *   package p is neither in module M nor exported to M by any module that M
145  *   &quot;reads&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
146  * &lt;/ul&gt;
147  * &lt;p&gt; Otherwise, resolution succeeds, and the result of resolution is the
148  * readability graph.
149  *
150  * &lt;h3&gt; Root modules &lt;/h3&gt;
151  *
152  * &lt;p&gt; The set of root modules at compile-time is usually the set of modules
153  * being compiled. At run-time, the set of root modules is usually the
154  * application module specified to the &#39;java&#39; launcher. When compiling code in
155  * the unnamed module, or at run-time when the main application class is loaded
156  * from the class path, then the default set of root modules is implementation
157  * specific. In the JDK the default set of root modules contains every module
158  * that is observable on the upgrade module path or among the system modules,
159  * and that exports at least one package without qualification. &lt;/p&gt;
160  *
161  * &lt;h3&gt; Observable modules &lt;/h3&gt;
162  *
163  * &lt;p&gt; The set of observable modules at both compile-time and run-time is
164  * determined by searching several different paths, and also by searching
165  * the compiled modules built in to the environment. The search order is as
166  * follows: &lt;/p&gt;
167  *
168  * &lt;ol&gt;
169  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; At compile time only, the compilation module path. This path
170  *   contains module definitions in source form.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
171  *
172  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The upgrade module path. This path contains compiled definitions of
173  *   modules that will be observed in preference to the compiled definitions of
174  *   any &lt;i&gt;upgradeable modules&lt;/i&gt; that are present in (3) and (4). See the Java
175  *   SE Platform for the designation of which standard modules are upgradeable.
176  *   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
177  *
178  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The system modules, which are the compiled definitions built in to
179  *   the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
180  *
181  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The application module path. This path contains compiled definitions
182  *   of library and application modules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
183  *
184  * &lt;/ol&gt;
185  *
186  * &lt;h3&gt; &#39;requires&#39; directives with &#39;static&#39; modifier &lt;/h3&gt;
187  *
188  * &lt;p&gt; &#39;requires&#39; directives that have the &#39;static&#39; modifier express an optional
189  * dependence at run time. If a module declares that it &#39;requires static M&#39; then
190  * resolution does not search the observable modules for M to satisfy the dependency.
191  * However, if M is recursively enumerated at step 1 then all modules that are
192  * enumerated and `requires static M` will read M. &lt;/p&gt;
193  *
194  * &lt;h3&gt; Completeness &lt;/h3&gt;
195  *
196  * &lt;p&gt; Resolution may be partial at compile-time in that the complete transitive
197  * closure may not be required to compile a set of modules. Minimally, the
198  * readability graph that is constructed and validated at compile-time includes
199  * the modules being compiled, their direct dependences, and all implicitly
200  * declared dependences (requires transitive). &lt;/p&gt;
201  *
202  * &lt;p&gt; At run-time, resolution is an additive process. The recursive enumeration
203  * at step 1 may be relative to previous resolutions so that a root module,
204  * or a module named in a &#39;requires&#39; directive, is not enumerated when it was
205  * enumerated by a previous (or parent) resolution. The readability graph that
206  * is the result of resolution may therefore have a vertex for a module enumerated
207  * in step 1 but with an edge to represent that the module reads a module that
208  * was enumerated by previous (or parent) resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
