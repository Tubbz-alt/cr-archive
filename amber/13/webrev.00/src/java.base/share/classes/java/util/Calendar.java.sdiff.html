 100  * &lt;h2&gt;Getting and Setting Calendar Field Values&lt;/h2&gt;
 101  *
 102  * &lt;p&gt;The calendar field values can be set by calling the {@code set}
 103  * methods. Any field values set in a {@code Calendar} will not be
 104  * interpreted until it needs to calculate its time value (milliseconds from
 105  * the Epoch) or values of the calendar fields. Calling the
 106  * {@code get}, {@code getTimeInMillis}, {@code getTime},
 107  * {@code add} and {@code roll} involves such calculation.
 108  *
 109  * &lt;h3&gt;Leniency&lt;/h3&gt;
 110  *
 111  * &lt;p&gt;{@code Calendar} has two modes for interpreting the calendar
 112  * fields, &lt;em&gt;lenient&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;non-lenient&lt;/em&gt;.  When a
 113  * {@code Calendar} is in lenient mode, it accepts a wider range of
 114  * calendar field values than it produces.  When a {@code Calendar}
 115  * recomputes calendar field values for return by {@code get()}, all of
 116  * the calendar fields are normalized. For example, a lenient
 117  * {@code GregorianCalendar} interprets {@code MONTH == JANUARY},
 118  * {@code DAY_OF_MONTH == 32} as February 1.
<span class="line-modified"> 119 </span>
 120  * &lt;p&gt;When a {@code Calendar} is in non-lenient mode, it throws an
 121  * exception if there is any inconsistency in its calendar fields. For
 122  * example, a {@code GregorianCalendar} always produces
 123  * {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} values between 1 and the length of the month. A
 124  * non-lenient {@code GregorianCalendar} throws an exception upon
 125  * calculating its time or calendar field values if any out-of-range field
 126  * value has been set.
 127  *
 128  * &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;first_week&quot;&gt;First Week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 129  *
 130  * {@code Calendar} defines a locale-specific seven day week using two
 131  * parameters: the first day of the week and the minimal days in first week
 132  * (from 1 to 7).  These numbers are taken from the locale resource data or the
 133  * locale itself when a {@code Calendar} is constructed. If the designated
 134  * locale contains &quot;fw&quot; and/or &quot;rg&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;./Locale.html#def_locale_extension&quot;&gt;
 135  * Unicode extensions&lt;/a&gt;, the first day of the week will be obtained according to
 136  * those extensions. If both &quot;fw&quot; and &quot;rg&quot; are specified, the value from the &quot;fw&quot;
 137  * extension supersedes the implicit one from the &quot;rg&quot; extension.
 138  * They may also be specified explicitly through the methods for setting their
 139  * values.
</pre>
<hr />
<pre>
 218  * &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;{@code set(f, value)}&lt;/strong&gt; changes calendar field
 219  * {@code f} to {@code value}.  In addition, it sets an
 220  * internal member variable to indicate that calendar field {@code f} has
 221  * been changed. Although calendar field {@code f} is changed immediately,
 222  * the calendar&#39;s time value in milliseconds is not recomputed until the next call to
 223  * {@code get()}, {@code getTime()}, {@code getTimeInMillis()},
 224  * {@code add()}, or {@code roll()} is made. Thus, multiple calls to
 225  * {@code set()} do not trigger multiple, unnecessary
 226  * computations. As a result of changing a calendar field using
 227  * {@code set()}, other calendar fields may also change, depending on the
 228  * calendar field, the calendar field value, and the calendar system. In addition,
 229  * {@code get(f)} will not necessarily return {@code value} set by
 230  * the call to the {@code set} method
 231  * after the calendar fields have been recomputed. The specifics are determined by
 232  * the concrete calendar class.&lt;/p&gt;
 233  *
 234  * &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example&lt;/em&gt;: Consider a {@code GregorianCalendar}
 235  * originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling &lt;code&gt;set(Calendar.MONTH,
 236  * Calendar.SEPTEMBER)&lt;/code&gt; sets the date to September 31,
 237  * 1999. This is a temporary internal representation that resolves to
<span class="line-modified"> 238  * October 1, 1999 if {@code getTime()}is then called. However, a</span>
 239  * call to {@code set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 30)} before the call to
 240  * {@code getTime()} sets the date to September 30, 1999, since
 241  * no recomputation occurs after {@code set()} itself.&lt;/p&gt;
 242  *
 243  * &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;{@code add(f, delta)}&lt;/strong&gt; adds {@code delta}
 244  * to field {@code f}.  This is equivalent to calling &lt;code&gt;set(f,
 245  * get(f) + delta)&lt;/code&gt; with two adjustments:&lt;/p&gt;
 246  *
 247  * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 248  *   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add rule 1&lt;/strong&gt;. The value of field {@code f}
 249  *   after the call minus the value of field {@code f} before the
 250  *   call is {@code delta}, modulo any overflow that has occurred in
 251  *   field {@code f}. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its
 252  *   range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or
 253  *   decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range.&lt;/p&gt;
 254  *
 255  *   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add rule 2&lt;/strong&gt;. If a smaller field is expected to be
 256  *   invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal to its
 257  *   prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after field
 258  *   {@code f} is changed or other constraints, such as time zone
