 46  * The {@code RuleBasedCollator} class is a concrete subclass of
 47  * {@code Collator} that provides a simple, data-driven, table
 48  * collator.  With this class you can create a customized table-based
 49  * {@code Collator}.  {@code RuleBasedCollator} maps
 50  * characters to sort keys.
 51  *
 52  * &lt;p&gt;
 53  * {@code RuleBasedCollator} has the following restrictions
 54  * for efficiency (other subclasses may be used for more complex languages) :
 55  * &lt;ol&gt;
 56  * &lt;li&gt;If a special collation rule controlled by a &amp;lt;modifier&amp;gt; is
<span class="line-modified"> 57       specified it applies to the whole collator object.</span>
 58  * &lt;li&gt;All non-mentioned characters are at the end of the
 59  *     collation order.
 60  * &lt;/ol&gt;
 61  *
 62  * &lt;p&gt;
 63  * The collation table is composed of a list of collation rules, where each
 64  * rule is of one of three forms:
 65  * &lt;pre&gt;
 66  *    &amp;lt;modifier&amp;gt;
 67  *    &amp;lt;relation&amp;gt; &amp;lt;text-argument&amp;gt;

 70  * The definitions of the rule elements is as follows:
 71  * &lt;UL&gt;
 72  *    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text-Argument&lt;/strong&gt;: A text-argument is any sequence of
 73  *        characters, excluding special characters (that is, common
 74  *        whitespace characters [0009-000D, 0020] and rule syntax characters
 75  *        [0021-002F, 003A-0040, 005B-0060, 007B-007E]). If those
 76  *        characters are desired, you can put them in single quotes
