29  * Indicates the contexts in which an annotation type is applicable. The
30  * declaration contexts and type contexts in which an annotation type may be
31  * applicable are specified in JLS 9.6.4.1, and denoted in source code by enum
32  * constants of {@link ElementType java.lang.annotation.ElementType}.
33  *
34  * &lt;p&gt;If an {@code @Target} meta-annotation is not present on an annotation type
35  * {@code T}, then an annotation of type {@code T} may be written as a
36  * modifier for any declaration except a type parameter declaration.
37  *
38  * &lt;p&gt;If an {@code @Target} meta-annotation is present, the compiler will enforce
39  * the usage restrictions indicated by {@code ElementType}
40  * enum constants, in line with JLS 9.7.4.
41  *
42  * &lt;p&gt;For example, this {@code @Target} meta-annotation indicates that the
43  * declared type is itself a meta-annotation type.  It can only be used on
44  * annotation type declarations:
45  * &lt;pre&gt;
46  *    &amp;#064;Target(ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE)
47  *    public &amp;#064;interface MetaAnnotationType {
48  *        ...
49  *    }
50  * &lt;/pre&gt;
51  *
52  * &lt;p&gt;This {@code @Target} meta-annotation indicates that the declared type is
53  * intended solely for use as a member type in complex annotation type
54  * declarations.  It cannot be used to annotate anything directly:
55  * &lt;pre&gt;
56  *    &amp;#064;Target({})
57  *    public &amp;#064;interface MemberType {
58  *        ...
59  *    }
60  * &lt;/pre&gt;
61  *
62  * &lt;p&gt;It is a compile-time error for a single {@code ElementType} constant to
63  * appear more than once in an {@code @Target} annotation.  For example, the
64  * following {@code @Target} meta-annotation is illegal:
65  * &lt;pre&gt;
66  *    &amp;#064;Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.FIELD})
67  *    public &amp;#064;interface Bogus {
68  *        ...
69  *    }
70  * &lt;/pre&gt;
71  *
72  * @since 1.5
73  * @jls 9.6.4.1 @Target
74  * @jls 9.7.4 Where Annotations May Appear
75  * @jls 9.7.5 Multiple Annotations of the Same Type
