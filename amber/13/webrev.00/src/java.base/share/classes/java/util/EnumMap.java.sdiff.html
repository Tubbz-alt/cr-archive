 31  * A specialized {@link Map} implementation for use with enum type keys.  All
 32  * of the keys in an enum map must come from a single enum type that is
 33  * specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the map is created.  Enum maps
 34  * are represented internally as arrays.  This representation is extremely
 35  * compact and efficient.
 36  *
 37  * &lt;p&gt;Enum maps are maintained in the &lt;i&gt;natural order&lt;/i&gt; of their keys
 38  * (the order in which the enum constants are declared).  This is reflected
 39  * in the iterators returned by the collections views ({@link #keySet()},
 40  * {@link #entrySet()}, and {@link #values()}).
 41  *
 42  * &lt;p&gt;Iterators returned by the collection views are &lt;i&gt;weakly consistent&lt;/i&gt;:
 43  * they will never throw {@link ConcurrentModificationException} and they may
 44  * or may not show the effects of any modifications to the map that occur while
 45  * the iteration is in progress.
 46  *
 47  * &lt;p&gt;Null keys are not permitted.  Attempts to insert a null key will
 48  * throw {@link NullPointerException}.  Attempts to test for the
 49  * presence of a null key or to remove one will, however, function properly.
 50  * Null values are permitted.
<span class="line-modified"> 51 </span>
 52  * &lt;P&gt;Like most collection implementations {@code EnumMap} is not
 53  * synchronized. If multiple threads access an enum map concurrently, and at
 54  * least one of the threads modifies the map, it should be synchronized
 55  * externally.  This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some
 56  * object that naturally encapsulates the enum map.  If no such object exists,
 57  * the map should be &quot;wrapped&quot; using the {@link Collections#synchronizedMap}
 58  * method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 59  * unsynchronized access:
 60  *
 61  * &lt;pre&gt;
 62  *     Map&amp;lt;EnumKey, V&amp;gt; m
 63  *         = Collections.synchronizedMap(new EnumMap&amp;lt;EnumKey, V&amp;gt;(...));
 64  * &lt;/pre&gt;
 65  *
 66  * &lt;p&gt;Implementation note: All basic operations execute in constant time.
 67  * They are likely (though not guaranteed) to be faster than their
 68  * {@link HashMap} counterparts.
 69  *
