  63  * shift distance results in a left shift, and vice-versa.  The unsigned
  64  * right shift operator ({@code &gt;&gt;&gt;}) is omitted since this operation
  65  * only makes sense for a fixed sized word and not for a
  66  * representation conceptually having an infinite number of leading
  67  * virtual sign bits.
  68  *
  69  * &lt;p&gt;Semantics of bitwise logical operations exactly mimic those of Java&#39;s
  70  * bitwise integer operators.  The binary operators ({@code and},
  71  * {@code or}, {@code xor}) implicitly perform sign extension on the shorter
  72  * of the two operands prior to performing the operation.
  73  *
  74  * &lt;p&gt;Comparison operations perform signed integer comparisons, analogous to
  75  * those performed by Java&#39;s relational and equality operators.
  76  *
  77  * &lt;p&gt;Modular arithmetic operations are provided to compute residues, perform
  78  * exponentiation, and compute multiplicative inverses.  These methods always
  79  * return a non-negative result, between {@code 0} and {@code (modulus - 1)},
  80  * inclusive.
  81  *
  82  * &lt;p&gt;Bit operations operate on a single bit of the two&#39;s-complement
<span class="line-modified">  83  * representation of their operand.  If necessary, the operand is sign-</span>
<span class="line-modified">  84  * extended so that it contains the designated bit.  None of the single-bit</span>
  85  * operations can produce a BigInteger with a different sign from the
  86  * BigInteger being operated on, as they affect only a single bit, and the
  87  * arbitrarily large abstraction provided by this class ensures that conceptually
  88  * there are infinitely many &quot;virtual sign bits&quot; preceding each BigInteger.
  89  *
  90  * &lt;p&gt;For the sake of brevity and clarity, pseudo-code is used throughout the
  91  * descriptions of BigInteger methods.  The pseudo-code expression
  92  * {@code (i + j)} is shorthand for &quot;a BigInteger whose value is
  93  * that of the BigInteger {@code i} plus that of the BigInteger {@code j}.&quot;
  94  * The pseudo-code expression {@code (i == j)} is shorthand for
  95  * &quot;{@code true} if and only if the BigInteger {@code i} represents the same
  96  * value as the BigInteger {@code j}.&quot;  Other pseudo-code expressions are
  97  * interpreted similarly.
