 40  *   &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One thread starts one or more child threads and waits until the
 41  *   child threads to be started.
 42  *
 43  *   &lt;li&gt;One thread starts one or more child threads and waits until at least
 44  *   one of the child threads to be started.
 45  *
 46  *   &lt;li&gt;One or more child threads wait until a main thread lets them
 47  *   to finish.
 48  *
 49  *   &lt;li&gt;Disable the current thread for thread scheduling purposes, for up to
 50  *   the specified waiting time.&lt;/ul&gt;
