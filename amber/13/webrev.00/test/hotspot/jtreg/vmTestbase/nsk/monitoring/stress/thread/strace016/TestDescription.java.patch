  *     state after reaching 200 depth and checks up their stack traces
- *     and states gotten via the ThreadMBean interface.
+ *     and states gotten via the ThreadMXBean interface.
  *     Executable class of the test is the same as for the strace013 test.
  *     In contrast to the strace013 test, the strace016 test is performed for
  *     the case when recursive method is native and pure java by turn.
  *     Access to the management metrics is accomplished by DIRECTLY calling
  *     the methods in the MBean.
