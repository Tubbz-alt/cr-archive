32  * DESCRIPTION
33  *     The test starts 50 recursive threads, switches them  to the various
34  *     state after reaching 200 depth and checks up their stack traces
35  *     and states gotten via the ThreadMXBean interface.
36  *     Access to the management metrics is accomplished by DIRECTLY calling
37  *     the methods in the MBean.
38  * COMMENTS
39  *     Fixed the bug:
40  *     4953476 TEST_BUG: The spec is updated accoring to 4944573 and 4947536
41  *     Fixed the bug:
42  *     4969687 TEST_BUG: The spec is updated accoring to 4956978, 4957000, 4959889
43  *     Reduced recursion depth value up to 100 because the test fails
44  *     due to timeout in -Xint mode on solaris-sparc(Sun Ultra-10, 333 MHz, 256Mb)
45  *     Adjusted according to
46  *     5014783 Move ThreadState class from java.lang.management to java.lang
