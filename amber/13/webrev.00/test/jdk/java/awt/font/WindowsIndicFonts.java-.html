31  * This isn&#39;t just testing Indic fonts, a few other Asian scripts are
32  * also being verified.
33  * Oracle JDK for Windows had supported Devanagari and Thai in the logical
34  * fonts using a proprietary font, since Windows did not have such fonts.
35  * Since that was first added Microsoft added into Windows 7 a
36  * number of fonts to support Indic + other Asian scripts.
37  * By referencing these in the fontconfig.properties files we can enure that
38  * these scripts are supported by the logical fonts when using OpenJDK for
39  * Windows.
40  * The test here just verifies that at least one required code point from each
41  * of these scripts is available to make sure we don&#39;t regress, or to catch
42  * and understand cases where those fonts may not be installed.
