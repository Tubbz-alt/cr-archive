 22 Here are tests that were developed for &quot;G1 support for long running applications&quot; feature. In effect,
 23  here is only one test with a lot of configurations.
 24 
 25 Feature description:
 26   G1 used to unload classes only during full collections. Goal of feature is to unload unused classes
 27  without resorting to full gc.
 28 
 29 What does test checks:
 30   - that unreferenced classloader will be collected without full gc. This is checked with WhiteBox.is
 31 ClassAlive method.
 32   - that referenced classloader will live. This is checked with WhiteBox.isClassAlive method as well.
 33  Also it is checked that classloader will be finalized and enqueued to queue of phantom references.
 34 
 35 In what aspects/circumstances checks performed:
 36   - classloaders that we expect to be collected can be comlpetely unreferenced, referenced with phant
 37 om reference and with weak reference. Test can check that presence of phantom/weak reference doesn&#39;t
 38 keep classloader alive.
 39       Test has flag &quot;-referenceMode&quot; that has valid options:
 40           &quot;phantom&quot; for phantom reference,
 41           &quot;weak&quot; for weak reference and
 42           &quot;none&quot; for not keeping reference at all.
 43   - to avoid class unloading we can keep reference to classloader itself, class or object.
 44       This behavior can be adjusted with flag &quot;-keep&quot; that has valid options:
 45           &quot;classloader&quot;,
 46           &quot;class&quot; and
 47           &quot;object&quot;.
 48   - according to test plan several ways of classloading are covered.
 49       This behavior is adjusted with &quot;classloadingMethod&quot; flag that has valid options
 50           &quot;plain&quot;,
 51           &quot;reflection&quot;,
 52           &quot;jni&quot;,
 53           &quot;anonymous_classloader&quot;.
 54   - classloaders that we expect to live can be referenced in several ways.
 55       This behavior can be adjusted with flag &quot;-keepRefMode&quot; that has valid options:
 56 	  &quot;strong_reference&quot; for starighforward keeping strong reference,
 57 	  &quot;static_field&quot; for keeping reference in static field of alive class,
 58 	  &quot;stack_local&quot; for keeping reference in local variable of running thread,
 59 	  &quot;thread_field&quot; for keeping reference in field of running thread&#39;s object,
 60 	  &quot;thread_itself&quot; if we want object to be a running thread itself,
 61 	  &quot;static_field_of_root_class&quot;. In this case reference will be kept in static field of class that wa
 62 s loaded by null classloader.
 63 	  &quot;jni_global_ref&quot;. In this case global reference will be kept in native library.
 64 	  &quot;jni_local_ref&quot;, In this case local reference will be kept in JNI call in running thread.
 65   - Another aspect is that class can be humongous.
 66       Humongous classes can be enabled with &quot;-humongousClass&quot; command line option. Valid options are
 67 &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;.
 68   - Another aspect that is covered with tests is that class methods can be compiled by JIT compiler.
 69       This behavior can be adjusted with &quot;-compilationLevel&quot; and &quot;-compilationNumber&quot; options. First
 70 one has self-explaining name, latter sets number of optimization/deoptimozation of each class.
 71   - Next aspect is class redefinition.
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified"> 72       You can enable classes redefinition with &quot;-redefineClasses&quot; flag. Valid options are &quot;true&quot; and</span>
<span class="line-added"> 73 &quot;false&quot;.</span>
 74 
 75 Test implementation details:
 76   Test supposed to be ran with G1 gc and -XX:+ExplicitGCProvokesConcurrent option. In the end of exec
 77 ution test checks if full gc happened. If this is the case the test throws descriptive exception and
 78 fails.
 79 
 80 Test guts design:
 81   Test in loop performs the following until time is over (timelimit is set up with &quot;-stressTime&quot; opti
 82 on):
 83 	- loads class that gonna live or gonna be unloaded. Decision depends upon Random.nextBoolean().
 84 	- previous action produces collection of Assertions (what assertion is is explained a little bit lat
 85 er). Assertions are saved into AssertionContainer.
 86 	- takes from AssertionContainer assertions that are already mature for check and performs checks. &quot;M
 87 ature&quot; means that required number of System.gc() calls happened since assertion was created.
 88 
 89 What &quot;Assertion&quot; is:
 90  Assertion incapsulates check that concrete class will be alive or dead. Hazard is that we can&#39;t perf
 91 orm check just after we removed last reference to classloader. We have to wait some number of concurr
 92 ent-mark-cycles, i.e. System.gc() calls. For this reason we put each assertion in AssertionContainer
 93 and get back much later, when it&#39;s ready for check.
 94  Classes of assertions form the following simple hierarchy:
 95 
 96                               gc.g1.unloading.check.Assertion
 97                               ||             ||            ||
 98                               \/             ||            \/
 99   gc.g1.unloading.check.FinalizedAssertion   ||           gc.g1.unloading.check.PhantomizedAssertion
100                                              \/
101                         gc.g1.unloading.check.ClassAssertion
102 
103 FinalizedAssertion checks that unreferenced classloader will be finalized.
104 PhantomizedAssertion checks that phantom reference to classloader will be enqueued to ReferenceQueue.
105 ClassAssertion checks that class will be dead or alive using WhiteBox.isClassAlive method.
106 
107 Other implemention notes:
108   There are some other auxiliary threads, but they are not crucial for understanding the logic.
109   There are a lot of configurations of the same test in testlist. All configurations use the same mai
110 n method as entry point, but impose different test flags. Configurations are autogenerated with &quot;gene
111 rate.sh&quot; script.
112 
113 Other test options:
114 	-DFailTestIfNothingChecked=true. (vm flag) Set this if you want test to fail if nothing was checked
115 and test appeared to be useless. It can happen, for example, in slow modes that force compilation.
116 	-numberOfChecksLimit. (test flag) Set this number if you want test to pass after certain number of c
117 hecks performed. (Not to waste time.) To some extent this turns stress test into functional test.
118 	-numberOfGCsBeforeCheck. (test flag) This option sets number of System.gc() calls that have to be do
119 ne before each assertion will be ready to perform checks.
120 	-inMemoryCompilation. (test flag) This option defines the way of classes creation. If this is true t
121 hen classes are compiled with javac API. If false - classes are produced by rewriting classname in &quot;g
122 olden&quot; bytecode.
