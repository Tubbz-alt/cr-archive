+ * Visitor classes directly implementing this interface may be source

+ * source incompatibility, visitor implementations are encouraged to
+ * instead extend the appropriate abstract visitor class that
+ * implements this interface.  However, an API should generally use
+ * this visitor interface as the type for parameters, return type,
+ * etc. rather than one of the abstract classes.
+ *
+ * <p>Methods to accommodate new language constructs are expected to
+ * be added as default methods to provide strong source
+ * compatibility. The implementations of the default methods will in
+ * turn call {@link visitUnknown visitUnknown}, behavior that will be
+ * overridden in concrete visitors supporting the source version with
+ * the new language construct.
+ *
+ * <p>There are several families of classes implementing this visitor
+ * interface in the {@linkplain javax.lang.model.util util
+ * package}. The families follow a naming pattern along the lines of
+ * {@code FooVisitor}<i>N</i> where <i>N</i> indicates the
+ * {@linkplain javax.lang.model.SourceVersion source version} the
+ * visitor is appropriate for.
+ *
+ * In particular, a {@code FooVisitor}<i>N</i> is expected to handle
+ * all language constructs present in source version <i>N</i>. If
+ * there are no new language constructs added in version
+ * <i>N</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 (or subsequent releases), {@code
+ * FooVisitor}<i>N</i> may also handle that later source version; in
+ * that case, the {@link
+ * javax.annotation.processing.SupportedSourceVersion
+ * SupportedSourceVersion} annotation on the {@code
+ * FooVisitor}<i>N</i> class will indicate a later version.
+ *
+ * When visiting a type representing a language construct
+ * introduced <strong>after</strong> source version <i>N</i>, a {@code
+ * FooVisitor}<i>N</i> will throw an {@link UnknownTypeException}
+ * unless that behavior is overridden.
+ *
+ * <p>When choosing which member of a visitor family to subclass,
+ * subclassing the most recent one increases the range of source
+ * versions covered. When choosing which visitor family to subclass,
+ * consider their built-in capabilities:
+ *
+ * <ul>
+ *
+ * <li>{@link AbstractTypeVisitor6 AbstractTypeVisitor}s:
+ * Skeletal visitor implementations.
+ *
+ * <li>{@link SimpleTypeVisitor6 SimpleTypeVisitor}s: Support

+ * <li>{@link TypeKindVisitor6 TypeKindVisitor}s: Visit methods
