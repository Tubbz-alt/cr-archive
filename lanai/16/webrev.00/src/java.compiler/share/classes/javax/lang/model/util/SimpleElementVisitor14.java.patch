- * <p> Methods in this class may be overridden subject to their
- * general contract.  Note that annotating methods in concrete
- * subclasses with {@link java.lang.Override @Override} will help
- * ensure that methods are overridden as intended.

- * <p> <b>WARNING:</b> The {@code ElementVisitor} interface
- * implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the
- * future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures
- * added to future versions of the Java&trade; programming language.
- * Therefore, methods whose names begin with {@code "visit"} may be
- * added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
- * classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
- * methods with names beginning with {@code "visit"}.
- *
- * <p>When such a new visit method is added, the default
- * implementation in this class will be to call the {@link
- * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new simple element visitor
- * class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language
- * level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the
- * visit method in question.  When the new visitor is introduced, all
- * or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.

  * @param <R> the return type of this visitor's methods.  Use {@code Void}

  * @param <P> the type of the additional parameter to this visitor's methods.  Use {@code Void}
  *              for visitors that do not need an additional parameter.
