  The simplest way to run tests with JCov coverage report is to use the special
  target `jcov-test` instead of `test`, e.g. `make jcov-test TEST=jdk_lang`. This
  will make sure the JCov image is built, and that JCov reporting is enabled.
  
<span class="line-modified">! The JCov report is stored in `build/$BUILD/test-results/jcov-output`.</span>
  
  Please note that running with JCov reporting can be very memory intensive.
