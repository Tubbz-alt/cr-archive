 <h4 id="jcov">JCOV</h4>
 <p>This keywords applies globally to the test runner system. If set to <code>true</code>, it enables JCov coverage reporting for all tests run. To be useful, the JDK under test must be run with a JDK built with JCov instrumentation (<code>configure --with-jcov=&lt;path to directory containing lib/jcov.jar&gt;</code>, <code>make jcov-image</code>).</p>
 <p>The simplest way to run tests with JCov coverage report is to use the special target <code>jcov-test</code> instead of <code>test</code>, e.g. <code>make jcov-test TEST=jdk_lang</code>. This will make sure the JCov image is built, and that JCov reporting is enabled.</p>
 <p>The JCov report is stored in <code>build/$BUILD/test-results/jcov-output</code>.</p>
 <p>Please note that running with JCov reporting can be very memory intensive.</p>
+<h4 id="jcov_diff_changeset">JCOV_DIFF_CHANGESET</h4>
+<p>While collecting code coverage with JCov, it is also possible to find coverage for only recently changed code. JCOV_DIFF_CHANGESET specifies a source revision. A textual report will be generated showing coverage of the diff between the specified revision and the repository tip.</p>
+<p>The report is stored in <code>build/$BUILD/test-results/jcov-output/diff_coverage_report</code> file.</p>

 <h4 id="jobs-1">JOBS</h4>
 <p>The test concurrency (<code>-concurrency</code>).</p>
 <p>Defaults to TEST_JOBS (if set by <code>--with-test-jobs=</code>), otherwise it defaults to JOBS, except for Hotspot, where the default is <em>number of CPU cores/2</em> (for sparc, if more than 16 cpus, then <em>number of CPU cores/5</em>, otherwise <em>number of CPU cores/4</em>), but never more than <em>memory size in GB/2</em>.</p>
