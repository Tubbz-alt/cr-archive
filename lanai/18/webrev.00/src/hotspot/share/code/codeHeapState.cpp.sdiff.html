  32 // |  General Description  |
  33 // -------------------------
  34 // The CodeHeap state analytics are divided in two parts.
  35 // The first part examines the entire CodeHeap and aggregates all
  36 // information that is believed useful/important.
  37 //
  38 // Aggregation condenses the information of a piece of the CodeHeap
  39 // (4096 bytes by default) into an analysis granule. These granules
  40 // contain enough detail to gain initial insight while keeping the
  41 // internal structure sizes in check.
  42 //
  43 // The second part, which consists of several, independent steps,
  44 // prints the previously collected information with emphasis on
  45 // various aspects.
  46 //
  47 // The CodeHeap is a living thing. Therefore, protection against concurrent
  48 // modification (by acquiring the CodeCache_lock) is necessary. It has
  49 // to be provided by the caller of the analysis functions.
