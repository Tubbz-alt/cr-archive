 ### Mozilla ECC Notice
 
-This notice is provided with respect to Elliptic Curve Cryptography,
-which is included with JRE, JDK, and OpenJDK.
-
-You are receiving a [copy](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/jdk9/jdk/file/tip/src/jdk.crypto.ec/share/native/libsunec/impl)
-of the Elliptic Curve Cryptography library in source
-form with the JDK and OpenJDK source distributions, and as object code in
-the JRE & JDK runtimes.
-<pre>
-In the case of the JRE & JDK runtimes, the terms of the Oracle license do
-NOT apply to the Elliptic Curve Cryptography library; it is licensed under the
-following license, separately from Oracle's JDK & JRE.  If you do not wish to
-install the Elliptic Curve Cryptography library, you may delete the
-Elliptic Curve Cryptography library:
-   - On Solaris and Linux systems: delete $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/libsunec.so
-   - On Mac OSX systems: delete $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/libsunec.dylib
-   - On Windows systems: delete $(JAVA_HOME)\bin\sunec.dll

-For third party technology that you receive from Oracle in binary form 
-which is licensed under an open source license that gives you the right
-to receive the source code for that binary, you can obtain a copy of 
-the applicable source code from this page:
-    http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/jdk9/jdk/file/tip/src/jdk.crypto.ec/share/native/libsunec/impl
-
-If the source code for the technology was not provided to you with the 
-binary, you can also receive a copy of the source code on physical 
-media by submitting a written request to:
