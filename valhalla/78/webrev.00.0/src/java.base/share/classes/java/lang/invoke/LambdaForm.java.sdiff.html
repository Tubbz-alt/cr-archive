 788      * Also, for direct MHs, the MemberName of the target
 789      * could be erased, and loaded from the containing direct MH.
 790      * As a simple case, a LF for all int-valued non-static
 791      * field getters would perform a cast on its input argument
 792      * (to non-constant base type derived from the MemberName)
 793      * and load an integer value from the input object
 794      * (at a non-constant offset also derived from the MemberName).
 795      * Such MN-erased LFs would be inlinable back to optimized
 796      * code, whenever a constant enclosing DMH is available
 797      * to supply a constant MN from its data.
 798      *
 799      * The main problem here is to keep LFs reasonably generic,
 800      * while ensuring that hot spots will inline good instances.
 801      * &quot;Reasonably generic&quot; means that we don&#39;t end up with
 802      * repeated versions of bytecode or machine code that do
 803      * not differ in their optimized form.  Repeated versions
 804      * of machine would have the undesirable overheads of
 805      * (a) redundant compilation work and (b) extra I$ pressure.
 806      * To control repeated versions, we need to be ready to
 807      * erase details from LFs and move them into MH data,
<span class="line-modified"> 808      * whevener those details are not relevant to significant</span>
 809      * optimization.  &quot;Significant&quot; means optimization of
 810      * code that is actually hot.
 811      *
 812      * Achieving this may require dynamic splitting of MHs, by replacing
 813      * a generic LF with a more specialized one, on the same MH,
 814      * if (a) the MH is frequently executed and (b) the MH cannot
 815      * be inlined into a containing caller, such as an invokedynamic.
 816      *
 817      * Compiled LFs that are no longer used should be GC-able.
 818      * If they contain non-BCP references, they should be properly
 819      * interlinked with the class loader(s) that their embedded types
 820      * depend on.  This probably means that reusable compiled LFs
 821      * will be tabulated (indexed) on relevant class loaders,
 822      * or else that the tables that cache them will have weak links.
