185      * the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}
186      * need to be modified.
187      * &lt;p&gt;

189      * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
190      * not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a
191      * {@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arrays
192      * are considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that
193      * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
194      * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
195      * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
196      * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
197      * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
198      * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
199      * performs a &quot;shallow copy&quot; of this object, not a &quot;deep copy&quot; operation.
200      * &lt;p&gt;
201      * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
202      * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object

365      * &lt;li&gt;Some other thread invokes the {@code notify} method for this
366      * object and thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; happens to be arbitrarily chosen as
367      * the thread to be awakened.
368      * &lt;li&gt;Some other thread invokes the {@code notifyAll} method for this
369      * object.
370      * &lt;li&gt;Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupts}
371      * thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt;.
372      * &lt;li&gt;The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less.
373      * The amount of real time, in nanoseconds, is given by the expression
374      * {@code 1000000 * timeoutMillis + nanos}. If {@code timeoutMillis} and {@code nanos}
375      * are both zero, then real time is not taken into consideration and the
376      * thread waits until awakened by one of the other causes.
377      * &lt;li&gt;Thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; is awakened spuriously. (See below.)
378      * &lt;/ul&gt;
379      * &lt;p&gt;
380      * The thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; is then removed from the wait set for this
381      * object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It competes in the
382      * usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the
383      * object; once it has regained control of the object, all its
384      * synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo
385      * ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the {@code wait}
386      * method was invoked. Thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; then returns from the
387      * invocation of the {@code wait} method. Thus, on return from the
388      * {@code wait} method, the synchronization state of the object and of
389      * thread {@code T} is exactly as it was when the {@code wait} method
390      * was invoked.
391      * &lt;p&gt;
392      * A thread can wake up without being notified, interrupted, or timing out, a
393      * so-called &lt;em&gt;spurious wakeup&lt;/em&gt;.  While this will rarely occur in practice,
394      * applications must guard against it by testing for the condition that should
395      * have caused the thread to be awakened, and continuing to wait if the condition
396      * is not satisfied. See the example below.
397      * &lt;p&gt;
398      * For more information on this topic, see section 14.2,
399      * &quot;Condition Queues,&quot; in Brian Goetz and others&#39; &lt;em&gt;Java Concurrency
400      * in Practice&lt;/em&gt; (Addison-Wesley, 2006) or Item 69 in Joshua
401      * Bloch&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Effective Java, Second Edition&lt;/em&gt; (Addison-Wesley,
402      * 2008).
403      * &lt;p&gt;
404      * If the current thread is {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#interrupt() interrupted}
405      * by any thread before or while it is waiting, then an {@code InterruptedException}
406      * is thrown.  The &lt;em&gt;interrupted status&lt;/em&gt; of the current thread is cleared when
407      * this exception is thrown. This exception is not thrown until the lock status of
408      * this object has been restored as described above.
409      *
410      * @apiNote
411      * The recommended approach to waiting is to check the condition being awaited in
412      * a {@code while} loop around the call to {@code wait}, as shown in the example
413      * below. Among other things, this approach avoids problems that can be caused
414      * by spurious wakeups.

459      * Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
460      * determines that there are no more references to the object.
461      * A subclass overrides the {@code finalize} method to dispose of
462      * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
463      * &lt;p&gt;
464      * The general contract of {@code finalize} is that it is invoked
465      * if and when the Java&amp;trade; virtual
466      * machine has determined that there is no longer any
467      * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
468      * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
469      * finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
470      * finalized. The {@code finalize} method may take any action, including
471      * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
472      * of {@code finalize}, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
473      * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
474      * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
475      * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
476      * permanently discarded.
477      * &lt;p&gt;
478      * The {@code finalize} method of class {@code Object} performs no
479      * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
480      * {@code Object} may override this definition.
481      * &lt;p&gt;
482      * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
483      * invoke the {@code finalize} method for any given object. It is
484      * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
485      * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
486      * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
487      * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
488      * &lt;p&gt;
489      * After the {@code finalize} method has been invoked for an object, no
490      * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
491      * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
492      * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
493      * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
494      * at which point the object may be discarded.
495      * &lt;p&gt;
496      * The {@code finalize} method is never invoked more than once by a Java
497      * virtual machine for any given object.
498      * &lt;p&gt;
499      * Any exception thrown by the {@code finalize} method causes
500      * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
501      * ignored.
502      *
503      * @apiNote
504      * Classes that embed non-heap resources have many options
505      * for cleanup of those resources. The class must ensure that the
506      * lifetime of each instance is longer than that of any resource it embeds.
507      * {@link java.lang.ref.Reference#reachabilityFence} can be used to ensure that
508      * objects remain reachable while resources embedded in the object are in use.
509      * &lt;p&gt;
510      * A subclass should avoid overriding the {@code finalize} method
511      * unless the subclass embeds non-heap resources that must be cleaned up
512      * before the instance is collected.
513      * Finalizer invocations are not automatically chained, unlike constructors.
514      * If a subclass overrides {@code finalize} it must invoke the superclass
515      * finalizer explicitly.
516      * To guard against exceptions prematurely terminating the finalize chain,
517      * the subclass should use a {@code try-finally} block to ensure
518      * {@code super.finalize()} is always invoked. For example,
519      * &lt;pre&gt;{@code      @Override
520      *     protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
521      *         try {
522      *             ... // cleanup subclass state
523      *         } finally {
524      *             super.finalize();
525      *         }
526      *     }
527      * }&lt;/pre&gt;
528      *
529      * @deprecated The finalization mechanism is inherently problematic.
530      * Finalization can lead to performance issues, deadlocks, and hangs.
531      * Errors in finalizers can lead to resource leaks; there is no way to cancel
532      * finalization if it is no longer necessary; and no ordering is specified
533      * among calls to {@code finalize} methods of different objects.
534      * Furthermore, there are no guarantees regarding the timing of finalization.
535      * The {@code finalize} method might be called on a finalizable object
536      * only after an indefinite delay, if at all.
537      *
538      * Classes whose instances hold non-heap resources should provide a method
539      * to enable explicit release of those resources, and they should also
540      * implement {@link AutoCloseable} if appropriate.
541      * The {@link java.lang.ref.Cleaner} and {@link java.lang.ref.PhantomReference}
542      * provide more flexible and efficient ways to release resources when an object
543      * becomes unreachable.
