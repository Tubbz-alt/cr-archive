 11  * An inline cursor is a reference to an existing or non-existent element
 12  * of a collection.
 13  * &lt;p&gt;
 14  * Cursor values are immutable, the reference to an element
 15  * does not change but the state of the collection can change
 16  * so the element is no longer accessible.
 17  * Calling {@link #get()} throws a {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.
 18  * Iterating through a Collection proceeds by creating new Cursor
 19  * from the Collection or advancing to the next or retreating to previous elements.
 20  * Advancing past the end of the Collection or retreating before the beginning
 21  * results in Cursor values that are non-existent.
 22  * A Cursor for an empty Collection does not refer to an element and
 23  * throws {@link NoSuchElementException}.
 24  * Modifications to the Collection invalidate every Cursor that was created
 25  * before the modification.
 26  * The typical traversal pattern is:
 27  * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 28  *  Collection&lt;T&gt; c = ...;
 29  *  for (var cursor = c.cursor(); cursor.exists(); cursor = cursor.advance()) {
 30  *      var el = cursor.get();
 31  *  }
 32  * }
 33  * &lt;/pre&gt;
 34  * &lt;p&gt;
 35  * Cursors can be used to {@link #remove()} remove an element from the collection.
 36  * Removing an element modifies the collection making that cursor invalid.
 37  * The cursor returned from the {@link #remove()} method is a placeholder
 38  * for the position, the element occupied, between the next and previous elements.
 39  * It can be moved to the next or previous element to continue the iteration.
 40  * &lt;p&gt;
 41  * The typical traversal and remove pattern follows; when an element is
 42  * removed, the cursor returned from the remove is used to continue the iteration:
 43  * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 44  *  Collection&lt;T&gt; c = ...;
 45  *  for (var cursor = c.cursor(); cursor.exists(); cursor = cursor.advance()) {
 46  *      var el = cursor.get();
 47  *      if (el.equals(...)) {
 48  *          cursor = cursor.remove();
 49  *      }
 50  *  }
 51  * }
 52  * &lt;/pre&gt;
 53  * &lt;p&gt;
 54  * @param &lt;T&gt; the type of the element.
