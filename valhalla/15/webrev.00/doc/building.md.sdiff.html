 310 system should be independent factors, but in practice there&#39;s more or less a
 311 one-to-one correlation between target operating system and toolchain.
 312 
 313  Operating system   Supported toolchain
 314  ------------------ -------------------------
 315  Linux              gcc, clang
 316  macOS              Apple Xcode (using clang)
 317  Solaris            Oracle Solaris Studio
 318  AIX                IBM XL C/C++
 319  Windows            Microsoft Visual Studio
 320 
 321 Please see the individual sections on the toolchains for version
 322 recommendations. As a reference, these versions of the toolchains are used, at
 323 the time of writing, by Oracle for the daily builds of the JDK. It should be
 324 possible to compile the JDK with both older and newer versions, but the closer
 325 you stay to this list, the more likely you are to compile successfully without
 326 issues.
 327 
 328  Operating system   Toolchain version
 329  ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------
<span class="line-modified"> 330  Linux              gcc 8.3.0</span>
 331  macOS              Apple Xcode 10.1 (using clang 10.0.0)
 332  Solaris            Oracle Solaris Studio 12.6 (with compiler version 5.15)
 333  Windows            Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 update 15.9.16
 334 
 335 All compilers are expected to be able to compile to the C99 language standard,
 336 as some C99 features are used in the source code. Microsoft Visual Studio
 337 doesn&#39;t fully support C99 so in practice shared code is limited to using C99
 338 features that it does support.
 339 
 340 ### gcc
 341 
 342 The minimum accepted version of gcc is 5.0. Older versions will generate a warning
 343 by `configure` and are unlikely to work.
 344 
<span class="line-modified"> 345 The JDK is currently known to be able to compile with at least version 8.3 of</span>
 346 gcc.
 347 
 348 In general, any version between these two should be usable.
 349 
 350 ### clang
 351 
 352 The minimum accepted version of clang is 3.2. Older versions will not be
 353 accepted by `configure`.
 354 
 355 To use clang instead of gcc on Linux, use `--with-toolchain-type=clang`.
 356 
 357 ### Apple Xcode
 358 
 359 The oldest supported version of Xcode is 8.
 360 
 361 You will need the Xcode command lines developers tools to be able to build
 362 the JDK. (Actually, *only* the command lines tools are needed, not the IDE.)
 363 The simplest way to install these is to run:
 364 ```
 365 xcode-select --install
