  2 
  3 ### Mozilla ECC Notice
  4 
  5 This notice is provided with respect to Elliptic Curve Cryptography,
  6 which is included with JRE, JDK, and OpenJDK.
  7 
  8 You are receiving a [copy](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/jdk9/jdk/file/tip/src/jdk.crypto.ec/share/native/libsunec/impl)
  9 of the Elliptic Curve Cryptography library in source
 10 form with the JDK and OpenJDK source distributions, and as object code in
 11 the JRE &amp; JDK runtimes.
 12 &lt;pre&gt;
 13 In the case of the JRE &amp; JDK runtimes, the terms of the Oracle license do
 14 NOT apply to the Elliptic Curve Cryptography library; it is licensed under the
 15 following license, separately from Oracle&#39;s JDK &amp; JRE.  If you do not wish to
 16 install the Elliptic Curve Cryptography library, you may delete the
 17 Elliptic Curve Cryptography library:
 18    - On Solaris and Linux systems: delete $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/libsunec.so
 19    - On Mac OSX systems: delete $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/libsunec.dylib
 20    - On Windows systems: delete $(JAVA_HOME)\bin\sunec.dll
 21 
 22 &lt;/pre&gt;

 73 &lt;pre&gt;
 74 
 75                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 76                        Version 2.1, February 1999
 77 
 78  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 79  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 80  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 81  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 82 
 83 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 84  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 85  the version number 2.1.]
 86 
 87                             Preamble
 88 
 89   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 90 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 91 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 92 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 93 
 94   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 95 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 96 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 97 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 98 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 99 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
100 
101   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
102 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
103 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
104 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
105 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
106 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
107 these things.
108 
109   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
110 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
111 rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
112 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
113 
114   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
115 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
116 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
117 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
118 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
119 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
120 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
121 
122   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
123 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
124 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
125 
126   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
127 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
128 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
129 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
130 author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
131 introduced by others.
132 
133   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
134 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
135 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
136 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
137 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
138 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
139 
140   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
141 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
142 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
143 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
144 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
145 libraries into non-free programs.
146 
147   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
148 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
149 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
150 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
151 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
152 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
153 the library.
154 
155   We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
156 does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General
157 Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
158 of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
159 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
160 libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
161 special circumstances.
162 
163   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
164 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
165 a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
166 allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
167 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
168 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
169 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
170 
171   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
172 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
173 free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
174 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
175 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
176 system.
177 
178   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
179 users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
180 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
181 that program using a modified version of the Library.
182 
183   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
184 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
185 &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
186 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
187 be combined with the library in order to run.
188 
189                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
190    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
191 
192   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
193 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
194 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
195 this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
196 Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
197 
198   A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
199 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
200 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
201 
202   The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
203 which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
204 Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
205 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
206 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
207 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
208 included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
209 
210   &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
211 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
212 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
213 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
214 and installation of the library.
215 
216   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
217 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
218 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
219 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
220 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
221 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
222 and what the program that uses the Library does.
223 
224   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s
225 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
226 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
227 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
228 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
229 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
230 Library.
231 
232   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
233 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
234 fee.
235 
236   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
237 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
238 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
239 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
240 
241     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
242 
243     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
244     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
245 
246     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
247     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
248 
249     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
250     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
251     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
252     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
253     in the event an application does not supply such function or
254     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
255     its purpose remains meaningful.
256 
257     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
258     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
259     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
260     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
261     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
262     root function must still compute square roots.)
263 
264 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
265 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
266 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
267 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
268 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
269 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
270 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
271 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
272 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
273 it.
274 
275 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
276 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
277 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
278 collective works based on the Library.
279 
280 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
281 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
282 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
283 the scope of this License.
284 
285   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
286 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
287 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
288 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
289 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
290 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
291 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
292 these notices.
293 
294   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
295 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
296 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
297 
298   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
299 the Library into a program that is not a library.
300 
301   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
302 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
303 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
304 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
305 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
306 medium customarily used for software interchange.
307 
308   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
309 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
310 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
311 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
312 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
313 
314   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
315 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
316 linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
317 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
318 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
319 
320   However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
321 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
322 contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
323 library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
324 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
325 
326   When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
327 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
328 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
329 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
330 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
331 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
332 
333   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
334 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
335 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
336 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
337 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
338 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
339 
340   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
341 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
342 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
343 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
344 
345   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
346 link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
347 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
348 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
349 modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse
350 engineering for debugging such modifications.
351 
352   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
353 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
354 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
355 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
356 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
357 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
358 of these things:
359 
360     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
361     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
362     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
363     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
364     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
365     uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
366     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
367     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
368     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
369     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
370     to use the modified definitions.)
371 
372     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
373     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
374     copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,
375     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
376     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
377     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
378     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
379 
380     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
381     least three years, to give the same user the materials
382     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
383     than the cost of performing this distribution.
384 
385     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
386     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
387     specified materials from the same place.
388 
389     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
390     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
391 
392   For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
393 Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
394 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
395 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
396 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
397 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
398 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
399 the executable.
400 
401   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
402 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
403 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
404 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
405 distribute.
406 
407   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
408 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
409 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
410 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
411 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
412 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
413 
414     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
415     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
416     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
417     Sections above.
418 
419     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
420     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
421     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
422 
423   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
424 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
425 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
426 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
427 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
428 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
429 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
430 
431   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
432 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
433 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
434 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
435 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
436 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
437 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
438 the Library or works based on it.
439 
440   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
441 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
442 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
443 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
444 restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
445 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
446 this License.
447 
448   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
449 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
450 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
451 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
452 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
453 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
454 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
455 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
456 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
457 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
458 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
459 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
460 
461 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
462 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
463 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
464 
465 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
466 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
467 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
468 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
469 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
470 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
471 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
472 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
473 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
474 impose that choice.
475 
476 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
477 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
478 
479   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
480 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
481 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
482 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
483 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
484 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
485 written in the body of this License.
486 
487   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
488 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
489 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
490 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
491 
492 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
493 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
494 &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
495 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
496 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
497 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
498 the Free Software Foundation.
499 
500   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
501 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
502 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
503 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
504 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
505 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
506 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
507 and reuse of software generally.
508 
509                             NO WARRANTY
510 
511   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
512 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
513 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
514 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
515 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
516 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
517 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
518 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
519 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
520 
521   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
522 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
523 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
524 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
525 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
526 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
527 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
528 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
529 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
530 DAMAGES.
531 
532                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
533 
534            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
535 
536   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
537 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
538 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
539 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
540 ordinary General Public License).
541 
542   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
543 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
544 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
545 &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
546 
547     &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
548     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
549 
550     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
551     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
552     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
553     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
554 
555     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
556     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
557     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
558     Lesser General Public License for more details.
559 
560     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
561     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
562     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
563 
564 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
565 
566 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
567 school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if
568 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
569 
570   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
571   library `Frob&#39; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
572 
573   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
574   Ty Coon, President of Vice
575 
576 That&#39;s all there is to it!
