 100  * &lt;h2&gt;Getting and Setting Calendar Field Values&lt;/h2&gt;
 101  *
 102  * &lt;p&gt;The calendar field values can be set by calling the {@code set}
 103  * methods. Any field values set in a {@code Calendar} will not be
 104  * interpreted until it needs to calculate its time value (milliseconds from
 105  * the Epoch) or values of the calendar fields. Calling the
 106  * {@code get}, {@code getTimeInMillis}, {@code getTime},
 107  * {@code add} and {@code roll} involves such calculation.
 108  *
 109  * &lt;h3&gt;Leniency&lt;/h3&gt;
 110  *
 111  * &lt;p&gt;{@code Calendar} has two modes for interpreting the calendar
 112  * fields, &lt;em&gt;lenient&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;non-lenient&lt;/em&gt;.  When a
 113  * {@code Calendar} is in lenient mode, it accepts a wider range of
 114  * calendar field values than it produces.  When a {@code Calendar}
 115  * recomputes calendar field values for return by {@code get()}, all of
 116  * the calendar fields are normalized. For example, a lenient
 117  * {@code GregorianCalendar} interprets {@code MONTH == JANUARY},
 118  * {@code DAY_OF_MONTH == 32} as February 1.
<span class="line-modified"> 119 </span>
 120  * &lt;p&gt;When a {@code Calendar} is in non-lenient mode, it throws an
 121  * exception if there is any inconsistency in its calendar fields. For
 122  * example, a {@code GregorianCalendar} always produces
 123  * {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} values between 1 and the length of the month. A
 124  * non-lenient {@code GregorianCalendar} throws an exception upon
 125  * calculating its time or calendar field values if any out-of-range field
 126  * value has been set.
 127  *
 128  * &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;first_week&quot;&gt;First Week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 129  *
 130  * {@code Calendar} defines a locale-specific seven day week using two
 131  * parameters: the first day of the week and the minimal days in first week
 132  * (from 1 to 7).  These numbers are taken from the locale resource data or the
 133  * locale itself when a {@code Calendar} is constructed. If the designated
 134  * locale contains &quot;fw&quot; and/or &quot;rg&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;./Locale.html#def_locale_extension&quot;&gt;
 135  * Unicode extensions&lt;/a&gt;, the first day of the week will be obtained according to
 136  * those extensions. If both &quot;fw&quot; and &quot;rg&quot; are specified, the value from the &quot;fw&quot;
 137  * extension supersedes the implicit one from the &quot;rg&quot; extension.
 138  * They may also be specified explicitly through the methods for setting their
 139  * values.
