146  * If there are several such threads, the bootstrap method may be
147  * invoked in several threads concurrently.
148  * Therefore, bootstrap methods which access global application
149  * data must take the usual precautions against race conditions.
150  * In any case, every {@code invokedynamic} instruction is either
151  * unlinked or linked to a unique {@code CallSite} object.
152  * &lt;p&gt;
153  * In an application which requires {@code invokedynamic} instructions with individually
154  * mutable behaviors, their bootstrap methods should produce distinct
155  * {@link java.lang.invoke.CallSite CallSite} objects, one for each linkage request.
156  * Alternatively, an application can link a single {@code CallSite} object
157  * to several {@code invokedynamic} instructions, in which case
158  * a change to the target method will become visible at each of
159  * the instructions.
160  * &lt;p&gt;
161  * If several threads simultaneously execute a bootstrap method for a single dynamically-computed
162  * call site or constant, the JVM must choose one bootstrap method result and install it visibly to
163  * all threads.  Any other bootstrap method calls are allowed to complete, but their
164  * results are ignored.
<span class="line-removed">165 </span>
166  * &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:smaller;&quot;&gt;
167  * &lt;em&gt;Discussion:&lt;/em&gt;
168  * These rules do not enable the JVM to share call sites,
169  * or to issue &amp;ldquo;causeless&amp;rdquo; bootstrap method calls.
170  * Every {@code invokedynamic} instruction transitions at most once from unlinked to linked,
171  * just before its first invocation.
172  * There is no way to undo the effect of a completed bootstrap method call.
173  *
174  * &lt;h3&gt;Types of bootstrap methods&lt;/h3&gt;
175  * For a dynamically-computed call site, the bootstrap method is invoked with parameter
176  * types {@code MethodHandles.Lookup}, {@code String}, {@code MethodType}, and the types
177  * of any static arguments; the return type is {@code CallSite}.
178  * &lt;p&gt;
179  * For a dynamically-computed constant, the bootstrap method is invoked with parameter types
180  * {@code MethodHandles.Lookup}, {@code String}, {@code Class}, and the types of any
181  * static arguments; the return type is the type represented by the {@code Class}.
182  * &lt;p&gt;
183  * Because {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle#invoke MethodHandle.invoke} allows for
184  * adaptations between the invoked method type and the bootstrap method handle&#39;s method type,
185  * there is flexibility in the declaration of the bootstrap method.
