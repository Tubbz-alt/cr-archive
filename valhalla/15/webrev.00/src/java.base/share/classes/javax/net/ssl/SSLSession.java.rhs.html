 31  * In SSL, sessions are used to describe an ongoing relationship between
 32  * two entities.  Each SSL connection involves one session at a time, but
 33  * that session may be used on many connections between those entities,
 34  * simultaneously or sequentially.  The session used on a connection may
 35  * also be replaced by a different session.  Sessions are created, or
 36  * rejoined, as part of the SSL handshaking protocol. Sessions may be
 37  * invalidated due to policies affecting security or resource usage,
 38  * or by an application explicitly calling {@code invalidate}.
 39  * Session management policies are typically used to tune performance.
 40  *
 41  * &lt;P&gt; In addition to the standard session attributes, SSL sessions expose
 42  * these read-only attributes:  &lt;UL&gt;
 43  *
 44  *      &lt;LI&gt; &lt;em&gt;Peer Identity.&lt;/em&gt;  Sessions are between a particular
 45  *      client and a particular server.  The identity of the peer may
 46  *      have been established as part of session setup.  Peers are
 47  *      generally identified by X.509 certificate chains.
 48  *
 49  *      &lt;LI&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cipher Suite Name.&lt;/em&gt;  Cipher suites describe the
 50  *      kind of cryptographic protection that&#39;s used by connections
 51  *      in a particular session.
 52  *
 53  *      &lt;LI&gt; &lt;em&gt;Peer Host.&lt;/em&gt;  All connections in a session are
 54  *      between the same two hosts.  The address of the host on the other
 55  *      side of the connection is available.
 56  *
 57  *      &lt;/UL&gt;
 58  *
 59  * &lt;P&gt; Sessions may be explicitly invalidated.  Invalidation may also
 60  * be done implicitly, when faced with certain kinds of errors.
