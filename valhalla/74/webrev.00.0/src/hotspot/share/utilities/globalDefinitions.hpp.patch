 // TosState describes the top-of-stack state before and after the execution of
 // a bytecode or method. The top-of-stack value may be cached in one or more CPU
 // registers. The TosState corresponds to the 'machine representation' of this cached
 // value. There's 4 states corresponding to the JAVA types int, long, float & double
 // as well as a 5th state in case the top-of-stack value is actually on the top
