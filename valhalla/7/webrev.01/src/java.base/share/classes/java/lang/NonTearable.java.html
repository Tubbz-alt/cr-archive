29  * An inline class implements the {@code NonTearable} interface to
30  * request that the JVM take extra care to avoid structure tearing
31  * when loading or storing any value of the class to a field or array
32  * element.  Normally, only fields declared {@code volatile} are
33  * protected against structure tearing, but a class that implements
34  * this marker interface will never have its values torn, even when
35  * they are stored in array elements or in non-{@code volatile}
36  * fields, and even when multiple threads perform racing writes.
37  *
38  * &lt;p&gt; An inline instance of multiple components is said to be &quot;torn&quot;
39  * when two racing threads compete to write those components, and one
40  * thread writes some components while another thread writes other
41  * components, so a subsequent observer will read a hybrid composed,
42  * as if &quot;out of thin air&quot;, of field values from both racing writes.
43  * Tearing can also occur when the effects of two non-racing writes
44  * are observed by a racing read.  In general, structure tearing
45  * requires a read and two writes (initialization counting as a write)
46  * of a multi-component value, with a race between any two of the
47  * accesses.  The effect can also be described as if the Java memory
48  * model break up inline instance reads and writes into reads and
49  * writes of their various fields, as it does with longs and doubles
50  * (JLS 17.7).
51  *
52  * &lt;p&gt; In extreme cases, the hybrid observed after structure tearing
53  * might be a value which is impossible to construct by normal means.
54  * If data integrity or security depends on proper construction,
55  * the class should be declared as implementing {@code NonTearable}.
