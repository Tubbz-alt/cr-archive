 35  * Extensions to the {@code X509TrustManager} interface to support
 36  * SSL/TLS/DTLS connection sensitive trust management.
 37  * &lt;p&gt;
 38  * To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, hostname checks can be done
 39  * to verify that the hostname in an end-entity certificate matches the
 40  * targeted hostname.  TLS/DTLS does not require such checks, but some
 41  * protocols over TLS/DTLS (such as HTTPS) do.  In earlier versions of the
 42  * JDK, the certificate chain checks were done at the SSL/TLS/DTLS layer,
 43  * and the hostname verification checks were done at the layer over TLS/DTLS.
 44  * This class allows for the checking to be done during a single call to
 45  * this class.
 46  * &lt;p&gt;
 47  * RFC 2830 defines the server identification specification for the &quot;LDAPS&quot;
 48  * algorithm. RFC 2818 defines both the server identification and the
 49  * client identification specification for the &quot;HTTPS&quot; algorithm.
