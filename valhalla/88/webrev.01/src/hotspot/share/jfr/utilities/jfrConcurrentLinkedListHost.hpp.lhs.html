31 * This implementation is a derivation from Harris
32 * https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/papers/2001-caslists.pdf
33 *
34 * A concurrent LIFO structure can be built using the pair:
35 *
36 *   insert_head() and remove()
37 *
38 * The LIFO algorithm is non-blocking, more specifically wait-free.
39 * When combined with a system for safe memory reclamation, where a thread will require
40 * to know if other threads are possibly reading the memory that is to be reclaimed (more below),
41 * a potential wait point is introduced, so technically, we are no longer wait-free.
42 * The combination is still lock-free, but since it is no longer pure non-blocking,
43 * we instead say the solution is concurrent.
44 *
45 * It is also possible to build a FIFO structure using the pair:
46 *
47 *   insert_tail() and remove()
48 *
49 * To allow FIFO, the solution extends support to mark, or reserve a node, not only as part of deletions
50 * as with the LIFO case, but also, to enable tail insertions.
51 *
52 * Compared to the LIFO algorithm, the FIFO algorithm is not non-blocking, because inserts to the tail block,
53 * making it not lock-free. remove() is lock-free up until the last node in the list. In practice, the FIFO
54 * solution can be used in certain ways that very closely approximate non-blocking, for example, situations
55 * involving a single producer and multiple consumers.
56 *
57 * Although the FIFO algorithm is not non-blocking, it includes an optimization for remove() that is attractive:
58 * In the LIFO case, a slow path taken as the result of a failed excision would have to re-traverse the list
59 * to find the updated adjacent node pair for the already marked node. However, that node might already have
60 * been excised by some other thread, letting the thread potentially traverse the entire list just to discover
61 * it is no longer present (not an issue if the list is ordered by a key, then traversal is only to node &gt;= key).
62 * In the FIFO case, premised on the invariant that inserts only come in from the tail, it is possible to prove
63 * a failed cas not to be the result of a new node inserted as with the LIFO case. With FIFO, there is only a single
64 * failure mode, i.e. some other thread excised the node already. Therefore, in the FIFO case, we skip the slow-path search pass.
65 *
66 * We say that the FIFO solution is &quot;mostly&quot; concurrent, in certain situations.
