  * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/monitoring/CompilationMXBean/comptimemon001.
  * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, monitoring]
  * VM Testbase readme:
  * DESCRIPTION
  *     The test checks that
- *         CompilationMBean.isCompilationTimeMonitoringSupported()
+ *         CompilationMXBean.isCompilationTimeMonitoringSupported()
  *     method returns true. The test performs directly access to management
  *     metrics within the same JVM.
  *     Note, that the test is correct ONLY against Sun's Hotspot VM. This
  *     feature is optional and the method may return either true, or false.
  *     However, Sun's implementation must always return true.
