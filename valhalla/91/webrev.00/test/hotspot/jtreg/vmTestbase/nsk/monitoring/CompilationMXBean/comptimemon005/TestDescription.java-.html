32  * DESCRIPTION
33  *     The test checks that
34  *         CompilationMBean.isCompilationTimeMonitoringSupported()
35  *     method returns true. The test performs access to management metrics
36  *     through custom MBeanServer proxy (developed and saved in
37  *     $TESTBASE/src/nsk/monitoring/share).
38  *     Note, that the test is correct ONLY against Sun&#39;s Hotspot VM. This
39  *     feature is optional and the method may return either true, or false.
40  *     However, Sun&#39;s implementation must always return true.
41  *     The test passes, if the JVM has no compilation system, for example the
42  *     test is invoked with -Xint option.
43  * COMMENTS
44  *     Fixed the bug:
45  *     4953476 TEST_BUG: The spec is updated accoring to 4944573 and 4947536
