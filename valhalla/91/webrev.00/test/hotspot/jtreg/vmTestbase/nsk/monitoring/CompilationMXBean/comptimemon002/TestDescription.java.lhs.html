32  * DESCRIPTION
33  *     The test checks that
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified">34  *         CompilationMBean.isCompilationTimeMonitoringSupported()</span>
35  *     method returns true. The test performs access to management metrics
36  *     through default MBeanServer.
37  *     Note, that the test is correct ONLY against Sun&#39;s Hotspot VM. This
38  *     feature is optional and the method may return either true, or false.
39  *     However, Sun&#39;s implementation must always return true.
40  *     The test passes, if the JVM has no compilation system, for example the
41  *     test is invoked with -Xint option.
42  * COMMENTS
43  *     Fixed the bug:
44  *     4953476 TEST_BUG: The spec is updated accoring to 4944573 and 4947536
