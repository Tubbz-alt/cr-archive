22 ##### Summary #####
23 This test is used to check the interop compatibility on JSSE among different
24 JDK releases. The oldest version supported by the test is JDK 8. Some of Java
25 source files, like JdkInfoUtils.java, JdkProcServer.java and JdkProcClient.java,
26 use only JDK 8-compliant language features and APIs, in order to allowing
27 different JDK releases can load and run associated classes.
28 
29 ##### Usage #####
30 jtreg [-options] \
31     [-Dtest.debug=&lt;true|false&gt;] \
32     [-Dtest.jdk.list.file=&lt;/path/to/jdkListFile&gt;] \
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified">33     $JDK_WORKSPACE/test/jdk/javax/net/ssl/compatibility/Compatibility.java</span>
34 
35 Besides the common jtreg options, like -jdk, this test introduces some more
36 properties:
37 test.debug
38     It indicates if the test enable -Djavax.net.debug=all. This is a boolean
39     property, and the default value is false.
40     It is not mandatory.
41 
42 test.jdk.list.file
43     It indicate the path of a file, which lists the absolute paths of different
44     JDK builds. If no this property, the current testing JDK, specified by JTREG
45     option -jdk, is used as the testing JDK.
46     It is not mandatory.
47 
48 ##### Usage Examples #####
49 $ cat /path/to/jdkList
50 /path/to/jdk8
51 /path/to/jdk9
52 /path/to/jdk10
53 
54 $ jtreg -jdk:/path/to/latest/jdk \
55     -Ddebug=true \
56     -Dtest.jdk.list.file=/path/to/jdkList \
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">57     $JDK_WS/jdk/test/javax/net/ssl/compatibility/Compatibility.java</span>
58 The above example uses a file &quot;/path/to/jdkList&quot; to contain the paths of local
59 different JDK builds through 8 to 10. The execution uses each of JDK builds as
60 server and client respectively. And it enables SSL debug flag, and tests the
61 full parameter value set.
