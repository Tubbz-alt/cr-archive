 1 Working on JDBC Using the NetBeans IDE
 2 
 3 This JDBC NetBeans project allows a developer interested in making changes
 4 to and/or fixing bugs in the JDBC source to modify, build, run and test
 5 as well as generating the javadoc.
 6 
 7 README FIRST
 8 
 9   make/netbeans/README to get started with NetBeans IDE and OpenJDK, and
10   working with the OpenJDK NetBeans projects.

12 WORKING WITH JDBC
13 
14 JDBC doesn&#39;t contain native code. You don&#39;t need to
15 have all the Java SE sources to work on JDBC but just the following subset:
16 
17             make/netbeans/ 
18             src/share/classes/com/sun/rowset/
19             src/share/classes/java/sql/
20             src/share/classes/javax/sql/
21             test/TEST.ROOT
22             test/java/sql/
23             test/javax/sql/
24 
25 The set of actions supported by this project are:
26 
27 * Build Project:
28 
29   - Compiles JDBC source files and puts the class files under
30     build/${platform}-${arch}/classes.
31 
32   - Generates JDBC&#39;s jar file under dist/lib/jdbc.jar
33 
34     This new jar file could be used to patch an existing JDK installation
35     by using -Xbootclasspath/p:$MYSRC/dist/lib/jdbc.jar
36 
37 * Generate Javadoc for Project
38 
39   - Generates the javadoc for the JDBC source files,
40 
41   - The javadoc is generated under build/${platform}-${arch}/javadoc/jdbc.
42 
43 * Test Project
44 
45   - Runs the JDBC jtreg unit tests located under test/java/sql or test/javax/sql.
46 
47   - The test results are written under
48 
49         build/${platform}-${arch}/jtreg/jdbc
50 
51     and the HTML test report can be found at
52 
53         build/${platform}-${arch}/jtreg/jdbc/JTreport/html/report.html
54 
55 
56 
57 * Clean Project
58 
59   - Cleans the files created by this projet under build and dist.
