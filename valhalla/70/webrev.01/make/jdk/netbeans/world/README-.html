 1 Building the entire Open JDK source code
 2 
 3 This project exists solely for building the entire Open JDK source code,
 4 i.e. both the Hotspot VM and the JDK.
 5 
 6 Building this project takes considerable time and disk space.  Expect several
 7 hours and over 3GB.  Given that it takes a long time to build all of this
 8 project code, you might prefer to build it from the command line using ant.

10 Please note: the results of building this project are *not* put in the place
11 used by other projects.  In this case, the results are place in
12 
13     &lt;install-dir&gt;/build/&lt;platform&gt;-&lt;arch&gt;
14 and
15     &lt;install-dir&gt;/build/&lt;platform&gt;-&lt;arch&gt;-fastdebug
