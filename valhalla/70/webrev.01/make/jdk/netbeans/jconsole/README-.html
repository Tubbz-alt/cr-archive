 1 Working on JConsole Using the NetBeans IDE
 2 
 3 This JConsole NetBeans project allows a developer interested in making changes
 4 to and/or fixing bugs in the jconsole tool to modify, build, run and test
 5 jconsole in a standalone manner as well as generating the javadoc for the
 6 JConsole plugin API.
 7 
 8 README FIRST
 9 
10   make/netbeans/README to get started with NetBeans IDE and OpenJDK, and
11   working with the OpenJDK NetBeans projects.

13 WORKING WITH JCONSOLE
14 
15 JConsole doesn&#39;t contain native code. It&#39;s a pure java tool. You don&#39;t need to
16 have all the Java SE sources to work on JConsole but just the following subset:
17 
18             make/netbeans/ 
19             src/share/classes/com/sun/tools/jconsole/
20             src/share/classes/sun/tools/jconsole/
21             test/TEST.ROOT
22             test/sun/tools/jconsole/
23 
24 The set of actions supported by this project are:
25 
26 * Build Project:
27 
28   - Compiles JConsole&#39;s source files and puts the class files under
29     build/${platform}-${arch}/classes.
30 
31   - Generates JConsole&#39;s jar file under dist/lib/jconsole.jar
32 
33     This new jar file could be used to patch an existing JDK installation
34     by replacing the jar file at &lt;jdk-home&gt;/lib/jconsole.jar, then calling
35     &lt;jdk-home&gt;/bin/jconsole will make use of the new jar file.
36 
37 * Generate Javadoc for Project
38 
39   - Generates the javadoc for the JConsole Plugin API source files,
40     i.e. the ones under src/share/classes/com/sun/tools/jconsole.
41 
42   - The javadoc is generated under build/${platform}-${arch}/javadoc/jconsole.
43 
44 * Test Project
45 
46   - Runs the JConsole jtreg unit tests located under test/sun/tools/jconsole.
47 
48   - The test results are written under
49 
50         build/${platform}-${arch}/jtreg/jconsole
51 
52     and the HTML test report can be found at
53 
54         build/${platform}-${arch}/jtreg/jconsole/JTreport/report.html
55 
56 * Run Project
57 
58   - Runs the newly built JConsole tool.
59 
60 * Clean Project
61 
62   - Cleans the files created by this projet under build and dist.
