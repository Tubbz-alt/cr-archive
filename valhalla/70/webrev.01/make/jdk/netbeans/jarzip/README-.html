 1 Working on Jar and Zip code using the NetBeans IDE
 2 
 3 This note is specific to working on jar and zip; much more information about
 4 working with this project and others is in ../README.
 5 
 6 This project allows developers to work on the Jar and Zip in java.util.jar and
 7 java.util.zip, as well as the jar tool itself in sun.tools.jar.  The NetBeans
 8 project supports editing, building, testing, and debugging of this code.  This
 9 is a make-based project, and involves compilation of native code.  Some of
10 this native code is provided by the JDK community, but the base zip library is
11 from http://www.zlib.net.
12 
13 Please note: The most recent zlib is version 1.2.3.  We are providing zlib
14 version 1.1.3, modified to include security fixes that have been added since
15 that release.

17 Source code layout

19 The jar tool depends on the jar library, which in turn depends on the zip
20 library.  This in turn depends on some native code, which in turn depends on
21 the zlib library:
22 
23 sun.tools.jar depends on
24   java.util.jar, which depends on
25     java.util.zip, which depends on
26       src/share/native/java/util/zip, which depends on
27         src/share/native/java/util/zip/zlib-1.1.3.
28 
29 The project is set up to invoke make on the zip code first.  This make target
30 compile the native zip code, as well as the Java sources in java.util.zip.
31 Subsequent invocations of make build java.util.jar, and then sun.tools.jar.
32 
33 Insofar as NetBeans use is concerned with Java code, most things you are used
34 to.  You can build the project.  There are several regression tests included,
35 run either as a group via Test Project or individually via Run File.
36 Debugging is also supported, try Debug File.  Since the jar tool needs command
37 line parameters in order to do anything interesting, it is not hooked up to
38 Run Project in NetBeans.
