 1 Building the entire JavaSE source base
 2 
 3 This project exists for building the entire JavaSE source base which is in the
 4 jdk directory.  Rather than using this project for editing Java code, please
 5 use one of the other projects which will narrow the scope of the sources to a
 6 more manageable size.
 7 
 8 Given that it can take a rather long time to build all of the JavaSE code, you
 9 might prefer to build this project from the command line using ant.
10 
11 The results of building this project are all in the directory
12 &lt;install-dir&gt;/jdk/build/&lt;platform&gt;-&lt;arch&gt;.  The other subprojects, with the
13 exception of the &quot;world&quot; project, place their results in same build directory.
