 1 Working on Swing Using the NetBeans IDE
 2 
 3 This Swing NetBeans project allows a developer interested in making changes to
 4 and/or fixing bugs in swing to modify, build, run and test swing in a
 5 standalone manner as well as generating the javadoc for the swing classes.
 6 
 7 README FIRST
 8 
 9   make/netbeans/README to get started with NetBeans IDE and OpenJDK, and
10   working with the OpenJDK NetBeans projects.
11 
12 WORKING WITH SWING
13 
14 Swing doesn&#39;t contain native code; it&#39;s pure java. You don&#39;t need to
15 have all the Java SE sources to work on Swing but just the following subset:
16 
17             make/netbeans/ 
18             javax/swing/
19             com/sun/swing/
20             com/sun/java/swing/
21             sun/swing/
22 
23 The set of actions supported by this project are:
24 
25 * Build Project:
26 
27   - Compiles Swing&#39;s source files and puts the class files under
28     build/${platform}-${arch}/classes.
29 
30   - Generates swing.jar file under dist/lib/swing.jar
31 
32     This new jar file could be used to patch an existing JDK installation
33     by using -Xbootclasspath/p:$MYSRC/dist/lib/swing.jar
34 
35 * Generate Javadoc for Project
36 
37   - Generates the javadoc for the Swing source files,
38 
39   - The javadoc is generated under build/${platform}-${arch}/javadoc/swing.
40 
41 * Run Project
42 
43   - Builds and runs the SampleTree demo.
44 
45 * Debug Project
46 
47   - Builds and then runs the debugger on the SampleTree demo.
48 
49 * Clean Project
50 
51   - Cleans the files created by this project under build, dist, and demo.
52 
53 IMPORTANT NOTE
54 
55   Please make sure to follow carefully the governance rules documented at
56   http://openjdk.dev.java.net/

58 KNOWN ISSUES
59 
60   When debugging the project, breakpoints set in SampleTree&#39;s code will be
61   stopped at, but the editor display will not update correctly.  Breakpoints
62   outside of the constructor work as expected.
