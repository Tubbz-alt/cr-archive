  1 Working on OpenJDK using NetBeans
  2     This note describes how to work on the OpenJDK from NetBeans. We&#39;ve
  3     provided several NetBeans projects as starting points. Below we&#39;ll
  4     describe how to use them, as well as how to create your own.
  5 
  6 Getting Started
  7     In addition to the source bundle for Open JDK, you&#39;ll need to download
  8     and install copies of the JDK and of NetBeans. And if you want to run
  9     tests on the JDK (you do want to run tests, right?), you&#39;ll need to
 10     install the jtreg test harness.
 11 
 12     In this note, when pathnames are not fully specified, they should be
 13     interpreted as being relative to the directory containing this README
 14     and the NetBeans projects themselves.
 15 
 16         The JDK build process is largely make-based, and is not
 17         exceptionally tolerant of pathnames with spaces in them (such as
 18         &quot;Program Files&quot;. Please be sure to install everything in a
 19         directories whose paths don&#39;t have any spaces!
 20 
 21     Downloading the JDK
 22         You&#39;ve probably done this a million times. Download and install it
 23         from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html
 24 
 25     Downloading the OpenJDK sources
 26         Since you&#39;re reading this, d you&#39;ve already downloaded the OpenJDK
 27         source bundle.  Later in this document we&#39;ll refer to the location
 28         where you installed the Open JDK sources as *install-dir*.
 29 
 30     Downloading a pre-built, JDK 8
 31         This will be necessary to do builds of some of the projects.  In
 32         general, you want to download and install a pre-built JDK that
 33         corresponds to the OpenJDK sources you download.  Building the entire
 34         OpenJDK depends on a few parts of the pre-built JDK.  Get this from
 35         http://download.java.net/jdk8/binaries
 36 
 37         Note: For working on certain projects, like JMX and JConsole, you
 38               may find convenient to use a pre-built version of JDK 8 (or
 39               OpenJDK) rather than building your own. This will allow you
 40               to build only that part of the OpenJDK sources which correspond
 41               to that project.
 42 
 43     NetBeans 7.0 or later
 44         Older versions may also work but are unsupported.
 45 
 46     jtreg
 47         &quot;jtreg&quot; is the test harness for running OpenJDK&#39;s regression tests.
 48         Get it from http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg
 49 
 50     Ant
 51        NetBeans comes with ant, but if you use a separately-installed copy
 52        please make sure that it is at least version 1.8.1.
 53 
 54 Configuring
 55     Building OpenJDK is hard and complex. No, strike that. While it&#39;s not
 56     exactly &quot;easy&quot;, we&#39;ve got it down to *relatively* small set of
 57     properties you need to set.
 58 
 59     The NetBeans projects provided here share a fair amount of common
 60     structure. They share properties values where it makes sense. Each
 61     project loads properties from these properties files, in this order
 62 
 63         ${basedir}/nbproject/private/build.properties
 64         $HOME/.openjdk/${ant.project.name}-build.properties
 65         $HOME/.openjdk/build.properties
 66         ${basedir}/build.properties
 67 
 68     (${basedir} refers to the directory containing a particular NetBeans
 69     project.) The first time a property defined determines value: it is
 70     *not* overridden if it is read from properties files read later. The net
 71     result is that by carefully choosing where to define a property, you can
 72     have it for a specific project, all uses of a specific project (useful
 73     if you work on multiple copies of the OpenJDK sources), all projects, or
 74     only projects in a specific sandbox.
 75 
 76     With that in mind, please set the following properties. Presuming you
 77     want the same values for all your work, set them in
 78     $HOME/.openjdk/build.properties.
 79 
 80     * bootstrap.jdk
 81         Set to the location where you installed JDK 7.
 82 
 83     * jtreg.home
 84         Set to the location where you installed jtreg.
 85 
 86     * make.options
 87         Some of the projects invoke &quot;make&quot;, since they compile native code.
 88         The make.options property is for passing information about what you
 89         installed where to make.  Change the paths to fit your particular
 90         situation:
 91 
 92         make.options=\
 93             ALT_BOOTDIR=/home/me/bin/jdk1.7.0 \
 94             ALT_JDK_IMPORT_PATH=/home/me/bin/jdk1.8.0 \
 95             OPENJDK=true
 96 
 97         The trailing &#39;\&#39; are important, so that make gets the above as a
 98         single set of options.
 99 
100         You might want to add additional additional options: see the README
101         for the project you&#39;re using for more information.  And see
102                  *install-dir*/jdk/make/README-builds.html
103         to read much more about building the JDK.
104 
105   Windows-specific configuration
106     First, please note that the entire JDK cannot currently be built on
107     Windows platforms.  This will likely limit your ability to build
108     make-based projects.  See
109          *install-dir*/jdk/make/README-builds.html
110     for full information on issues with building on the Windows platform.
111 
112     That said, there are two ways to work with the Windows-required settings
113     for the Microsoft tools. Either:
114 
115     * Set environment variables values in Windows
116         Doing so means accessing the System control panel in Windows, and
117         setting the environment variables there.
118 
119         By doing so, you can launch NetBeans by double-clicking its icon,
120         and the environment variable values will be available.
121 
122     * Set environment variable values in a shell
123         Doing so means adding the settings to an init file (e.g. .bashrc,
124         .cshrc, etc.) or a file that you source before running NetBeans. In
125         this case, you&#39;ll have to launch NetBeans from the command line in a
126         shell in which you&#39;ve set the environment variables.
127 
128     In either case, the end result should be that the settings are available
129     to the make-based build process when it runs from within NetBeans.
130 
131     The make-based builds presumes that you&#39;re using cygwin, and expects to
132     find &quot;make&quot; in c:\cygwin\bin\make. If you&#39;ve installed cygwin elsewhere,
133     set &quot;make&quot; in a properties file.
134 
135   Configuring Project Properties
136     A note of caution is in order: These are NetBeans *freeform* projects.
137     If you use the NetBeans GUI to examine them, things are likely to not
138     look &quot;right&quot;. Please don&#39;t edit them there, please instead use a text
139     editor.
140 
141   Locale Requirements
142     To build the OpenJDK sources, be certain that you are using the &quot;C&quot;
143     locale on Unix (R) platforms, or &quot;English (United States)&quot; locale on
144     Windows.
145 
146 Platforms and architectures, oh my!
147     The Open JDK can be built for a variety of operating system platforms
148     and hardware architectures. The resulting builds are always placed in a
149     directory which contains the platform and architecture as part of the
150     pathname, as in *platform*-*arch*. For example, if you build the jdk
151     project on a Linux platform running on x86 hardware, the resulting build
152     will be in:
153 
154     *install-dir*/jdk/build/linux-i586
155 
156     We&#39;ve provided support for some platforms and architectures in
157     common/architectures. Add another, if your needs require it.
158 
159 Provided NetBeans projects
160     This section describes the NetBeans projects that help you work on
161     particular parts of the JDK. While they&#39;re largely similar in structure
162     and should work the way you expect NetBeans projects to work: edit,
163     build, test, etc. But there are some differences. They don&#39;t all support
164     the same targets (e.g., there&#39;s nothing to run in jarzip project).
165 
166     Some projects are built by invoking make, since they involve compilation
167     of native code or other activities that cannot be done by javac. We call
168     these &quot;make-based&quot;, and call all others &quot;ant-based&quot;.
169 
170     They all are configured by way of a build.properties file, which
171     specifies what subdirectories of the JDK sources they manipulate, what
172     directories contain their tests, whether they use make or ant, etc.
173 
174     The very first time you open any one of these projects on set of Open
175     JDK sources, NetBeans will scan the entire set of sources, not just
176     those for the project you opened. This will take a few minutes, but will
177     ensure that Go To Type, Go To Source, and so on work as expected. Later,
178     when you open other projects on the same Open JDK sources, there will be
179     at most a slight delay.
180 
181     There&#39;s a README accompanying each project. Most are text files, which
182     you can Open in NetBeans, some are HTML files, in which case unless you
183     enjoy reading raw HTML, you&#39;re better off choosing the *View* menu item
184     from the context menu, which will display the README in your web
185     browser.
186 
187     Finally, note that these projects were all created by different people,
188     and are while some attempt has been made to make them look and behave
189     the same, they are maintained separately and will vary somewhat.
190 
191     The projects currently provided are:
192 
193     jdk (directory &quot;jdk&quot;)
194         A convenient starting point for the other projects, and from which
195         you can build the entire OpenJDK. Please note that depending on your
196         hardware, this could take a *very* long time. The results of the
197         build are in *install-dir*/jdk/build/*platform*-*arch*.
198 
199     world (directory &quot;world&quot;)
200         This project builds both the Hotspot VM and all of JavaSE. Please
201         note that pretty much regardless of your hardware, this *will* take
202         a long time, and use *lots* of disk space (more than 3GB). The
203         results of the build are in
204         *install-dir*/build/*platform*-*arch* and
205         *install-dir*/build/*platform*-*arch*-fastdebug.
206 
207         Consult the project&#39;s README file for details.
208 
209     AWT &amp; Java2d (directory &quot;awt2d&quot;)
210         For working on AWT and Java2d. Supports running the Font2DTest demo.
211 
212         This is a make-based project: In order to build this project, you
213         should build the jdk project first, since AWT and Java2d include
214         native code.
215 
216     JConsole (directory &quot;jconsole&quot;)
217         For working on JConsole. Creates ../dist/lib/jconsole.jar. Supports
218         running and debugging JConsole.
219 
220         This ant-based project does *not* require that you build the jdk
221         project first, provided that you use a pre-built version of JDK 7.
222 
223     Java (TM) Management Extensions (JMX(TM)) API (directory &quot;jmx&quot;)
224         For working on JMX source code. Creates ../dist/lib/jmx.jar.
225 
226         This ant-based project does *not* require that you build the jdk
227         project first, provided that you use a pre-built version of JDK 7.
228 
229     Jar &amp; Zip (directory &quot;jarzip&quot;)
230         For working on jar &amp; zip. It builds the zip library (including
231         native code), the jar library, and the jar tool. Creates an
232         executable jar program in ../build/*platform*-*arch*/bin/jar.
233 
234         This is a make-based project: In order to build this project, you
235         should build the jdk project first, since AWT and Java2d include
236         native code.
237 
238     Swing (directory &quot;swing&quot;)
239         For working on Swing. Creates ../dist/lib/swing.jar. Supports
240         running and debugging the SampleTree demo.
241 
242         This ant-based project does *not* require that you build the jdk
243         project first, provided that you use a pre-built version of JDK 7.
244 
245     In addition, there are projects for building the compiler, javadoc,
246     and related tools, in the OpenJDK langtools component.  These
247     projects are separate from those described here, and have their
248     own set of guidelines and conventions. For more details, see the
249     README files in make/netbeans in the OpenJDK langtools component.
250 
251 Running Tests
252     We use the jtreg test harness, described more fully at
253     http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg
254 
255     The OpenJDK tests are in the default Java package, are public classes,
256     and have a &quot;static void main(String[] args)&quot; with which they are
257     invoked. Some tests are actually shell scripts, which might compile
258     code, etc. jtreg is quite flexible.
259 
260     To run tests for a project, use *Test Project* from NetBeans. From the
261     command line, you can invoke &quot;ant jtreg&quot; on any individual project&#39;s
262     build.xml file.
263 
264     In either NetBeans of on the command line, jtreg prints summary output
265     about the pass/fail nature of each test. An HTML report of the entire
266     test run is
267 
268     ../build/*platform*-*arch*/jtreg/*ant-project-name*/JTreport/report.html
269 
270     In that same JTreport directory are also individual HTML files
271     summarizing the test environment, test passes and failures, etc.
272 
273     More detail on any individual test is under
274 
275     ../build/*platform*-*arch*/jtreg/*ant-project-name*/JTwork.
276 
277     For example, details about the awt/Modal/SupportedTest/SupportedTest
278     test are under the JTwork directory at the same pathname as the test
279     itself in a &quot;.jtr&quot; file. For example:
280 
281     ../build/*platform*-*arch*/jtreg/*ant-project-name*/JTwork/awt/Modal/SupportedTest/SupportedTest.jtr
282 
283     Sometimes you will see that running jtreg has resulted in a failure.
284     This does not always mean that a test has an error in it. Jtreg
285     distinguishes between these two cases. There are a number of tests that
286     are &quot;ignored&quot;, and not run, and these are reported as failures.
287 
288     You can run a single test by right clicking on it and choosing *Run
289     File* from the context menu. Similarly, you can debug a single test by
290     choosing *Debug File*.
291 
292 Debugging
293     Debugging is enabled by default in ant-based projects, as if
294     &quot;-g:lines,vars,source&quot; were given. You can alter these settings via
295     entries in one of the configuration properties files. For example:
296 
297      javac.debug=false
298      javac.debuglevel=&lt;debug level options&gt;
299 
300     To debug a project or test, use NetBeans in the normal way, with *Debug
301     Project* or *Debug File*. Note that not all projects provide a target
302     that can be debugged, but tests can be debugged.
303 
304 Creating Javadoc
305     You can create Javadoc for any of the projects: just choose *Generate
306     Javadoc for Project* from the NetBeans menu. Your default browser will
307     open up, displaying the just-generated javadoc.
308 
309     Javadoc gets generated into a separate subdirectory for each project.
310     For example, the Jar &amp; Zip project&#39;s javadoc gets generated in
311 
312     ../build/*platform*-*arch*/jtreg/*ant-project-name*/javadoc/jarzip
313 
314 Cleaning projects
315     Each project can of course be cleaned. Make-based and ant-based projects
316     differ a little in what exactly gets cleaned. In both cases, all jtreg
317     results and javadoc are removed.
318 
319     In ant-based projects, project-specific files as determined by the
320     project&#39;s build.properties file are removed from the classes and gensrc
321     directories that are under ../build/*platform*-*arch*.
322 
323     In make-based projects, &quot;make clean&quot; is run in the same directories as
324     &quot;make all&quot; is run when building the project.
325 
326     Please note that the jdk project is &quot;special&quot; with respect to
327     cleaning: in this case, the entire ../build directory is removed.
328     Similar for the world project.
329 
330 Creating your own NetBeans project
331     The project&#39;s we&#39;ve provided are hopefully a useful starting point, but
332     chances are that you want to work on something else. This section will
333     describe how to select an existing project, and then adapt it to your
334     needs.
335 
336   Considerations
337     The first consideration is whether or not the code in which you&#39;re
338     interested needs anything beyond javac and copying of resources to
339     build. If so, then you&#39;ll need to create a make-based project. If not,
340     an ant-based project is possible. See the project descriptions above to
341     learn which are make-based, and which are ant-based.
342 
343     The second consideration is to consider the files that you&#39;ll need. Each
344     project is defined by 3 files:
345 
346     * build.xml
347         This is the ant build script. For a make-based project, they tend to
348         have a target for &quot;make clean&quot; and another for &quot;make all&quot;, each of
349         which invokes &quot;make-run&quot; in the same set of directories. Take a look
350         at jarzip/build.xml for an example.
351 
352         For an ant-based project, there might be nothing, with all the work
353         done via the declaration of properties in the build.properties file.
354         Take a look at jconsole/build.xml for an example, and notice how it
355         overrides the -pre-compile and -post-compile targets that are
356         defined in common/shared.xml (where they are defined to do nothing).
357 
358     * build.properties
359         This file defines the directories (and possibly files) that are
360         included in and excluded from. Basically, a file is considered to be
361         in a project if it is mentioned in the includes list, or is
362         contained under a directory mentioned in that list, *unless* it is
363         explicitly excluded or is contained under a directory that is
364         excluded. Take a look awt2d/build.properties for an example.
365 
366     * nbproject/project.xml
367         This file defines a project for NetBeans for a &quot;freeform&quot; project.
368         Each declares several entity references, which are used later in the
369         project. For an example, see javadoc/nbproject/project.xml, which is
370         an ant-based project. Compare that with
371         jarzip/nbproject/project.xml, which is make-based. Not much
372         difference! That&#39;s because while the jarzip project is make-based,
373         it does not have any platform-specifc native code. Contrast that
374         with awt2d/nbproject/project.xml, which does have native code;
375         notice that it uses platform-specific entity references.
376 
377     In summary, we recommend exploring the given projects, and choosing one
378     that most closely suits our needs.
379 
380   Example: A project for working on collections
381     Let&#39;s create a project to work with on the collections classes. There&#39;s no native
382     code here, so an ant-based project will do. Therefore, the jconsole
383     project is a reasonable project to use as a starting point.
384 
385    Clone the existing project
386     Make a directory for the collections project next to the existing projects:
387 
388         % mkdir -p collections/nbproject
389 
390     Copy files from the jconsole project:
391 
392         % cp jconsole/build.properties collections
393         % cp jconsole/build.xml collections
394         % cp jconsole/nbproject/project.xml collections/nbproject
395 
396    Change the set of files included in the project
397     The collections sources are all under one directory, and we want to include
398     them all. The same is true of the tests. So edit
399     collections/build.properties so that it contains these lines:
400 
401         includes=\
402             java/util/
403         excludes=\
404             java/util/Calendar.java,\
405             java/util/jar/,\
406             java/util/logging/,\
407             java/util/prefs/,\
408             java/util/regex/,\
409             java/util/spi/,\
410             java/util/zip/,\
411             **/*-XLocales.java.template
412         jtreg.tests=\
413             java/util/**/*Collection/ \
414             java/util/**/*Map/ \
415             java/util/**/*Set/ \
416             java/util/**/*List/
417 
418     Notice the trailing &quot;/&quot; in some of those pathnames: that tells NetBeans to
419     treat the path as a directory and include (or exclude) everything beneath
420     it in the hierarchy.  Note also how we include java/util, but then exclude
421     several directories under that which are not related to collections.
422 
423     The build.xml for collections is about as simple as can be. First, change the
424     name of the project:
425 
426         &lt;project name=&quot;collections&quot; default=&quot;build&quot; basedir=&quot;.&quot;&gt;
427 
428     Then remove the -pre-compile target from the build.xml.  Change the
429     -post-compile target to create collections.jar without any manifest, and
430     to only contain the collections-related classes.  The jar task now looks
431     like this:
432 
433         &lt;jar destfile=&quot;${dist.dir}/lib/collections.jar&quot;&gt;
434             &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${classes.dir}&quot;&gt;
435                 &lt;include name=&quot;java/util/*.class&quot;/&gt;
436                 &lt;exclude name=&quot;java/util/Calendar*.class&quot;/&gt;
437             &lt;/fileset&gt;
438         &lt;/jar&gt;
439 
440     Also, change the clean target to remove collections.jar instead of
441     jconsole.jar.
442 
443     Now edit project.xml file. NetBeans uses an internal name and a
444     user-visible name, both of which should be changed:
445 
446         &lt;name&gt;Collections&lt;/name&gt; &lt;!-- Customized --&gt;
447 
448         &lt;property name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;collections&lt;/property&gt; &lt;!-- Customized --&gt;
449 
450     Inside of &lt;ide-actions&gt;, you&#39;ll see actions defined for &quot;run&quot; and
451     &quot;debug&quot;. The Open JDK sources don&#39;t include any interesting Collections
452     demos, but leave these here for now: Chances are you&#39;ll find or create
453     some collections app of your own, and want to run and or debug it.
454 
455     Now, open the Collections project in NetBeans. You&#39;ll find that it operates
456     just like all the other projects.
457 
458     If/when you want to have this project run a collections demo, change the run
459     target in collections/build.xml to invoke it in whatever manner is appropriate
460     for the app. From NetBeans, you should be able to run and debug the app,
461     including setting breakpoints in collections code.
462 
463 Appendix 1: Customizations
464     There are several ways to customize NetBeans projects. These projects
465     share a common structure, based on common/shared.xml and
466     common/make.xml. Because of that sharing, some mechanisms described
467     below apply to most any project.
468 
469     Several properties can be user-defined (and several should not be
470     user-defined!). There are different properties files read. Some default
471     targets can be overridden.
472 
473   Property files
474     When projects are started, and when when ant runs (whether from NetBeans
475     or the command line), these properties files are loaded in the order
476     shown:
477 
478         ${basedir}/nbproject/private/build.properties
479         $HOME/.openjdk/${ant.project.name}-build.properties
480         $HOME/.openjdk/build.properties
481         ${basedir}/build.properties
482 
483     Recall that with ant, once a property is defined, its value cannot be
484     changed, so it&#39;s &quot;first one wins&quot;.
485 
486     To set or change a property for all your projects, put the change into
487     $HOME/.openjdk/build.properties. This will affect all projects,
488     regardless of how many copies of the Open JDK sources you have
489     installed.
490 
491     Let&#39;s say you have 2 copies of the Open JDK sources installed on your
492     machine. To set or change a property for only the jconsole projects, but
493     for both of them, make the change in
494     $HOME/.openjdk/${ant.project.name}-build.properties. If you wanted to
495     make the change for only one of them, do it in that project&#39;s
496     ${basedir}/build.properties or
497     ${basedir}/nbproject/private/build.properties.
498 
499     Note that the ${basedir}/build.properties file is provided as part of
500     the Open JDK sources. If you want to make a change for a particular
501     project, you can do so there. To be sure that you don&#39;t ever
502     accidentally check it in to the Open JDK sources, you might prefer to
503     change it in ${basedir}/nbproject/private/build.properties.
504 
505   User-definable Properties
506     You can provide your own definitions for the properties listed below. We
507     don&#39;t recommend overriding the definitions of other properties.
508 
509     The following two properties should be set before you try to use the
510     projects with NetBeans or ant:
511 
512     * bootstrap.jdk
513         Default: None. Please set this, normally in
514         $HOME/.openjdk/build.properties.
515 
516     * jtreg.home
517         Default: None. Please set this, normally in
518         $HOME/.openjdk/build.properties.
519 
520     These options are for configuring the behavior of make:
521 
522     * use.make
523         Default: Not set. Set this, normally in ${basedir}/build.properties,
524         for a project which is make-based.
525 
526     * make
527         Default: The right make for the platform, at the normal location, set
528         in *install-dir*/jdk/make/netbeans/common/make.xml
529 
530     * make.options
531         Default: Empty string. Set this to any options you want to pass to
532         make, normally in ${basedir}/build.properties.
533 
534     The remaining options are for use at your discretion:
535 
536     * javac.options
537         Default: -Xlint
538 
539     * javac.debug
540         Default: true
541 
542     * javac.debuglevel
543         Default: lines,vars,source
544 
545     * javadoc.options
546         Default: Empty string.  Some projects will need to set this to
547         increase the heap for running javadoc.  For example, see the jconsole
548         project.
549 
550     * javadoc.packagenames
551         Default: &quot;none&quot;.  Set this only if your project has packages that
552         should be javadoc&#39;d which are outside of those listed in the javadoc
553         target&#39;s packageset.  See the jconsole project for an example.
554 
555     * jtreg.tests
556         Default: None. Set this to a list of tests and/or directories
557         containing regression tests, normally in
558         ${basedir}/build.properties.
559 
560     * jtreg.options
561         Default: Empty string. See http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg
562 
563     * jtreg.vm.options
564         Default: Empty string. See http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg
565 
566     * jtreg.samevm
567         Default: false. See http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg
568 
569   User-overridable Targets
570     The following targets are provided for your convenience in customizing
571     various standard actions of the build process. The default action for
572     each one is to do nothing.
573 
574     These come in pairs, allowing your scripts to take some action before or
575     after a standard action.
576 
577     * -pre-init
578         Runs before any other initialization has been done.
579 
580     * -post-init
581         Runs before after all other initialization has been done.
582 
583     * -pre-compile
584         Runs before compilation, whether via ant or make. Note that in the
585         case of make, it is before the -build-make target has run, not after
586         each individual make-run has run.
587 
588     * -post-compile
589         Runs after compilation, whether via ant or make.
590 
591     * -pre-jtreg
592         Runs before regression tests are run.
593 
594     * -post-jtreg
595         Runs before after regression tests are run.
596 
597     In a make-based project, you should override these targets to do the
598     build and clean actions required of your project.
599 
600     * -build-make
601     * -clean-make
602 
603 Known Issues
604 
605   Can&#39;t run nor debug a single test in the JConsole test
606     In most projects, you can run a single test by opening it in the editor,
607     and choosing Run File from the context menu.  If you try this with the a
608     JConsole test, instead you&#39;ll see that *all* tests from *all* projects
609     are run.  The workaround is to not try to run a single JConsole test.
610     Debugging is similarly problematic (both running and debugging use the
611     same underlying infrastructure).
612 
613     If you do Run File a JConsole tests, you can always stop them by pressing
614     the stop button in the NetBeans output window.  But you&#39;ll be surprised to
615     learn that they are actually still running in the background.  The only
616     way out of this situation is to exit NetBeans.  A few more tests will run,
617     but after restarting NetBeans things will be OK.
