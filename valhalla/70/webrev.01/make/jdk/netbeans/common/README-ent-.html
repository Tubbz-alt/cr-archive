 1 The *.ent files in this directory provide common functionality to the
 2 project.xml file of various projects.  There are different kinds,
 3 e.g. &quot;-sources&quot; from share-sources.ent
 4 
 5 * -sources: Defines sources used by a project.
 6 
 7 * -view: Defines project&#39;s sources that are displayed in the Projects tab.
 8 
 9 * -actions: Defines a set of actions of the project available from NetBeans.
10 
11 * -bindings: Defines the targets invoked by the corresponding actions.
12 
13 Note that -sources and -view files come in pairs: A project will have an
14 entity reference for each, so that it uses and displays the sources.
15 
16 Similarly, -actions and -bindings are paired.
17 
18 These kinds are not paired:
19 
20 build-folder.ent: Defines the location of the folder where compiled classes,
21 resources, etc. are placed.
22 
23 java-data-native.ent, java-data-no-native.ent: These define information about
24 the location of classes and sources of native and non-native projects, where
25 &quot;native&quot; is suggestive of &quot;native code&quot;, that is, non-Java source code.
