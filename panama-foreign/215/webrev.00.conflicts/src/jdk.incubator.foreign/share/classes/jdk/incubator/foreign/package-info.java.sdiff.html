 34  * hierarchy enables description of &lt;em&gt;memory layouts&lt;/em&gt; and basic operations such as computing the size in bytes of a given
 35  * layout, obtain its alignment requirements, and so on. Memory layouts also provide an alternate, more abstract way, to produce
 36  * memory access var handles, e.g. using &lt;a href=&quot;MemoryLayout.html#layout-paths&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;layout paths&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
 37  *
 38  * For example, to allocate an off-heap memory region big enough to hold 10 values of the primitive type {@code int}, and fill it with values
 39  * ranging from {@code 0} to {@code 9}, we can use the following code:
 40  *
 41  * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 42 static final VarHandle intHandle = MemoryHandles.varHandle(int.class, ByteOrder.nativeOrder());
 43 
 44 try (MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(10 * 4)) {
 45     MemoryAddress base = segment.baseAddress();
 46     for (long i = 0 ; i &lt; 10 ; i++) {
 47        intHandle.set(base.addOffset(i * 4), (int)i);
 48     }
 49 }
 50  * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 51  *
 52  * Here we create a var handle, namely {@code intHandle}, to manipulate values of the primitive type {@code int}, at
 53  * a given memory location. Also, {@code intHandle} is stored in a {@code static} and {@code final} field, to achieve

 54  * better performance and allow for inlining of the memory access operation through the {@link java.lang.invoke.VarHandle}



 55  * instance. We then create a &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; memory segment, that is, a memory segment backed by
 56  * off-heap memory; the size of the segment is 40 bytes, enough to store 10 values of the primitive type {@code int}.
 57  * The segment is created inside a &lt;em&gt;try-with-resources&lt;/em&gt; construct: this idiom ensures that all the memory resources
 58  * associated with the segment will be released at the end of the block, according to the semantics described in
 59  * Section {@jls 14.20.3} of &lt;cite&gt;The Java&amp;trade; Language Specification&lt;/cite&gt;. Inside the try-with-resources block, we initialize
 60  * the contents of the memory segment; more specifically, if we view the memory segment as a set of 10 adjacent slots,
 61  * {@code s[i]}, where {@code 0 &lt;= i &lt; 10}, where the size of each slot is exactly 4 bytes, the initialization logic above will set each slot
 62  * so that {@code s[i] = i}, again where {@code 0 &lt;= i &lt; 10}.
 63  *
 64  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;deallocation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Deterministic deallocation&lt;/h2&gt;
 65  *
 66  * When writing code that manipulates memory segments, especially if backed by memory which resides outside the Java heap, it is
 67  * crucial that the resources associated with a memory segment are released when the segment is no longer in use, by calling the {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemorySegment#close()}
 68  * method either explicitly, or implicitly, by relying on try-with-resources construct (as demonstrated in the example above).
 69  * Closing a given memory segment is an &lt;em&gt;atomic&lt;/em&gt; operation which can either succeed - and result in the underlying
 70  * memory associated with the segment to be released, or &lt;em&gt;fail&lt;/em&gt; with an exception.
 71  * &lt;p&gt;
 72  * The deterministic deallocation model differs significantly from the implicit strategies adopted within other APIs, most
 73  * notably the {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer} API: in that case, when a native byte buffer is created (see {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer#allocateDirect(int)}),
 74  * the underlying memory is not released until the byte buffer reference becomes &lt;em&gt;unreachable&lt;/em&gt;. While implicit deallocation
