28  * &lt;p&gt; Classes to support low-level, safe and efficient memory access.
29  * &lt;p&gt;
30  * The key abstractions introduced by this package are {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemorySegment} and {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemoryAddress}.
31  * The first models a contiguous memory region, which can reside either inside or outside the Java heap; the latter models an address - which can
32  * sometimes be expressed as an offset into a given segment. A memory address represents the main access coordinate of a memory access var handle, which can be obtained
33  * using the combinator methods defined in the {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemoryHandles} class. Finally, the {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemoryLayout} class
34  * hierarchy enables description of &lt;em&gt;memory layouts&lt;/em&gt; and basic operations such as computing the size in bytes of a given
35  * layout, obtain its alignment requirements, and so on. Memory layouts also provide an alternate, more abstract way, to produce
36  * memory access var handles, e.g. using &lt;a href=&quot;MemoryLayout.html#layout-paths&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;layout paths&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
37  *
38  * For example, to allocate an off-heap memory region big enough to hold 10 values of the primitive type {@code int}, and fill it with values
39  * ranging from {@code 0} to {@code 9}, we can use the following code:
40  *
41  * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
42 static final VarHandle intHandle = MemoryHandles.varHandle(int.class, ByteOrder.nativeOrder());
43 
44 try (MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(10 * 4)) {
45     MemoryAddress base = segment.baseAddress();
46     for (long i = 0 ; i &lt; 10 ; i++) {
47        intHandle.set(base.addOffset(i * 4), (int)i);
48     }
49 }
50  * }&lt;/pre&gt;
51  *
52  * Here we create a var handle, namely {@code intHandle}, to manipulate values of the primitive type {@code int}, at
53  * a given memory location. Also, {@code intHandle} is stored in a {@code static} and {@code final} field, to achieve
54  * better performance and allow for inlining of the memory access operation through the {@link java.lang.invoke.VarHandle}
55  * instance. We then create a &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; memory segment, that is, a memory segment backed by
56  * off-heap memory; the size of the segment is 40 bytes, enough to store 10 values of the primitive type {@code int}.
57  * The segment is created inside a &lt;em&gt;try-with-resources&lt;/em&gt; construct: this idiom ensures that all the memory resources
58  * associated with the segment will be released at the end of the block, according to the semantics described in
59  * Section {@jls 14.20.3} of &lt;cite&gt;The Java&amp;trade; Language Specification&lt;/cite&gt;. Inside the try-with-resources block, we initialize
60  * the contents of the memory segment; more specifically, if we view the memory segment as a set of 10 adjacent slots,
61  * {@code s[i]}, where {@code 0 &lt;= i &lt; 10}, where the size of each slot is exactly 4 bytes, the initialization logic above will set each slot
62  * so that {@code s[i] = i}, again where {@code 0 &lt;= i &lt; 10}.
63  *
64  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;deallocation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Deterministic deallocation&lt;/h2&gt;
65  *
66  * When writing code that manipulates memory segments, especially if backed by memory which resides outside the Java heap, it is
67  * crucial that the resources associated with a memory segment are released when the segment is no longer in use, by calling the {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemorySegment#close()}
68  * method either explicitly, or implicitly, by relying on try-with-resources construct (as demonstrated in the example above).
69  * Closing a given memory segment is an &lt;em&gt;atomic&lt;/em&gt; operation which can either succeed - and result in the underlying
70  * memory associated with the segment to be released, or &lt;em&gt;fail&lt;/em&gt; with an exception.
71  * &lt;p&gt;
72  * The deterministic deallocation model differs significantly from the implicit strategies adopted within other APIs, most
73  * notably the {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer} API: in that case, when a native byte buffer is created (see {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer#allocateDirect(int)}),
74  * the underlying memory is not released until the byte buffer reference becomes &lt;em&gt;unreachable&lt;/em&gt;. While implicit deallocation
75  * models such as this can be very convenient - clients do not have to remember to &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; a direct buffer - such models can also make it
76  * hard for clients to ensure that the memory associated with a direct buffer has indeed been released.
77  *
78  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;safety&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Safety&lt;/h2&gt;
79  *
80  * This API provides strong safety guarantees when it comes to memory access. First, when dereferencing a memory segment using
81  * a memory address, such an address is validated (upon access), to make sure that it does not point to a memory location
82  * which resides &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment it refers to. We call this guarantee &lt;em&gt;spatial safety&lt;/em&gt;;
83  * in other words, access to memory segments is bounds-checked, in the same way as array access is, as described in
84  * Section {@jls 15.10.4} of &lt;cite&gt;The Java&amp;trade; Language Specification&lt;/cite&gt;.
85  * &lt;p&gt;
86  * Since memory segments can be closed (see above), a memory address is also validated (upon access) to make sure that
87  * the segment it belongs to has not been closed prematurely. We call this guarantee &lt;em&gt;temporal safety&lt;/em&gt;. Note that,
88  * in the general case, guaranteeing temporal safety can be hard, as multiple threads could attempt to access and/or close
89  * the same memory segment concurrently. The memory access API addresses this problem by imposing strong
90  * &lt;a href=&quot;MemorySegment.html#thread-confinement&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;thread-confinement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; guarantees on memory segments: each
91  * memory segment is associated with an owner thread, which is the only thread that can either access or close the segment.
92  * &lt;p&gt;
93  * Together, spatial and temporal safety ensure that each memory access operation either succeeds - and accesses a valid
94  * memory location - or fails.
