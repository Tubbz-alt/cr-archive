  1 This document describes system properties that are used for internal
  2 debugging and instrumentation purposes, along with the system loggers,
  3 which are used for the same thing.
  4 
  5 This document is intended as a developer resource, and it is not
  6 needed as Nashorn documentation for normal usage. Flags and system
  7 properties described herein are subject to change without notice.
  8 
  9 =====================================
 10 1. System properties used internally
 11 =====================================
 12 
 13 This documentation of the system property flags assume that the
 14 default value of the flag is false, unless otherwise specified.
 15 
 16 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.args=&lt;string&gt;
 17 
 18 This property takes as its value a space separated list of Nashorn
 19 command line options that should be passed to Nashorn. This might be
 20 useful in environments where it is hard to tell how a nashorn.jar is
 21 launched.
 22 
 23 Example:
 24 
 25 &gt; java -Dnashorn.args=&quot;--lazy-complation --log=compiler&quot; large-java-app-with-nashorn.jar 
 26 &gt; ant -Dnashorn.args=&quot;--log=codegen&quot; antjob
 27 
 28 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.args.prepend=&lt;string&gt;
 29 
 30 This property behaves like nashorn.args, but adds the given arguments
 31 before the existing ones instead of after them. Later arguments will
 32 overwrite earlier ones, so this is useful for setting default arguments
 33 that can be overwritten.
 34 
 35 
 36 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.unstable.relink.threshold=x
 37 
 38 NOTE: This property is deprecated in favor of the 
 39 &quot;--unstable-relink-threshold&quot; command line option. It controls how many
 40 call site misses are allowed before a callsite is relinked with &quot;apply&quot;
 41 semantics to never change again. In the case of megamorphic callsites, 
 42 this is necessary, or the program would spend all its time swapping out 
 43 callsite targets. When neither the system property nor the command line
 44 option are specified, defaults to 8, or 16 with optimistic types turned
 45 on.
 46 
 47 
 48 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.compiler.splitter.threshold=x
 49 
 50 This will change the node weight that requires a subgraph of the IR to
 51 be split into several classes in order not to run out of bytecode space.
 52 The default value is 0x8000 (32768).
 53 
 54 
 55 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.serialize.compression=&lt;x&gt;
 56 
 57 This property sets the compression level used when deflating serialized
 58 AST structures of anonymous split functions. Valid values range from 0 to 9,
 59 the default value is 4. Higher values will reduce memory size of serialized
 60 AST but increase CPU usage required for compression.
 61 
 62 
 63 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.codegen.debug.trace=&lt;x&gt;
 64 
 65 See the description of the codegen logger below.
 66 
 67 
 68 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.fields.objects, -Dnashorn.fields.dual
 69 
 70 When the nashorn.fields.objects property is true, Nashorn will always
 71 use object fields for AccessorProperties, requiring boxing for all
 72 primitive property values. When nashorn.fields.dual is set, Nashorn
 73 will always use dual long/object fields, which allows primitives to be
 74 stored without boxing. When neither system property is set, Nashorn
 75 chooses a setting depending on the optimistic types setting (dual
 76 fields when optimistic types are enabled, object-only fields otherwise).
 77 
 78 With dual fields, Nashorn uses long fields to store primitive values.
 79 Ints are represented as the 32 low bits of the long fields. Doubles
 80 are represented as the doubleToLongBits of their value. This way a
 81 single field can be used for all primitive types. Packing and
 82 unpacking doubles to their bit representation is intrinsified by
 83 the JVM and extremely fast.
 84 
 85 In the future, this might complement or be replaced by experimental
 86 feature sun.misc.TaggedArray, which has been discussed on the mlvm
 87 mailing list. TaggedArrays are basically a way to share data space
 88 between primitives and references, and have the GC understand this.
 89 
 90 
 91 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.compiler.symbol.trace=[&lt;x&gt;[,*]], 
 92   -Dnashorn.compiler.symbol.stacktrace=[&lt;x&gt;[,*]]
 93 
 94 When this property is set, creation and manipulation of any symbol
 95 named &quot;x&quot; will show information about when the compiler changes its
 96 type assumption, bytecode local variable slot assignment and other
 97 data. This is useful if, for example, a symbol shows up as an Object,
 98 when you believe it should be a primitive. Usually there is an
 99 explanation for this, for example that it exists in the global scope
100 and type analysis has to be more conservative. 
101 
102 Several symbols names to watch can be specified by comma separation.
103 
104 If no variable name is specified (and no equals sign), all symbols
105 will be watched
106 
107 By using &quot;stacktrace&quot; instead of or together with &quot;trace&quot;, stack
108 traces will be displayed upon symbol changes according to the same
109 semantics.
110 
111 
112 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.lexer.xmlliterals
113 
114 If this property it set, it means that the Lexer should attempt to
115 parse XML literals, which would otherwise generate syntax
116 errors. Warning: there are currently no unit tests for this
117 functionality.
118 
119 XML literals, when this is enabled, end up as standard LiteralNodes in
120 the IR.
121 
122 
123 SYSTEM_PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.debug
124 
125 If this property is set to true, Nashorn runs in Debug mode. Debug
126 mode is slightly slower, as for example statistics counters are enabled
127 during the run. Debug mode makes available a NativeDebug instance
128 called &quot;Debug&quot; in the global space that can be used to print property
129 maps and layout for script objects, as well as a &quot;dumpCounters&quot; method
130 that will print the current values of the previously mentioned stats
131 counters.
132 
133 These functions currently exists for Debug:
134 
135 &quot;map&quot; - print(Debug.map(x)) will dump the PropertyMap for object x to
136 stdout (currently there also exist functions called &quot;embedX&quot;, where X
137 is a value from 0 to 3, that will dump the contents of the embed pool
138 for the first spill properties in any script object and &quot;spill&quot;, that
139 will dump the contents of the growing spill pool of spill properties
140 in any script object. This is of course subject to change without
141 notice, should we change the script object layout.
142 
143 &quot;methodHandle&quot; - this method returns the method handle that is used
144 for invoking a particular script function.
145 
146 &quot;identical&quot; - this method compares two script objects for reference
147 equality. It is a == Java comparison
148 
149 &quot;equals&quot; - Returns true if two objects are either referentially
150 identical or equal as defined by java.lang.Object.equals.
151 
152 &quot;dumpCounters&quot; - will dump the debug counters&#39; current values to
153 stdout.
154 
155 Currently we count number of ScriptObjects in the system, number of
156 Scope objects in the system, number of ScriptObject listeners added,
157 removed and dead (without references).
158 
159 We also count number of ScriptFunctions, ScriptFunction invocations
160 and ScriptFunction allocations.
161 
162 Furthermore we count PropertyMap statistics: how many property maps
163 exist, how many times were property maps cloned, how many times did
164 the property map history cache hit, prevent new allocations, how many
165 prototype invalidations were done, how many time the property map
166 proto cache hit.
167 
168 Finally we count callsite misses on a per callsite bases, which occur
169 when a callsite has to be relinked, due to a previous assumption of
170 object layout being invalidated.
171 
172 &quot;getContext&quot; - return the current Nashorn context.
173 
174 &quot;equalWithoutType&quot; - Returns true if if the two objects are both
175 property maps, and they have identical properties in the same order,
176 but allows the properties to differ in their types.
177 
178 &quot;diffPropertyMaps&quot; Returns a diagnostic string representing the difference
179 of two property maps.
180 
181 &quot;getClass&quot; - Returns the Java class of an object, or undefined if null.
182 
183 &quot;toJavaString&quot; - Returns the Java toString representation of an object.
184 
185 &quot;toIdentString&quot; - Returns a string representation of an object consisting
186 of its java class name and hash code.
187 
188 &quot;getListenerCount&quot; - Return the number of property listeners for a
189 script object.
190 
191 &quot;getEventQueueCapacity&quot; - Get the capacity of the event queue.
192 
193 &quot;setEventQueueCapacity&quot; - Set the event queue capacity.
194 
195 &quot;addRuntimeEvent&quot; - Add a runtime event to the runtime event queue.
196 The queue has a fixed size (see -Dnashorn.runtime.event.queue.size)
197 and the oldest entry will be thrown out of the queue is about to overflow.
198 
199 &quot;expandEventQueueCapacity&quot; - Expands the event queue capacity,
200 or truncates if capacity is lower than current capacity. Then only
201 the newest entries are kept.
202 
203 &quot;clearRuntimeEvents&quot; - Clear the runtime event queue.
204 
205 &quot;removeRuntimeEvent&quot; - Remove a specific runtime event from the event queue.
206 
207 &quot;getRuntimeEvents&quot; - Return all runtime events in the queue as an array.
208 
209 &quot;getLastRuntimeEvent&quot; - Return the last runtime event in the queue.
210 
211 
212 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.methodhandles.debug.stacktrace
213 
214 This enhances methodhandles logging (see below) to also dump the
215 stack trace for every instrumented method handle operation.
216 Warning: This is enormously verbose, but provides a pretty
217 decent &quot;grep:able&quot; picture of where the calls are coming from.
218 
219 
220 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.cce
221 
222 Setting this system property causes the Nashorn linker to rely on
223 ClassCastExceptions for triggering a callsite relink. If not set, the linker
224 will add an explicit instanceof guard.
225 
226 
227 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.spill.threshold=&lt;x&gt;
228 
229 This property sets the number of fields in an object from which to use
230 generic array based spill storage instead of Java fields. The default value
231 is 256.
232 
233 
234 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.tcs.miss.samplePercent=&lt;x&gt;
235 
236 When running with the trace callsite option (-tcs), Nashorn will count
237 and instrument any callsite misses that require relinking. As the
238 number of relinks is large and usually produces a lot of output, this
239 system property can be used to constrain the percentage of misses that
240 should be logged. Typically this is set to 1 or 5 (percent). 1% is the
241 default value.
242 
243 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.persistent.code.cache
244 
245 This property can be used to set the directory where Nashorn stores
246 serialized script classes generated with the -pcc/--persistent-code-cache
247 option. The default directory name is &quot;nashorn_code_cache&quot;.
248 
249 
250 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.typeInfo.maxFiles
251 
252 Maximum number of files to store in the type info cache. The type info cache
253 is used to cache type data of JavaScript functions when running with
254 optimistic types (-ot/--optimistic-types). There is one file per JavaScript
255 function in the cache.
256 
257 The default value is 0 which means the feature is disabled. Setting this
258 to something like 20000 is probably good enough for most applications and
259 will usually cap the cache directory to about 80MB presuming a 4kB
260 filesystem allocation unit. Set this to &quot;unlimited&quot; to run without limit.
261 
262 If the value is not 0 or &quot;unlimited&quot;, Nashorn will spawn a cleanup thread
263 that makes sure the number of files in the cache does not exceed the given
264 value by deleting the least recently modified files.
265 
266 
267 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.typeInfo.cacheDir
268 
269 This property can be used to set the directory where Nashorn stores the
270 type info cache when -Dnashorn.typeInfo.maxFiles is set to a nonzero
271 value. The default location is platform specific. On Windows, it is
272 &quot;${java.io.tmpdir}\com.oracle.java.NashornTypeInfo&quot;. On Linux and
273 Solaris it is &quot;~/.cache/com.oracle.java.NashornTypeInfo&quot;. On Mac OS X,
274 it is &quot;~/Library/Caches/com.oracle.java.NashornTypeInfo&quot;.
275 
276 
277 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.typeInfo.cleanupDelaySeconds=&lt;value&gt;
278 
279 This sets the delay between cleanups of the typeInfo cache, in seconds.
280 The default delay is 20 seconds.
281 
282 
283 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.profilefile=&lt;filename&gt;
284 
285 When running with the profile callsite options (-pcs), Nashorn will
286 dump profiling data for all callsites to stderr as a shutdown hook. To
287 instead redirect this to a file, specify the path to the file using
288 this system property.
289 
290 
291 SYSTEM_PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.regexp.impl=[jdk|joni]
292 
293 This property defines the regular expression engine to be used by
294 Nashorn. Set this flag to &quot;jdk&quot; to get an implementation based on the
295 JDK&#39;s java.util.regex package. Set this property to &quot;joni&quot; to install
296 an implementation based on Joni, the regular expression engine used by
297 the JRuby project. The default value for this flag is &quot;joni&quot;
298 
299 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.runtime.event.queue.size=&lt;value&gt;
300 
301 Nashorn provides a fixed sized runtime event queue for debugging purposes.
302 See -Dnashorn.debug for methods to access the event queue.
303 The default value is 1024.
304 
305 SYSTEM PROPERTY: -Dnashorn.anonymous.classes.threshold=&lt;value&gt;
306 
307 Nashorn can use anonymous classes for loading compiled scripts, depending
308 on the --anonymous-classes=[auto|true|false] option. Anonymous classes load
309 faster, but the loaded classes get less optimization applied to them and
310 therefore usually run slower. In the default &quot;auto&quot; setting, scripts are
311 loaded as anonymous classes if the script size does not exceed 512 bytes.
312 The above system property allows to set this threshold to a user defined
313 value.
314 
315 ===============
316 2. The loggers.
317 ===============
318 
319 It is very simple to create your own logger. Use the DebugLogger class
320 and give the subsystem name as a constructor argument.
321 
322 The Nashorn loggers can be used to print per-module or per-subsystem
323 debug information with different levels of verbosity. The loggers for
324 a given subsystem are available are enabled by using
325 
326 --log=&lt;systemname&gt;[:&lt;level&gt;]
327 
328 on the command line.
329 
330 Here &lt;systemname&gt; identifies the name of the subsystem to be logged
331 and the optional colon and level argument is a standard
332 java.util.logging.Level name (severe, warning, info, config, fine,
333 finer, finest). If the level is left out for a particular subsystem,
334 it defaults to &quot;info&quot;. Any log message logged as the level or a level
335 that is more important will be output to stderr by the logger.
336 
337 Several loggers can be enabled by a single command line option, by
338 putting a comma after each subsystem/level tuple (or each subsystem if
339 level is unspecified). The --log option can also be given multiple
340 times on the same command line, with the same effect.
341 
342 For example: --log=codegen,fields:finest is equivalent to
343 --log=codegen:info --log=fields:finest
344 
345 The following is an incomplete list of subsystems that currently
346 support logging. Look for classes implementing
347 jdk.nashorn.internal.runtime.logging.Loggable for more loggers.
348 
349 
350 * compiler
351 
352 The compiler is in charge of turning source code and function nodes
353 into byte code, and installs the classes into a class loader
354 controlled from the Context. Log messages are, for example, about
355 things like new compile units being allocated. The compiler has global
356 settings that all the tiers of codegen (e.g. Lower and CodeGenerator)
357 use.s
358 
359 
360 * recompile
361 
362 This logger shows information about recompilation of scripts and
363 functions at runtime. Recompilation may happen because a function
364 was called with different parameter types, or because an optimistic
365 assumption failed while executing a function with -ot/--optimistic-types.
366 
367 
368 * codegen
369 
370 The code generator is the emitter stage of the code pipeline, and
371 turns the lowest tier of a FunctionNode into bytecode. Codegen logging
372 shows byte codes as they are being emitted, line number information
373 and jumps. It also shows the contents of the bytecode stack prior to
374 each instruction being emitted. This is a good debugging aid. For
375 example:
376 
377 [codegen] #41                       line:2 (f)_afc824e 
378 [codegen] #42                           load symbol x slot=2 
379 [codegen] #43  {1:O}                    load int 0 
380 [codegen] #44  {2:I O}                  dynamic_runtime_call GT:ZOI_I args=2 returnType=boolean 
381 [codegen] #45                              signature (Ljava/lang/Object;I)Z 
382 [codegen] #46  {1:Z}                    ifeq  ternary_false_5402fe28 
383 [codegen] #47                           load symbol x slot=2 
384 [codegen] #48  {1:O}                    goto ternary_exit_107c1f2f 
385 [codegen] #49                       ternary_false_5402fe28 
386 [codegen] #50                           load symbol x slot=2 
387 [codegen] #51  {1:O}                    convert object -&gt; double 
388 [codegen] #52  {1:D}                    neg 
389 [codegen] #53  {1:D}                    convert double -&gt; object 
390 [codegen] #54  {1:O}                ternary_exit_107c1f2f 
391 [codegen] #55  {1:O}                    return object 
392 
393 shows a ternary node being generated for the sequence &quot;return x &gt; 0 ?
394 x : -x&quot;
395 
396 The first number on the log line is a unique monotonically increasing
397 emission id per bytecode. There is no guarantee this is the same id
398 between runs.  depending on non deterministic code
399 execution/compilation, but for small applications it usually is. If
400 the system variable -Dnashorn.codegen.debug.trace=&lt;x&gt; is set, where x
401 is a bytecode emission id, a stack trace will be shown as the
402 particular bytecode is about to be emitted. This can be a quick way to
403 determine where it comes from without attaching the debugger. &quot;Who
404 generated that neg?&quot;
405 
406 The --log=codegen option is equivalent to setting the system variable
407 &quot;nashorn.codegen.debug&quot; to true.
408 
409 * fold
410 
411 Shows constant folding taking place before lowering
412 
413 * lower
414 
415 This is the first lowering pass.
416 
417 Lower is a code generation pass that turns high level IR nodes into
418 lower level one, for example substituting comparisons to RuntimeNodes
419 and inlining finally blocks.
420 
421 Lower is also responsible for determining control flow information
422 like end points.
423 
424 * symbols
425 
426 The symbols logger tracks the assignment os symbols to identifiers.
427 
428 * scopedepths
429 
430 This logs the calculation of scope depths for non-local symbols.
431 
432 * fields
433 
434 The --log=fields option (at info level) is equivalent to setting the
435 system variable &quot;nashorn.fields.debug&quot; to true. At the info level it
436 will only show info about type assumptions that were invalidated. If
437 the level is set to finest, it will also trace every AccessorProperty
438 getter and setter in the program, show arguments, return values
439 etc. It will also show the internal representation of respective field
440 (Object in the normal case, unless running with the dual field
441 representation)
442 
443 * time
444 
445 This enables timers for various phases of script compilation. The timers
446 will be dumped when the Nashorn process exits. We see a percentage value
447 of how much time was spent not executing bytecode (i.e. compilation and
448 internal tasks) at the end of the report. 
449 
450 A finer level than &quot;info&quot; will show individual compilation timings as they
451 happen.
452 
453 Here is an example:
454 
455 [time] Accumulated complation phase Timings:
456 [time] 
457 [time] &#39;JavaScript Parsing&#39;              1076 ms
458 [time] &#39;Constant Folding&#39;                 159 ms
459 [time] &#39;Control Flow Lowering&#39;            303 ms
460 [time] &#39;Program Point Calculation&#39;        282 ms
461 [time] &#39;Builtin Replacement&#39;               71 ms
462 [time] &#39;Code Splitting&#39;                   670 ms
463 [time] &#39;Symbol Assignment&#39;                474 ms
464 [time] &#39;Scope Depth Computation&#39;          249 ms
465 [time] &#39;Optimistic Type Assignment&#39;       186 ms
466 [time] &#39;Local Variable Type Calculation&#39;  526 ms
467 [time] &#39;Bytecode Generation&#39;             5177 ms
468 [time] &#39;Class Installation&#39;              1854 ms
469 [time] 
470 [time] Total runtime: 11994 ms (Non-runtime: 11027 ms [91%])
471 
472 * methodhandles
473 
474 If this logger is enabled, each MethodHandle related call that uses
475 the java.lang.invoke package gets its MethodHandle intercepted and an
476 instrumentation printout of arguments and return value appended to
477 it. This shows exactly which method handles are executed and from
478 where. (Also MethodTypes and SwitchPoints).
479 
480 * classcache
481 
482 This logger shows information about reusing code classes using the
483 in-memory class cache. Nashorn will try to avoid compilation of
484 scripts by using existing classes. This can significantly improve
485 performance when repeatedly evaluating the same script.
486 
487 =======================
488 3. Undocumented options
489 =======================
490 
491 Here follows a short description of undocumented options for Nashorn.
492 To see a list of all undocumented options, use the (undocumented) flag
493 &quot;-xhelp&quot;.
494 
495 i.e. jjs -xhelp or java -jar nashorn.jar -xhelp
496 
497 Undocumented options are not guaranteed to work, run correctly or be
498 bug free. They are experimental and for internal or debugging use.
499 They are also subject to change without notice.
500 
501 In practice, though, all options below not explicitly documented as
502 EXPERIMENTAL can be relied upon, for example --dump-on-error is useful
503 for any JavaScript/Nashorn developer, but there is no guarantee.
