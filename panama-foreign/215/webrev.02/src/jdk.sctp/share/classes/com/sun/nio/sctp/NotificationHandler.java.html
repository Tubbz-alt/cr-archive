28  * A handler for consuming notifications from the SCTP stack.
29  *
30  * &lt;P&gt; The SCTP channels defined in this package allow a notification handler to
31  * be specified to consume notifications from the SCTP stack. When a
32  * notification is received the {@linkplain #handleNotification
33  * handleNotification} method of the handler is invoked to handle that
34  * notification.
35  *
36  * &lt;P&gt; Additionally, an attachment object can be attached to the {@code receive}
37  * operation to provide context when consuming the notification. The
38  * attachment is important for cases where a &lt;i&gt;state-less&lt;/i&gt; {@code
39  * NotificationHandler} is used to consume the result of many {@code receive}
40  * operations.
41  *
42  * &lt;P&gt; Handler implementations are encouraged to extend the {@link
43  * AbstractNotificationHandler} class which implements this interface and
44  * provide notification specific methods. However, an API should generally use
45  * this handler interface as the type for parameters, return type, etc. rather
46  * than the abstract class.
47  *
48  * @param  &lt;T&gt;  The type of the object attached to the receive operation
49  *
50  * @since 1.7
