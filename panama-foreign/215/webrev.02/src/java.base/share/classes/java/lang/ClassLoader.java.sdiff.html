 129  * The Java run-time has the following built-in class loaders:
 130  *
 131  * &lt;ul&gt;
 132  * &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bootstrap class loader.
 133  *     It is the virtual machine&#39;s built-in class loader, typically represented
 134  *     as {@code null}, and does not have a parent.&lt;/li&gt;
 135  * &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;{@linkplain #getPlatformClassLoader() Platform class loader}.
<span class="line-modified"> 136  *     All &lt;em&gt;platform classes&lt;/em&gt; are visible to the platform class loader</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 137  *     that can be used as the parent of a {@code ClassLoader} instance.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 138  *     Platform classes include Java SE platform APIs, their implementation</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 139  *     classes and JDK-specific run-time classes that are defined by the</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 140  *     platform class loader or its ancestors.</span>

 141  *     &lt;p&gt; To allow for upgrading/overriding of modules defined to the platform
 142  *     class loader, and where upgraded modules read modules defined to class
 143  *     loaders other than the platform class loader and its ancestors, then
 144  *     the platform class loader may have to delegate to other class loaders,
 145  *     the application class loader for example.
 146  *     In other words, classes in named modules defined to class loaders
 147  *     other than the platform class loader and its ancestors may be visible
 148  *     to the platform class loader. &lt;/li&gt;
 149  * &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;{@linkplain #getSystemClassLoader() System class loader}.
 150  *     It is also known as &lt;em&gt;application class loader&lt;/em&gt; and is distinct
 151  *     from the platform class loader.
 152  *     The system class loader is typically used to define classes on the
 153  *     application class path, module path, and JDK-specific tools.
<span class="line-modified"> 154  *     The platform class loader is a parent or an ancestor of the system class</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 155  *     loader that all platform classes are visible to it.&lt;/li&gt;</span>

 156  * &lt;/ul&gt;
 157  *
 158  * &lt;p&gt; Normally, the Java virtual machine loads classes from the local file
 159  * system in a platform-dependent manner.
 160  * However, some classes may not originate from a file; they may originate
 161  * from other sources, such as the network, or they could be constructed by an
 162  * application.  The method {@link #defineClass(String, byte[], int, int)
 163  * defineClass} converts an array of bytes into an instance of class
 164  * {@code Class}. Instances of this newly defined class can be created using
 165  * {@link Class#newInstance Class.newInstance}.
 166  *
 167  * &lt;p&gt; The methods and constructors of objects created by a class loader may
 168  * reference other classes.  To determine the class(es) referred to, the Java
 169  * virtual machine invokes the {@link #loadClass loadClass} method of
 170  * the class loader that originally created the class.
 171  *
 172  * &lt;p&gt; For example, an application could create a network class loader to
 173  * download class files from a server.  Sample code might look like:
