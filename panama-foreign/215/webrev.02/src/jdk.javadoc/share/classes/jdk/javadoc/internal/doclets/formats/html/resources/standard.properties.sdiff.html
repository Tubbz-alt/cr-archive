132     How This API Document Is Organized
133 doclet.help.intro=\
134     This API (Application Programming Interface) document has pages corresponding to the items in \
135     the navigation bar, described as follows.
136 doclet.help.overview.modules.body=\
137     The {0} page is the front page of this API document and provides a list of all modules with a \
138     summary for each.  This page can also contain an overall description of the set of modules.
139 doclet.help.overview.packages.body=\
140     The {0} page is the front page of this API document and provides a list of all packages with a \
141     summary for each.  This page can also contain an overall description of the set of packages.
142 doclet.help.package.intro=\
143     Each package has a page that contains a list of its classes and interfaces, with a summary for \
144     each. These pages may contain six categories:
145 doclet.help.module.intro=\
146     Each module has a page that contains a list of its packages, dependencies on other modules, \
<span class="line-modified">147     and services, with a summary for each. These page may contain three categories:</span>
148 doclet.help.class_interface.head=\
149     Class or Interface
150 doclet.help.class_interface.intro=\
151     Each class, interface, nested class and nested interface has its own separate page. Each of \
152     these pages has three sections consisting of a class/interface description, summary tables, \
153     and detailed member descriptions:
154 doclet.help.class_interface.inheritance_diagram=\
155     Class Inheritance Diagram
156 doclet.help.class_interface.subclasses=\
157     Direct Subclasses
158 doclet.help.class_interface.subinterfaces=\
159     All Known Subinterfaces
160 doclet.help.class_interface.implementations=\
161     All Known Implementing Classes
162 doclet.help.class_interface.declaration=\
163     Class or Interface Declaration
164 doclet.help.class_interface.description=\
165     Class or Interface Description
166 doclet.help.class_interface.summary=\
<span class="line-removed">167     Each summary entry contains the first sentence from the detailed description for that item. \</span>
168     The summary entries are alphabetical, while the detailed descriptions are in the order they \
169     appear in the source code. This preserves the logical groupings established by the programmer.
170 doclet.help.use.head=\
171     Use
172 doclet.help.use.body=\
173     Each documented package, class and interface has its own Use page.  This page describes what \
174     packages, classes, methods, constructors and fields use any part of the given class or \
175     package. Given a class or interface A, its &quot;Use&quot; page includes subclasses of A, fields declared \
176     as A, methods that return A, and methods and constructors with parameters of type A.  \
177     You can access this page by first going to the package, class or interface, then clicking on \
178     the &quot;Use&quot; link in the navigation bar.
179 doclet.help.tree.head=\
180     Tree (Class Hierarchy)
181 doclet.help.tree.intro=\
182     There is a {0} page for all packages, plus a hierarchy for each package. Each hierarchy page \
183     contains a list of classes and a list of interfaces. Classes are organized by inheritance \
184     structure starting with {1}. Interfaces do not inherit from {1}.
185 doclet.help.tree.overview=\
186     When viewing the Overview page, clicking on &quot;Tree&quot; displays the hierarchy for all packages.
187 doclet.help.tree.package=\
188     When viewing a particular package, class or interface page, clicking on &quot;Tree&quot; displays the \
189     hierarchy for only that package.
190 doclet.help.deprecated.body=\
191     The {0} page lists all of the API that have been deprecated. A deprecated API is not \
<span class="line-modified">192     recommended for use, generally due to improvements, and a replacement API is usually given. \</span>
193     Deprecated APIs may be removed in future implementations.
194 doclet.help.index.head=\
195     Index
196 doclet.help.index.body=\
197     The {0} contains an alphabetic index of all classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, \
198     and fields, as well as lists of all packages and all classes.
199 doclet.help.serial_form.body=\
200     Each serializable or externalizable class has a description of its serialization fields and \
<span class="line-modified">201     methods. This information is of interest to re-implementors, not to developers using the API. \</span>
202     While there is no link in the navigation bar, you can get to this information by going to any \
<span class="line-modified">203     serialized class and clicking &quot;Serialized Form&quot; in the &quot;See also&quot; section of the class \</span>
204     description.
205 doclet.help.constants.body=\
206     The {0} page lists the static final fields and their values.
207 doclet.help.footnote=\
208     This help file applies to API documentation generated by the standard doclet.
209 doclet.help.enum.intro=\
210     Each enum has its own separate page with the following sections:
211 doclet.help.enum.declaration=\
212     Enum Declaration
213 doclet.help.enum.definition=\
214     Enum Description
215 doclet.help.annotation_type.intro=\
216     Each annotation type has its own separate page with the following sections:
217 doclet.help.annotation_type.declaration=\
218     Annotation Type Declaration
219 doclet.help.annotation_type.description=\
220     Annotation Type Description
221 doclet.help.search.head=Search
