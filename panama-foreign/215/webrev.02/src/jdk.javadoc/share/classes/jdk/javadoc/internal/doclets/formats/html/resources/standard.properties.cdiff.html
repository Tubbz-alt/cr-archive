      The summary entries are alphabetical, while the detailed descriptions are in the order they \

  doclet.help.tree.package=\
      When viewing a particular package, class or interface page, clicking on &quot;Tree&quot; displays the \
      hierarchy for only that package.
  doclet.help.deprecated.body=\
      The {0} page lists all of the API that have been deprecated. A deprecated API is not \
<span class="line-modified">!     recommended for use, generally due to improvements, and a replacement API is usually given. \</span>
      Deprecated APIs may be removed in future implementations.
  doclet.help.index.head=\
      Index
  doclet.help.index.body=\
      The {0} contains an alphabetic index of all classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, \
      and fields, as well as lists of all packages and all classes.
  doclet.help.serial_form.body=\
      Each serializable or externalizable class has a description of its serialization fields and \
<span class="line-modified">!     methods. This information is of interest to re-implementors, not to developers using the API. \</span>
      While there is no link in the navigation bar, you can get to this information by going to any \
<span class="line-modified">!     serialized class and clicking &quot;Serialized Form&quot; in the &quot;See also&quot; section of the class \</span>
      description.
  doclet.help.constants.body=\
      The {0} page lists the static final fields and their values.
