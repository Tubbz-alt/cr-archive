   * A memory segment models a contiguous region of memory. A memory segment is associated with both spatial
   * and temporal bounds. Spatial bounds ensure that memory access operations on a memory segment cannot affect a memory location
   * which falls &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment being accessed. Temporal checks ensure that memory access

   * resources associated with it are released; this has different meanings depending on the kind of memory segment being
   * considered:
   * &lt;ul&gt;
   *     &lt;li&gt;closing a native memory segment results in &lt;em&gt;freeing&lt;/em&gt; the native memory associated with it&lt;/li&gt;
   *     &lt;li&gt;closing a mapped memory segment results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped&lt;/li&gt;
<span class="line-removed">-  *     &lt;li&gt;closing an acquired memory segment &lt;b&gt;does not&lt;/b&gt; result in the release of resources</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  *     (see the section on &lt;a href=&quot;#thread-confinement&quot;&gt;thread confinement&lt;/a&gt; for more details)&lt;/li&gt;</span>
   *     &lt;li&gt;closing a buffer, or a heap segment does not have any side-effect, other than marking the segment
   *     as &lt;em&gt;not alive&lt;/em&gt; (see {@link MemorySegment#isAlive()}). Also, since the buffer and heap segments might keep
   *     strong references to the original buffer or array instance, it is the responsibility of clients to ensure that
   *     these segments are discarded in a timely manner, so as not to prevent garbage collection to reclaim the underlying
   *     objects.&lt;/li&gt;

   * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with

<span class="line-modified">!  * memory segment does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trigger any deallocation action. It is therefore important that clients remember to</span>
