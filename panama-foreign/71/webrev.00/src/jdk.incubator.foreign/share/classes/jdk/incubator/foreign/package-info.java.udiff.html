   * the segment it belongs to has not been closed prematurely. We call this guarantee &lt;em&gt;temporal safety&lt;/em&gt;. Note that,
   * in the general case, guaranteeing temporal safety can be hard, as multiple threads could attempt to access and/or close
   * the same memory segment concurrently. The memory access API addresses this problem by imposing strong
   * &lt;a href=&quot;MemorySegment.html#thread-confinement&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;thread-confinement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; guarantees on memory segments: each
   * memory segment is associated with an owner thread, which is the only thread that can either access or close the segment.
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * A thread other than the owner thread will have to explicitly &lt;em&gt;acquire&lt;/em&gt; a segment in order to be able to use it.</span>
   * &lt;p&gt;
   * Together, spatial and temporal safety ensure that each memory access operation either succeeds - and accesses a valid
   * memory location - or fails.
