 80  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a native memory segment results in &lt;em&gt;freeing&lt;/em&gt; the native memory associated with it&lt;/li&gt;
 81  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a mapped memory segment results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped&lt;/li&gt;
 82  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a buffer, or a heap segment does not have any side-effect, other than marking the segment
 83  *     as &lt;em&gt;not alive&lt;/em&gt; (see {@link MemorySegment#isAlive()}). Also, since the buffer and heap segments might keep
 84  *     strong references to the original buffer or array instance, it is the responsibility of clients to ensure that
 85  *     these segments are discarded in a timely manner, so as not to prevent garbage collection to reclaim the underlying
 86  *     objects.&lt;/li&gt;
 87  * &lt;/ul&gt;
 88  *
 89  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;thread-confinement&quot;&gt;Thread confinement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 90  *
 91  * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,
 92  * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
 93  * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
 94  * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
 95  * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
 96  * &lt;p&gt;
 97  * In some cases, it might be useful for multiple threads to process the contents of the same memory segment concurrently
<span class="line-modified"> 98  * (e.g. in the case of parallel processing); while memory segments provide string confinement guarantees, it is possible</span>
 99  * to obtain a {@link Spliterator} from a segment, which can be used to slice the segment and allow multiple thread to
100  * work in parallel on disjoint segment slices (this assumes that the access mode {@link #ACQUIRE} is set).
101  * For instance, the following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:
102  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
103 SequenceLayout SEQUENCE_LAYOUT = MemoryLayout.ofSequence(1024, MemoryLayouts.JAVA_INT);
104 VarHandle VH_int = SEQUENCE_LAYOUT.elementLayout().varHandle(int.class);
105 int sum = StreamSupport.stream(segment.spliterator(SEQUENCE_LAYOUT), true)
106             .mapToInt(segment -&gt; (int)VH_int.get(segment.baseAddress))
107             .sum();
108  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
109  *
110  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;access-modes&quot;&gt;Access modes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
111  *
112  * Memory segments supports zero or more &lt;em&gt;access modes&lt;/em&gt;. Supported access modes are {@link #READ},
113  * {@link #WRITE}, {@link #CLOSE} and {@link #ACQUIRE}. The set of access modes supported by a segment alters the
114  * set of operations that are supported by that segment. For instance, attempting to call {@link #close()} on
115  * a segment which does not support the {@link #CLOSE} access mode will result in an exception.
116  * &lt;p&gt;
117  * The set of supported access modes can only be made stricter (by supporting &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; access modes). This means
118  * that restricting the set of access modes supported by a segment before sharing it with other clients

140  * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
141  * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
142  * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory address from which they originated.
143  *
