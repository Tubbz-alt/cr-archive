   * &lt;h2&gt;Constructing memory segments from different sources&lt;/h2&gt;
   *
   * There are multiple ways to obtain a memory segment. First, memory segments backed by off-heap memory can
   * be allocated using one of the many factory methods provided (see {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(MemoryLayout)},
   * {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)} and {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long, long)}). Memory segments obtained
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;native memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * in this way are backed by a &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; memory source (see {@link MemorySource}).</span>
   * &lt;p&gt;
   * It is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing heap-allocated Java array,
   * using one of the provided factory methods (e.g. {@link MemorySegment#ofArray(int[])}). Memory segments obtained
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;array memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * in this way are backed by a &lt;em&gt;heap&lt;/em&gt; memory source (see {@link MemorySource}).</span>
   * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * It is possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing Java byte buffer (see {@link ByteBuffer}),</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * using the factory method {@link MemorySegment#ofByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)}.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * Memory segments obtained in this way are called &lt;em&gt;buffer memory segments&lt;/em&gt;. Note that buffer memory segments might</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * be backed by native memory (as in the case of native memory segments) or heap memory (as in the case of array memory segments),</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * depending on the characteristics of the byte buffer instance the segment is associated with. For instance, a buffer memory</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * segment obtained from a byte buffer created with the {@link ByteBuffer#allocateDirect(int)} method will be backed</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * by native memory.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * It is possible to obtain a memory segment backed by a memory-mapped file using the factory method</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * {@link MemorySegment#mapFromPath(Path, long, FileChannel.MapMode)}. Such memory segments are backed by a</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * &lt;em&gt;mapped&lt;/em&gt; memory source (see {@link MappedMemorySource}).</span>
   * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * Finally, it is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by a memory-mapped file using the factory method</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * {@link MemorySegment#mapFromPath(Path, long, FileChannel.MapMode)}. Such memory segments are called &lt;em&gt;mapped memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * Finally, it is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing Java byte buffer (see {@link ByteBuffer}),</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * using the factory method {@link MemorySegment#ofByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)}. Memory segments obtained in this can be</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * backed by a native memory source, an heap memory source, or a mapped memory source, depending on the characteristics</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * of the byte buffer instance the segment is associated with. For instance, a memory segment obtained from a byte buffer</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * created with the {@link ByteBuffer#allocateDirect(int)} method will be backed by a native memory source; a memory segment</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * obtained from a byte buffer created with the {@link ByteBuffer#allocate(int)} will be backed by a heap memory source;</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * finally, a memory segment obtained from a byte buffer created with the {@link FileChannel#map(FileChannel.MapMode, long, long)} method</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * will be backed by a mapped memory source.</span>
   *
   * &lt;h2&gt;Closing a memory segment&lt;/h2&gt;
   *
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * Memory segments are closed explicitly (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}). In general when a segment is closed, all off-heap</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * resources associated with it are released; this has different meanings depending on the kind of memory segment being</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * considered:</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * &lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a native memory segment results in &lt;em&gt;freeing&lt;/em&gt; the native memory associated with it&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a mapped memory segment results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  *     &lt;li&gt;closing an acquired memory segment &lt;b&gt;does not&lt;/b&gt; result in the release of resources</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  *     (see the section on &lt;a href=&quot;#thread-confinement&quot;&gt;thread confinement&lt;/a&gt; for more details)&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a buffer, or a heap segment does not have any side-effect, other than marking the segment</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  *     as &lt;em&gt;not alive&lt;/em&gt; (see {@link MemorySegment#isAlive()}). Also, since the buffer and heap segments might keep</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  *     strong references to the original buffer or array instance, it is the responsibility of clients to ensure that</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  *     these segments are discarded in a timely manner, so as not to prevent garbage collection to reclaim the underlying</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  *     objects.&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * &lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * Memory segments are closed explicitly (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}). When a memory segment is closed,</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * the segment, and all memory addresses (see {@link MemoryAddress}) derived from it are rendered invalid. This means</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * that e.g. dereferencing a memory address derived from a segment that has been closed will result in a runtime</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * exception. Closing a memory segment &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; additionally result in &lt;a href=&quot;MemorySource.html#releasing-sources&quot;&gt;</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * releasing&lt;/a&gt; the memory source backing that memory segment.</span>
   *
   * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;thread-confinement&quot;&gt;Thread confinement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
   *
   * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,
   * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
   * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
   * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
   * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
   * &lt;p&gt;
   * If a memory segment S owned by thread A needs to be used by thread B, B needs to explicitly &lt;em&gt;acquire&lt;/em&gt; S,
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * which will create a so called &lt;em&gt;acquired&lt;/em&gt; memory segment owned by B (see {@link #acquire()}) backed by the same resources</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * as S. A memory segment can be acquired multiple times by one or more threads; in that case, a memory segment S cannot</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * be closed until all the acquired memory segments derived from S have been closed. Furthermore, closing an acquired</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * memory segment does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trigger any deallocation action. It is therefore important that clients remember to</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * explicitly close the original segment from which the acquired memory segments have been obtained in order to truly</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * ensure that off-heap resources associated with the memory segment are released.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * which will create a new memory segment owned by B (see {@link #acquire()}) backed by the same memory</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * source as S. A memory segment can be acquired multiple times by one or more threads; in that case, the underlying memory</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * source will not be released until &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the memory segments derived from it have been closed.</span>
   *
   * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;access-modes&quot;&gt;Access modes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
   *
   * Memory segments supports zero or more &lt;em&gt;access modes&lt;/em&gt;. Supported access modes are {@link #READ},
   * {@link #WRITE}, {@link #CLOSE} and {@link #ACQUIRE}. The set of access modes supported by a segment alters the
