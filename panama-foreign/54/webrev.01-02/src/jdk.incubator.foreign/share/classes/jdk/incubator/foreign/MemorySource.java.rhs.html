29  * A memory source describes an underlying memory region with specific size and kind. Supported memory sources are:
30  * on-heap sources, native sources or mapped sources. Memory sources cannot be allocated or released explicitly - instead,
31  * clients need to operate on them using a memory segment (see {@link MemorySegment}). In other words, a memory segment
32  * can be thought of as a &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; over a given memory source.
33  *
34  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;releasing-sources&quot;&gt;Releasing memory sources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
35  *
36  * When &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; memory segments associated with a given memory source have been closed explicitly
37  * (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}), or, alternatively, when all said segments are deemed &lt;em&gt;unreacheable&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;
38  * the memory source has been registered against a cleaner (see {@link MemorySource#registerCleaner()}), the memory source
39  * is &lt;em&gt;released&lt;/em&gt;; this has different meanings depending on the kind of memory source being considered:
40  * &lt;ul&gt;
41  *     &lt;li&gt;releasing a native memory source results in &lt;em&gt;freeing&lt;/em&gt; the native memory associated with it&lt;/li&gt;
42  *     &lt;li&gt;releasing a mapped memory source results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped&lt;/li&gt;
43  *     &lt;li&gt;releasing a heap memory source does not have any side-effect; since heap memory sources might keep
44  *     strong references to the original heap-based object, it is the responsibility of clients to ensure that
45  *     all segments referring to the released heap source are discarded in a timely manner, so as not to prevent garbage
46  *     collection to reclaim the underlying objects.&lt;/li&gt;
47  * &lt;/ul&gt;
48  *
49  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySource}
50  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
51  * explicitly permitted types.
