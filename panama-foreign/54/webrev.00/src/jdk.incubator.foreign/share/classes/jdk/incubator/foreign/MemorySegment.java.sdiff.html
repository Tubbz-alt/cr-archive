<span class="line-modified"> 38  * A memory segment models a contiguous region of memory. A memory segment is associated with both spatial</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 39  * and temporal bounds. Spatial bounds ensure that memory access operations on a memory segment cannot affect a memory location</span>
 40  * which falls &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment being accessed. Temporal checks ensure that memory access
 41  * operations on a segment cannot occur after a memory segment has been closed (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}).
 42  * &lt;p&gt;
 43  * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
 44  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 45  * instances of {@code MemorySegment} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 46  * be used for comparisons.
 47  * &lt;p&gt;
 48  * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemorySegment} directly.
 49  *
 50  * &lt;h2&gt;Constructing memory segments from different sources&lt;/h2&gt;
 51  *
 52  * There are multiple ways to obtain a memory segment. First, memory segments backed by off-heap memory can
 53  * be allocated using one of the many factory methods provided (see {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(MemoryLayout)},
 54  * {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)} and {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long, long)}). Memory segments obtained
<span class="line-modified"> 55  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;native memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.</span>
 56  * &lt;p&gt;
 57  * It is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing heap-allocated Java array,
 58  * using one of the provided factory methods (e.g. {@link MemorySegment#ofArray(int[])}). Memory segments obtained
<span class="line-modified"> 59  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;array memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.</span>
 60  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 61  * It is possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing Java byte buffer (see {@link ByteBuffer}),</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 62  * using the factory method {@link MemorySegment#ofByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)}.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 63  * Memory segments obtained in this way are called &lt;em&gt;buffer memory segments&lt;/em&gt;. Note that buffer memory segments might</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 64  * be backed by native memory (as in the case of native memory segments) or heap memory (as in the case of array memory segments),</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 65  * depending on the characteristics of the byte buffer instance the segment is associated with. For instance, a buffer memory</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 66  * segment obtained from a byte buffer created with the {@link ByteBuffer#allocateDirect(int)} method will be backed</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 67  * by native memory.</span>
 68  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 69  * Finally, it is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by a memory-mapped file using the factory method</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 70  * {@link MemorySegment#mapFromPath(Path, long, FileChannel.MapMode)}. Such memory segments are called &lt;em&gt;mapped memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.</span>






 71  *
 72  * &lt;h2&gt;Closing a memory segment&lt;/h2&gt;
 73  *
<span class="line-modified"> 74  * Memory segments are closed explicitly (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}). In general when a segment is closed, all off-heap</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 75  * resources associated with it are released; this has different meanings depending on the kind of memory segment being</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 76  * considered:</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 77  * &lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 78  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a native memory segment results in &lt;em&gt;freeing&lt;/em&gt; the native memory associated with it&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 79  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a mapped memory segment results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 80  *     &lt;li&gt;closing an acquired memory segment &lt;b&gt;does not&lt;/b&gt; result in the release of resources</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 81  *     (see the section on &lt;a href=&quot;#thread-confinement&quot;&gt;thread confinement&lt;/a&gt; for more details)&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 82  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a buffer, or a heap segment does not have any side-effect, other than marking the segment</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 83  *     as &lt;em&gt;not alive&lt;/em&gt; (see {@link MemorySegment#isAlive()}). Also, since the buffer and heap segments might keep</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 84  *     strong references to the original buffer or array instance, it is the responsibility of clients to ensure that</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 85  *     these segments are discarded in a timely manner, so as not to prevent garbage collection to reclaim the underlying</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 86  *     objects.&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 87  * &lt;/ul&gt;</span>
 88  *
 89  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;thread-confinement&quot;&gt;Thread confinement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 90  *
 91  * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,
 92  * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
 93  * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
 94  * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
 95  * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
 96  * &lt;p&gt;
 97  * If a memory segment S owned by thread A needs to be used by thread B, B needs to explicitly &lt;em&gt;acquire&lt;/em&gt; S,
<span class="line-modified"> 98  * which will create a so called &lt;em&gt;acquired&lt;/em&gt; memory segment owned by B (see {@link #acquire()}) backed by the same resources</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 99  * as S. A memory segment can be acquired multiple times by one or more threads; in that case, a memory segment S cannot</span>
<span class="line-modified">100  * be closed until all the acquired memory segments derived from S have been closed. Furthermore, closing an acquired</span>
<span class="line-removed">101  * memory segment does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trigger any deallocation action. It is therefore important that clients remember to</span>
<span class="line-removed">102  * explicitly close the original segment from which the acquired memory segments have been obtained in order to truly</span>
<span class="line-removed">103  * ensure that off-heap resources associated with the memory segment are released.</span>
104  *
105  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;access-modes&quot;&gt;Access modes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
106  *
107  * Memory segments supports zero or more &lt;em&gt;access modes&lt;/em&gt;. Supported access modes are {@link #READ},
108  * {@link #WRITE}, {@link #CLOSE} and {@link #ACQUIRE}. The set of access modes supported by a segment alters the
109  * set of operations that are supported by that segment. For instance, attempting to call {@link #close()} on
110  * a segment which does not support the {@link #CLOSE} access mode will result in an exception.
111  * &lt;p&gt;
112  * The set of supported access modes can only be made stricter (by supporting &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; access modes). This means
113  * that restricting the set of access modes supported by a segment before sharing it with other clients
114  * is generally a good practice if the creator of the segment wants to retain some control over how the segment
115  * is going to be accessed.
116  *
117  * &lt;h2&gt;Memory segment views&lt;/h2&gt;
118  *
119  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, it is possible to alter the set of supported access modes,
120  * by creating an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; view of a memory segment, as follows:
121  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
122 MemorySegment segment = ...
123 MemorySegment roSegment = segment.withAccessModes(segment.accessModes() &amp; ~WRITE);
</pre>
<hr />
<pre>
135  * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
136  * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
137  * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory address from which they originated.
138  *
139  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
140  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
141  * explicitly permitted types.
142  *
143  * @implSpec
144  * Implementations of this interface are immutable and thread-safe.

<span class="line-modified"> 38  * A memory segment is a view over a given memory source (see {@link MemorySource}), which is associated with both spatial</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 39  * and temporal &lt;em&gt;bounds&lt;/em&gt;. Spatial bounds ensure that memory access operations on a memory segment cannot affect a memory location</span>
 40  * which falls &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment being accessed. Temporal checks ensure that memory access
 41  * operations on a segment cannot occur after a memory segment has been closed (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}).
 42  * &lt;p&gt;
 43  * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
 44  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 45  * instances of {@code MemorySegment} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 46  * be used for comparisons.
 47  * &lt;p&gt;
 48  * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemorySegment} directly.
 49  *
 50  * &lt;h2&gt;Constructing memory segments from different sources&lt;/h2&gt;
 51  *
 52  * There are multiple ways to obtain a memory segment. First, memory segments backed by off-heap memory can
 53  * be allocated using one of the many factory methods provided (see {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(MemoryLayout)},
 54  * {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)} and {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long, long)}). Memory segments obtained
<span class="line-modified"> 55  * in this way are backed by a &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; memory source (see {@link MemorySource}).</span>
 56  * &lt;p&gt;
 57  * It is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing heap-allocated Java array,
 58  * using one of the provided factory methods (e.g. {@link MemorySegment#ofArray(int[])}). Memory segments obtained
<span class="line-modified"> 59  * in this way are backed by a &lt;em&gt;heap&lt;/em&gt; memory source (see {@link MemorySource}).</span>
 60  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 61  * It is possible to obtain a memory segment backed by a memory-mapped file using the factory method</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 62  * {@link MemorySegment#mapFromPath(Path, long, FileChannel.MapMode)}. Such memory segments are backed by a</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 63  * &lt;em&gt;mapped&lt;/em&gt; memory source (see {@link MappedMemorySource}).</span>




 64  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 65  * Finally, it is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing Java byte buffer (see {@link ByteBuffer}),</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 66  * using the factory method {@link MemorySegment#ofByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)}. Memory segments obtained in this can be</span>
<span class="line-added"> 67  * backed by a native memory source, an heap memory source, or a mapped memory source, depending on the characteristics</span>
<span class="line-added"> 68  * of the byte buffer instance the segment is associated with. For instance, a memory segment obtained from a byte buffer</span>
<span class="line-added"> 69  * created with the {@link ByteBuffer#allocateDirect(int)} method will be backed by a native memory source; a memory segment</span>
<span class="line-added"> 70  * obtained from a byte buffer created with the {@link ByteBuffer#allocate(int)} will be backed by a heap memory source;</span>
<span class="line-added"> 71  * finally, a memory segment obtained from a byte buffer created with the {@link FileChannel#map(FileChannel.MapMode, long, long)} method</span>
<span class="line-added"> 72  * will be backed by a mapped memory source.</span>
 73  *
 74  * &lt;h2&gt;Closing a memory segment&lt;/h2&gt;
 75  *
<span class="line-modified"> 76  * Memory segments are closed explicitly (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}). When a memory segment is closed,</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 77  * the segment, and all memory addresses (see {@link MemoryAddress}) derived from it are rendered invalid. This means</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 78  * that e.g. dereferencing a memory address derived from a segment that has been closed will result in a runtime</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 79  * exception. Closing a memory segment &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; additionally result in &lt;a href=&quot;MemorySource.html#releasing-sources&quot;&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 80  * releasing&lt;/a&gt; the memory source backing that memory segment.</span>









 81  *
 82  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;thread-confinement&quot;&gt;Thread confinement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 83  *
 84  * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,
 85  * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
 86  * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
 87  * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
 88  * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
 89  * &lt;p&gt;
 90  * If a memory segment S owned by thread A needs to be used by thread B, B needs to explicitly &lt;em&gt;acquire&lt;/em&gt; S,
<span class="line-modified"> 91  * which will create a new memory segment owned by B (see {@link #acquire()}) backed by the same memory</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 92  * source as S. A memory segment can be acquired multiple times by one or more threads; in that case, the underlying memory</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 93  * source will not be released until &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the memory segments derived from it have been closed.</span>



 94  *
 95  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;access-modes&quot;&gt;Access modes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 96  *
 97  * Memory segments supports zero or more &lt;em&gt;access modes&lt;/em&gt;. Supported access modes are {@link #READ},
 98  * {@link #WRITE}, {@link #CLOSE} and {@link #ACQUIRE}. The set of access modes supported by a segment alters the
 99  * set of operations that are supported by that segment. For instance, attempting to call {@link #close()} on
100  * a segment which does not support the {@link #CLOSE} access mode will result in an exception.
101  * &lt;p&gt;
102  * The set of supported access modes can only be made stricter (by supporting &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; access modes). This means
103  * that restricting the set of access modes supported by a segment before sharing it with other clients
104  * is generally a good practice if the creator of the segment wants to retain some control over how the segment
105  * is going to be accessed.
106  *
107  * &lt;h2&gt;Memory segment views&lt;/h2&gt;
108  *
109  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, it is possible to alter the set of supported access modes,
110  * by creating an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; view of a memory segment, as follows:
111  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
112 MemorySegment segment = ...
113 MemorySegment roSegment = segment.withAccessModes(segment.accessModes() &amp; ~WRITE);
</pre>
<hr />
<pre>
125  * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
126  * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
127  * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory address from which they originated.
128  *
129  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
130  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
131  * explicitly permitted types.
132  *
