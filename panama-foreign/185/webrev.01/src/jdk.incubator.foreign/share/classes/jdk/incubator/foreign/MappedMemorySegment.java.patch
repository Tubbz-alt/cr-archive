  * A mapped memory segment, that is, a memory segment backed by memory-mapped file.

  * <p> Mapped memory segments are created via the {@link MemorySegment#mapFromPath(Path, long, FileChannel.MapMode)}.
- * Mapped memory segments behave like ordinary segments, but also provide additional capabilities that are specific to

  * All implementations of this interface must be <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>;
  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
  * instances of {@code MemoryLayout} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
  * be used for comparisons.
