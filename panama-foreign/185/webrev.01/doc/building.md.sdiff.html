 817 ## Running Tests
 818 
 819 Most of the JDK tests are using the [JTReg](http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg)
 820 test framework. Make sure that your configuration knows where to find your
 821 installation of JTReg. If this is not picked up automatically, use the
 822 `--with-jtreg=&lt;path to jtreg home&gt;` option to point to the JTReg framework.
 823 Note that this option should point to the JTReg home, i.e. the top directory,
 824 containing `lib/jtreg.jar` etc.
 825 
 826 The [Adoption Group](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Adoption) provides
 827 recent builds of jtreg [here](
 828 https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/Dependencies/job/jtreg/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact).
 829 Download the latest `.tar.gz` file, unpack it, and point `--with-jtreg` to the
 830 `jtreg` directory that you just unpacked.
 831 








 832 To execute the most basic tests (tier 1), use:
 833 ```
 834 make run-test-tier1
 835 ```
 836 
 837 For more details on how to run tests, please see the [Testing
 838 the JDK](testing.html) document.

 840 ## Cross-compiling
 841 
 842 Cross-compiling means using one platform (the *build* platform) to generate
 843 output that can ran on another platform (the *target* platform).
 844 
 845 The typical reason for cross-compiling is that the build is performed on a more
 846 powerful desktop computer, but the resulting binaries will be able to run on a
 847 different, typically low-performing system. Most of the complications that
 848 arise when building for embedded is due to this separation of *build* and
 849 *target* systems.
 850 
 851 This requires a more complex setup and build procedure. This section assumes
