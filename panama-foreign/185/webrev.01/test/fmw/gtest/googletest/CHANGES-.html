  1 Changes for 1.7.0:
  2 
  3 * New feature: death tests are supported on OpenBSD and in iOS
  4   simulator now.
  5 * New feature: Google Test now implements a protocol to allow
  6   a test runner to detect that a test program has exited
  7   prematurely and report it as a failure (before it would be
  8   falsely reported as a success if the exit code is 0).
  9 * New feature: Test::RecordProperty() can now be used outside of the
 10   lifespan of a test method, in which case it will be attributed to
 11   the current test case or the test program in the XML report.
 12 * New feature (potentially breaking): --gtest_list_tests now prints
 13   the type parameters and value parameters for each test.
 14 * Improvement: char pointers and char arrays are now escaped properly
 15   in failure messages.
 16 * Improvement: failure summary in XML reports now includes file and
 17   line information.
 18 * Improvement: the &lt;testsuites&gt; XML element now has a timestamp attribute.
 19 * Improvement: When --gtest_filter is specified, XML report now doesn&#39;t
 20   contain information about tests that are filtered out.
 21 * Fixed the bug where long --gtest_filter flag values are truncated in
 22   death tests.
 23 * Potentially breaking change: RUN_ALL_TESTS() is now implemented as a
 24   function instead of a macro in order to work better with Clang.
 25 * Compatibility fixes with C++ 11 and various platforms.
 26 * Bug/warning fixes.
 27 
 28 Changes for 1.6.0:
 29 
 30 * New feature: ADD_FAILURE_AT() for reporting a test failure at the
 31   given source location -- useful for writing testing utilities.
 32 * New feature: the universal value printer is moved from Google Mock
 33   to Google Test.
 34 * New feature: type parameters and value parameters are reported in
 35   the XML report now.
 36 * A gtest_disable_pthreads CMake option.
 37 * Colored output works in GNU Screen sessions now.
 38 * Parameters of value-parameterized tests are now printed in the
 39   textual output.
 40 * Failures from ad hoc test assertions run before RUN_ALL_TESTS() are
 41   now correctly reported.
 42 * Arguments of ASSERT_XY and EXPECT_XY no longer need to support &lt;&lt; to
 43   ostream.
 44 * More complete handling of exceptions.
 45 * GTEST_ASSERT_XY can be used instead of ASSERT_XY in case the latter
 46   name is already used by another library.
 47 * --gtest_catch_exceptions is now true by default, allowing a test
 48   program to continue after an exception is thrown.
 49 * Value-parameterized test fixtures can now derive from Test and
 50   WithParamInterface&lt;T&gt; separately, easing conversion of legacy tests.
 51 * Death test messages are clearly marked to make them more
 52   distinguishable from other messages.
 53 * Compatibility fixes for Android, Google Native Client, MinGW, HP UX,
 54   PowerPC, Lucid autotools, libCStd, Sun C++, Borland C++ Builder (Code Gear),
 55   IBM XL C++ (Visual Age C++), and C++0x.
 56 * Bug fixes and implementation clean-ups.
 57 * Potentially incompatible changes: disables the harmful &#39;make install&#39;
 58   command in autotools.
 59 
 60 Changes for 1.5.0:
 61 
 62  * New feature: assertions can be safely called in multiple threads
 63    where the pthreads library is available.
 64  * New feature: predicates used inside EXPECT_TRUE() and friends
 65    can now generate custom failure messages.
 66  * New feature: Google Test can now be compiled as a DLL.
 67  * New feature: fused source files are included.
 68  * New feature: prints help when encountering unrecognized Google Test flags.
 69  * Experimental feature: CMake build script (requires CMake 2.6.4+).
 70  * Experimental feature: the Pump script for meta programming.
 71  * double values streamed to an assertion are printed with enough precision
 72    to differentiate any two different values.
 73  * Google Test now works on Solaris and AIX.
 74  * Build and test script improvements.
 75  * Bug fixes and implementation clean-ups.
 76 
 77  Potentially breaking changes:
 78 
 79  * Stopped supporting VC++ 7.1 with exceptions disabled.
 80  * Dropped support for &#39;make install&#39;.
 81 
 82 Changes for 1.4.0:
 83 
 84  * New feature: the event listener API
 85  * New feature: test shuffling
 86  * New feature: the XML report format is closer to junitreport and can
 87    be parsed by Hudson now.
 88  * New feature: when a test runs under Visual Studio, its failures are
 89    integrated in the IDE.
 90  * New feature: /MD(d) versions of VC++ projects.
 91  * New feature: elapsed time for the tests is printed by default.
 92  * New feature: comes with a TR1 tuple implementation such that Boost
 93    is no longer needed for Combine().
 94  * New feature: EXPECT_DEATH_IF_SUPPORTED macro and friends.
 95  * New feature: the Xcode project can now produce static gtest
 96    libraries in addition to a framework.
 97  * Compatibility fixes for Solaris, Cygwin, minGW, Windows Mobile,
 98    Symbian, gcc, and C++Builder.
 99  * Bug fixes and implementation clean-ups.
100 
101 Changes for 1.3.0:
102 
103  * New feature: death tests on Windows, Cygwin, and Mac.
104  * New feature: ability to use Google Test assertions in other testing
105    frameworks.
106  * New feature: ability to run disabled test via
107    --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests.
108  * New feature: the --help flag for printing the usage.
109  * New feature: access to Google Test flag values in user code.
110  * New feature: a script that packs Google Test into one .h and one
111    .cc file for easy deployment.
112  * New feature: support for distributing test functions to multiple
113    machines (requires support from the test runner).
114  * Bug fixes and implementation clean-ups.
115
