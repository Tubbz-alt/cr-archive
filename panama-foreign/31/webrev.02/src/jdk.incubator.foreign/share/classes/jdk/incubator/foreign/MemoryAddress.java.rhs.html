 34  * A memory address encodes an offset within a given {@link MemorySegment}. Memory addresses are typically obtained
 35  * using the {@link MemorySegment#baseAddress()} method; such addresses can then be adjusted as required,
 36  * using {@link MemoryAddress#addOffset(long)}.
 37  * &lt;p&gt;
 38  * A memory address is typically used as the first argument in a memory access var handle call, to perform some operation
 39  * on the underlying memory backing a given memory segment. Since a memory address is always associated with a memory segment,
 40  * such access operations are always subject to spatial and temporal checks as enforced by the address&#39; owning memory region.
 41  * &lt;p&gt;
 42  * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
 43  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 44  * instances of {@code MemoryAddress} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 45  * be used for comparisons.
 46  * &lt;p&gt;
 47  * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemoryAddress} directly.
 48  *
 49  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemoryAddress}
 50  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
 51  * explicitly permitted types.
 52  *
 53  * @implSpec
 54  * Implementations of this interface are immutable and thread-safe.
