 39  * A memory segment models a contiguous region of memory. A memory segment is associated with both spatial
 40  * and temporal bounds. Spatial bounds ensure that memory access operations on a memory segment cannot affect a memory location
 41  * which falls &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment being accessed. Temporal checks ensure that memory access
 42  * operations on a segment cannot occur after a memory segment has been closed (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}).
 43  * &lt;p&gt;
 44  * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
 45  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 46  * instances of {@code MemorySegment} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 47  * be used for comparisons.
 48  * &lt;p&gt;
 49  * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemorySegment} directly.
 50  *
 51  * &lt;h2&gt;Constructing memory segments from different sources&lt;/h2&gt;
 52  *
 53  * There are multiple ways to obtain a memory segment. First, memory segments backed by off-heap memory can
 54  * be allocated using one of the many factory methods provided (see {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(MemoryLayout)},
 55  * {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)} and {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long, long)}). Memory segments obtained
 56  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;native memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 57  * &lt;p&gt;
 58  * It is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing heap-allocated Java array,
 59  * using one of the provided factory methods (e.g. {@link MemorySegment#ofArray(int[])}). Memory segments obtained
 60  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;array memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 61  * &lt;p&gt;
 62  * It is possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing Java byte buffer (see {@link ByteBuffer}),
 63  * using the factory method {@link MemorySegment#ofByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)}.
 64  * Memory segments obtained in this way are called &lt;em&gt;buffer memory segments&lt;/em&gt;. Note that buffer memory segments might
 65  * be backed by native memory (as in the case of native memory segments) or heap memory (as in the case of array memory segments),
 66  * depending on the characteristics of the byte buffer instance the segment is associated with. For instance, a buffer memory
 67  * segment obtained from a byte buffer created with the {@link ByteBuffer#allocateDirect(int)} method will be backed
 68  * by native memory.
 69  * &lt;p&gt;
 70  * Finally, it is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by a memory-mapped file using the factory method
 71  * {@link MemorySegment#mapFromPath(Path, long, FileChannel.MapMode)}. Such memory segments are called &lt;em&gt;mapped memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 72  *
 73  * &lt;h2&gt;Closing a memory segment&lt;/h2&gt;
 74  *
 75  * Memory segments are closed explicitly (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}). In general when a segment is closed, all off-heap
 76  * resources associated with it are released; this has different meanings depending on the kind of memory segment being
 77  * considered:
 78  * &lt;ul&gt;
 79  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a native memory segment results in &lt;em&gt;freeing&lt;/em&gt; the native memory associated with it&lt;/li&gt;
 80  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a mapped memory segment results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped&lt;/li&gt;
 81  *     &lt;li&gt;closing an acquired memory segment &lt;b&gt;does not&lt;/b&gt; result in the release of resources
 82  *     (see the section on &lt;a href=&quot;#thread-confinement&quot;&gt;thread confinement&lt;/a&gt; for more details)&lt;/li&gt;
 83  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a buffer, or a heap segment does not have any side-effect, other than marking the segment
 84  *     as &lt;em&gt;not alive&lt;/em&gt; (see {@link MemorySegment#isAlive()}). Also, since the buffer and heap segments might keep
 85  *     strong references to the original buffer or array instance, it is the responsibility of clients to ensure that
 86  *     these segments are discarded in a timely manner, so as not to prevent garbage collection to reclaim the underlying
 87  *     objects.&lt;/li&gt;
 88  * &lt;/ul&gt;
 89  *
 90  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;thread-confinement&quot;&gt;Thread confinement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 91  *
 92  * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,
 93  * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
 94  * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
 95  * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
 96  * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
 97  * &lt;p&gt;
 98  * If a memory segment S owned by thread A needs to be used by thread B, B needs to explicitly &lt;em&gt;acquire&lt;/em&gt; S,
 99  * which will create a so called &lt;em&gt;acquired&lt;/em&gt; memory segment owned by B (see {@link #acquire()}) backed by the same resources
100  * as S. A memory segment can be acquired multiple times by one or more threads; in that case, a memory segment S cannot
101  * be closed until all the acquired memory segments derived from S have been closed. Furthermore, closing an acquired
102  * memory segment does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trigger any deallocation action. It is therefore important that clients remember to
103  * explicitly close the original segment from which the acquired memory segments have been obtained in order to truly
104  * ensure that off-heap resources associated with the memory segment are released.
105  *
106  * &lt;h2&gt;Memory segment views&lt;/h2&gt;
107  *
108  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;. It is possible to create an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; view of a memory segment
109  * (see {@link MemorySegment#asReadOnly()}) which does not support write operations. It is also possible to create views
110  * whose spatial bounds are stricter than the ones of the original segment (see {@link MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long)}).
111  * &lt;p&gt;
112  * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
113  * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
114  * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
115  * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as calling
116  * {@link MemorySegment#acquire()} before sharing the view with another client.
117  * &lt;p&gt;
118  * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
119  * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
120  * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
121  * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory address from which they originated.
122  *
123  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
124  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
125  * explicitly permitted types.
126  *
127  * @implSpec
128  * Implementations of this interface are immutable and thread-safe.
