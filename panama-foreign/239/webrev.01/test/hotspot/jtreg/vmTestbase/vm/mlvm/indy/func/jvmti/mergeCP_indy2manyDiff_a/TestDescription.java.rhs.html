31  * DESCRIPTION
32  *     Test calls a boostrap and a target methods via InvokeDynamic call, monitoring that
33  *     a method in the debuggee class (Dummy0.redefineNow()) is called (monitoring is done
34  *     via MethodEntry event). After calling the target method, Dummy0 class is redefined
35  *     using RedefineClasses function to another Dummy0 class and PopFrame function
36  *     is called to reenter the method.
37  *     To verify logic of merging constant pools with regard to JSR 292, the original class has just
38  *     one invokedynamic call and the new Dummy0 has several invokedynamic calls with different arguments.
39  *     The test verifies that when class is redefined and frame is popped,
40  *     the new target method is executed and the site is relinked.
