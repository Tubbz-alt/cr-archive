32  * DESCRIPTION
33  *     Test calls a boostrap and a target methods via InvokeDynamic call, monitoring that
34  *     a method in the debuggee class (Dummy0.redefineNow()) is called (monitoring is done
35  *     via MethodEntry event). At this moment, Dummy0 class is redefined using RedefineClasses
36  *     function to Dummy1 class (in its classfile every occurence of &quot;Dummy1&quot; is replaced with
37  *     &quot;Dummy0&quot;) and PopFrame function is called to reenter the method.
38  *     The test verifies that:
39  *     - When class is redefined in bootstrap method frame, a new bootstrap method is called after PopFrame()
40  *     CR 6929027
