31  * DESCRIPTION
32  *    The test tries to detect a stale handle in MutableCallSite due to store-after-load reordering in
33  *    modern CPU.
34  *    Since MutableCallSite does not guarantee that changes by one thread are propagated to others,
35  *    the test may fail. We ignore such failure.
36  *    The current Oracle Hotspot JVM implementation uses an internal mutex when relinking a call site,
37  *    which serves as memory barrier between store and load in this test, so I never saw it failing.
