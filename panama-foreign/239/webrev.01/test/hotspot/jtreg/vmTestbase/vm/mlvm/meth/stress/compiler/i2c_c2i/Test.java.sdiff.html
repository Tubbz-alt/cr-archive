 32  * DESCRIPTION
 33  *     The test attempts to check MethodHandle i2c and c2i adapters by using sequences.
 34  *     Then it forces compilation of some of intermediate method handles. The test enables
 35  *     diagnostic printing of compilation and analyse it&#39;s own standard output
 36  *     to see if method is really has been compiled. When some subsequence is compiled,
 37  *     the test calls the whole sequence and forces decompilation (by using uncommon trap logic)
 38  *     of some smaller subsequence. This way both i2c and c2i adapters are created.
 39  *     The test compares result of calling the sequence of MHs with the results computed
 40  *     by the test and fails if the result is different.
 41  *     The test is a random one, it makes random sequences of MH and calls random subsequences.
 42  *     To facilitate reproducing test failures, it prints it&#39;s random seed, which can be fed
 43  *     to test when reproducing a problem.
 44  *     See vm.mlvm.meth.stress.java.sequences.Test for details on MH sequences.
