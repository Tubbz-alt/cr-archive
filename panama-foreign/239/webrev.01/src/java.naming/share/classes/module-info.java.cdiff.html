  /**
   * Defines the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API.
<span class="line-added">+  * &lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * Common standard JNDI environment properties that may be supported</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * by JNDI providers are defined and documented in</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * {@link javax.naming.Context}. Specific JNDI provider implementations</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * may also support other environment properties, which are specific</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * to their implementation.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * @implNote</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * The following implementation specific properties are supported by the</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * default LDAP Naming Service Provider implementation in the JDK:</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * &lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *     &lt;li&gt;{@code com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.timeout}:</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         &lt;br&gt;The value of this property is the string representation</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         of an integer representing the connection timeout in</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         milliseconds. If the LDAP provider cannot establish a</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         connection within that period, it aborts the connection attempt.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         The integer should be greater than zero. An integer less than</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         or equal to zero means to use the network protocol&#39;s (i.e., TCP&#39;s)</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         timeout value.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         &lt;br&gt; If this property is not specified, the default is to wait</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         for the connection to be established or until the underlying</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         network times out.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *     &lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *     &lt;li&gt;{@code com.sun.jndi.ldap.read.timeout}:</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         &lt;br&gt;The value of this property is the string representation</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         of an integer representing the read timeout in milliseconds</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         for LDAP operations. If the LDAP provider cannot get a LDAP</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         response within that period, it aborts the read attempt. The</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         integer should be greater than zero. An integer less than or</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         equal to zero means no read timeout is specified which is equivalent</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         to waiting for the response infinitely until it is received.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         &lt;br&gt;If this property is not specified, the default is to wait</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *         for the response until it is received.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  *     &lt;/li&gt;</span>
