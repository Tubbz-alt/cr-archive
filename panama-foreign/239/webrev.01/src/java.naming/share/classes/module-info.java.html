26 /**
27  * Defines the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API.
28  * &lt;p&gt;
29  * Common standard JNDI environment properties that may be supported
30  * by JNDI providers are defined and documented in
31  * {@link javax.naming.Context}. Specific JNDI provider implementations
32  * may also support other environment properties, which are specific
33  * to their implementation.
34  *
35  * @implNote
36  * The following implementation specific properties are supported by the
37  * default LDAP Naming Service Provider implementation in the JDK:
38  * &lt;ul&gt;
39  *     &lt;li&gt;{@code com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.timeout}:
40  *         &lt;br&gt;The value of this property is the string representation
41  *         of an integer representing the connection timeout in
42  *         milliseconds. If the LDAP provider cannot establish a
43  *         connection within that period, it aborts the connection attempt.
44  *         The integer should be greater than zero. An integer less than
45  *         or equal to zero means to use the network protocol&#39;s (i.e., TCP&#39;s)
46  *         timeout value.
47  *         &lt;br&gt; If this property is not specified, the default is to wait
48  *         for the connection to be established or until the underlying
49  *         network times out.
50  *     &lt;/li&gt;
51  *     &lt;li&gt;{@code com.sun.jndi.ldap.read.timeout}:
52  *         &lt;br&gt;The value of this property is the string representation
53  *         of an integer representing the read timeout in milliseconds
54  *         for LDAP operations. If the LDAP provider cannot get a LDAP
55  *         response within that period, it aborts the read attempt. The
56  *         integer should be greater than zero. An integer less than or
57  *         equal to zero means no read timeout is specified which is equivalent
58  *         to waiting for the response infinitely until it is received.
59  *         &lt;br&gt;If this property is not specified, the default is to wait
60  *         for the response until it is received.
61  *     &lt;/li&gt;
62  * &lt;/ul&gt;
