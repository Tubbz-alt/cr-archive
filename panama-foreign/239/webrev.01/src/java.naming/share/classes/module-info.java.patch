 /**
  * Defines the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API.
+ * <p>
+ * Common standard JNDI environment properties that may be supported
+ * by JNDI providers are defined and documented in
+ * {@link javax.naming.Context}. Specific JNDI provider implementations
+ * may also support other environment properties, which are specific
+ * to their implementation.
+ *
+ * @implNote
+ * The following implementation specific properties are supported by the
+ * default LDAP Naming Service Provider implementation in the JDK:
+ * <ul>
+ *     <li>{@code com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.timeout}:
+ *         <br>The value of this property is the string representation
+ *         of an integer representing the connection timeout in
+ *         milliseconds. If the LDAP provider cannot establish a
+ *         connection within that period, it aborts the connection attempt.
+ *         The integer should be greater than zero. An integer less than
+ *         or equal to zero means to use the network protocol's (i.e., TCP's)
+ *         timeout value.
+ *         <br> If this property is not specified, the default is to wait
+ *         for the connection to be established or until the underlying
+ *         network times out.
+ *     </li>
+ *     <li>{@code com.sun.jndi.ldap.read.timeout}:
+ *         <br>The value of this property is the string representation
+ *         of an integer representing the read timeout in milliseconds
+ *         for LDAP operations. If the LDAP provider cannot get a LDAP
+ *         response within that period, it aborts the read attempt. The
+ *         integer should be greater than zero. An integer less than or
+ *         equal to zero means no read timeout is specified which is equivalent
+ *         to waiting for the response infinitely until it is received.
+ *         <br>If this property is not specified, the default is to wait
+ *         for the response until it is received.
+ *     </li>
