2397 
2398     The do_marking_step(time_target_ms, ...) method is the building
2399     block of the parallel marking framework. It can be called in parallel
2400     with other invocations of do_marking_step() on different tasks
2401     (but only one per task, obviously) and concurrently with the
2402     mutator threads, or during remark, hence it eliminates the need
2403     for two versions of the code. When called during remark, it will
2404     pick up from where the task left off during the concurrent marking
2405     phase. Interestingly, tasks are also claimable during evacuation
2406     pauses too, since do_marking_step() ensures that it aborts before
2407     it needs to yield.
2408 
2409     The data structures that it uses to do marking work are the
2410     following:
2411 
2412       (1) Marking Bitmap. If there are gray objects that appear only
2413       on the bitmap (this happens either when dealing with an overflow
<span class="line-modified">2414       or when the initial marking phase has simply marked the roots</span>
2415       and didn&#39;t push them on the stack), then tasks claim heap
2416       regions whose bitmap they then scan to find gray objects. A
2417       global finger indicates where the end of the last claimed region
2418       is. A local finger indicates how far into the region a task has
2419       scanned. The two fingers are used to determine how to gray an
2420       object (i.e. whether simply marking it is OK, as it will be
2421       visited by a task in the future, or whether it needs to be also
2422       pushed on a stack).
2423 
2424       (2) Local Queue. The local queue of the task which is accessed
2425       reasonably efficiently by the task. Other tasks can steal from
2426       it when they run out of work. Throughout the marking phase, a
2427       task attempts to keep its local queue short but not totally
2428       empty, so that entries are available for stealing by other
2429       tasks. Only when there is no more work, a task will totally
2430       drain its local queue.
2431 
2432       (3) Global Mark Stack. This handles local queue overflow. During
2433       marking only sets of entries are moved between it and the local
2434       queues, as access to it requires a mutex and more fine-grain
