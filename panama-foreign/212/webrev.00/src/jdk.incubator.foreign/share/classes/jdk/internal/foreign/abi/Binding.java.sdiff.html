 31 /**
 32  * The binding operators defined in the Binding class can be combined into argument and return value processing &#39;recipes&#39;.
 33  *
 34  * The binding operators are interpreted using a stack-base interpreter. Operators can either consume operands from the
 35  * stack, or push them onto the stack.
 36  *
 37  * In the description of each binding we talk about &#39;boxing&#39; and &#39;unboxing&#39;.
 38  *  - Unboxing is the process of taking a Java value and decomposing it, and storing components into machine
 39  *    storage locations. As such, the binding interpreter stack starts with the Java value on it, and should end empty.
 40  *  - Boxing is the process of re-composing a Java value by pulling components from machine storage locations.
 41  *    If a MemorySegment is needed to store the result, one should be allocated using the ALLOCATE_BUFFER operator.
 42  *    The binding interpreter stack starts off empty, and ends with the value to be returned as the only value on it.
 43  * A binding operator can be interpreted differently based on whether we are boxing or unboxing a value. For example,
 44  * the CONVERT_ADDRESS operator &#39;unboxes&#39; a MemoryAddress to a long, but &#39;boxes&#39; a long to a MemoryAddress.
 45  *
 46  * Here are some examples of binding recipes derived from C declarations, and according to the Windows ABI (recipes are
 47  * ABI-specific). Note that each argument has it&#39;s own recipe, which is indicated by &#39;[number]:&#39; (though, the only
 48  * example that has multiple arguments is the one using varargs).
