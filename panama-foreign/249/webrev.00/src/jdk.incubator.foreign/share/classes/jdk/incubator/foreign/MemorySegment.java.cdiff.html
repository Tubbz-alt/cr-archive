      /**
       * Returns a new native memory segment with given base address and size; the returned segment has its own temporal
       * bounds, and can therefore be closed; closing such a segment can optionally result in calling an user-provided cleanup
       * action. This method can be very useful when interacting with custom native memory sources (e.g. custom allocators,
       * GPU memory, etc.), where an address to some underlying memory region is typically obtained from native code
