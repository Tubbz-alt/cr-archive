 43  * A memory segment models a contiguous region of memory. A memory segment is associated with both spatial
 44  * and temporal bounds. Spatial bounds ensure that memory access operations on a memory segment cannot affect a memory location
 45  * which falls &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment being accessed. Temporal checks ensure that memory access
 46  * operations on a segment cannot occur after a memory segment has been closed (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}).
 47  * &lt;p&gt;
 48  * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
 49  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 50  * instances of {@code MemorySegment} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 51  * be used for comparisons.
 52  * &lt;p&gt;
 53  * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemorySegment} directly.
 54  *
 55  * &lt;h2&gt;Constructing memory segments from different sources&lt;/h2&gt;
 56  *
 57  * There are multiple ways to obtain a memory segment. First, memory segments backed by off-heap memory can
 58  * be allocated using one of the many factory methods provided (see {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(MemoryLayout)},
 59  * {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)} and {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long, long)}). Memory segments obtained
 60  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;native memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 61  * &lt;p&gt;
 62  * It is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing heap-allocated Java array,
 63  * using one of the provided factory methods (e.g. {@link MemorySegment#ofArray(int[])}). Memory segments obtained
 64  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;array memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 65  * &lt;p&gt;
 66  * It is possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing Java byte buffer (see {@link ByteBuffer}),
 67  * using the factory method {@link MemorySegment#ofByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)}.
 68  * Memory segments obtained in this way are called &lt;em&gt;buffer memory segments&lt;/em&gt;. Note that buffer memory segments might
 69  * be backed by native memory (as in the case of native memory segments) or heap memory (as in the case of array memory segments),
 70  * depending on the characteristics of the byte buffer instance the segment is associated with. For instance, a buffer memory
 71  * segment obtained from a byte buffer created with the {@link ByteBuffer#allocateDirect(int)} method will be backed
 72  * by native memory.
 73  * &lt;p&gt;
 74  * Finally, it is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by a memory-mapped file using the factory method
 75  * {@link MemorySegment#mapFromPath(Path, long, FileChannel.MapMode)}. Such memory segments are called &lt;em&gt;mapped memory segments&lt;/em&gt;
 76  * (see {@link MappedMemorySegment}).
 77  *
 78  * &lt;h2&gt;Closing a memory segment&lt;/h2&gt;
 79  *
 80  * Memory segments are closed explicitly (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}). In general when a segment is closed, all off-heap
 81  * resources associated with it are released; this has different meanings depending on the kind of memory segment being
 82  * considered:
 83  * &lt;ul&gt;
 84  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a native memory segment results in &lt;em&gt;freeing&lt;/em&gt; the native memory associated with it&lt;/li&gt;
 85  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a mapped memory segment results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped&lt;/li&gt;
 86  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a buffer, or a heap segment does not have any side-effect, other than marking the segment
 87  *     as &lt;em&gt;not alive&lt;/em&gt; (see {@link MemorySegment#isAlive()}). Also, since the buffer and heap segments might keep
 88  *     strong references to the original buffer or array instance, it is the responsibility of clients to ensure that
 89  *     these segments are discarded in a timely manner, so as not to prevent garbage collection to reclaim the underlying
 90  *     objects.&lt;/li&gt;
 91  * &lt;/ul&gt;
 92  *
 93  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;thread-confinement&quot;&gt;Thread confinement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 94  *
 95  * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,
 96  * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
 97  * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
 98  * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
 99  * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
100  * &lt;p&gt;
101  * In some cases, it might be useful for multiple threads to process the contents of the same memory segment concurrently
102  * (e.g. in the case of parallel processing); while memory segments provide strong confinement guarantees, it is possible
103  * to obtain a {@link Spliterator} from a segment, which can be used to slice the segment and allow multiple thread to
104  * work in parallel on disjoint segment slices (this assumes that the access mode {@link #ACQUIRE} is set).
105  * For instance, the following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:
106  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
107 SequenceLayout SEQUENCE_LAYOUT = MemoryLayout.ofSequence(1024, MemoryLayouts.JAVA_INT);
108 VarHandle VH_int = SEQUENCE_LAYOUT.elementLayout().varHandle(int.class);
109 int sum = StreamSupport.stream(segment.spliterator(SEQUENCE_LAYOUT), true)
110             .mapToInt(segment -&gt; (int)VH_int.get(segment.baseAddress))
111             .sum();
112  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
113  *
114  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;access-modes&quot;&gt;Access modes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
115  *
116  * Memory segments supports zero or more &lt;em&gt;access modes&lt;/em&gt;. Supported access modes are {@link #READ},
117  * {@link #WRITE}, {@link #CLOSE} and {@link #ACQUIRE}. The set of access modes supported by a segment alters the
118  * set of operations that are supported by that segment. For instance, attempting to call {@link #close()} on
119  * a segment which does not support the {@link #CLOSE} access mode will result in an exception.
120  * &lt;p&gt;
121  * The set of supported access modes can only be made stricter (by supporting &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; access modes). This means
122  * that restricting the set of access modes supported by a segment before sharing it with other clients
123  * is generally a good practice if the creator of the segment wants to retain some control over how the segment
124  * is going to be accessed.
125  *
126  * &lt;h2&gt;Memory segment views&lt;/h2&gt;
127  *
128  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, it is possible to alter the set of supported access modes,
129  * by creating an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; view of a memory segment, as follows:
130  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
131 MemorySegment segment = ...
132 MemorySegment roSegment = segment.withAccessModes(segment.accessModes() &amp; ~WRITE);
133  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
134  * It is also possible to create views whose spatial bounds are stricter than the ones of the original segment
135  * (see {@link MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long)}).
136  * &lt;p&gt;
137  * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
138  * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
139  * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
140  * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as removing {@link #CLOSE}
141  * from the set of supported access modes, before sharing the view with another client.
142  * &lt;p&gt;
143  * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
144  * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
145  * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
146  * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory address from which they originated.
147  *
148  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
149  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
150  * {@link MappedMemorySegment} and other explicitly permitted subtypes.
151  *
152  * @implSpec
153  * Implementations of this interface are immutable and thread-safe.
