 The foreign-jextract branch depends on the foreign-abi branch, which in turn depends on the foreign-memaccess branch. As such, the foreign-jextract branch is the most complete of the three and therefore the default branch of this repository.
 
 Building notes
 ===================
-Jextract requires [LLVM 9.x](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) as a dependency. So, to build the foreign-jextract branch, the flag `--with-libclang=/path/to/llvm/root` must be supplied when generating a build configuration. Please see [doc/building.md](https://github.com/openjdk/panama-foreign/blob/foreign-jextract/doc/building.md) for general building instructions.
