 38  * This class manages the temporal bounds associated with a memory segment as well
 39  * as thread confinement.
 40  * A scope has a liveness bit, which is updated when the scope is closed
 41  * (this operation is triggered by {@link AbstractMemorySegmentImpl#close()}).
 42  * A scope may also have an associated &quot;owner&quot; thread that confines some operations to
 43  * associated owner thread such as {@link #close()} or {@link #dup(Thread)}.
 44  * Furthermore, a scope is either root scope ({@link #create(Object, Runnable) created}
 45  * when memory segment is allocated) or child scope ({@link #acquire() acquired} from root scope).
 46  * When a child scope is acquired from another child scope, it is actually acquired from
 47  * the root scope. There is only a single level of children. All child scopes are peers.
 48  * A child scope can be {@link #close() closed} at any time, but root scope can only
 49  * be closed after all its children have been closed, at which time any associated
 50  * cleanup action is executed (the associated memory segment is freed).
 51  * Besides thread-confined checked scopes, {@linkplain #createUnchecked(Thread, Object, Runnable)}
 52  * method may be used passing {@code null} as the &quot;owner&quot; thread to create a
 53  * scope that doesn&#39;t check for thread-confinement while its temporal bounds are
 54  * enforced reliably only under condition that thread that closes the scope is also
 55  * the single thread performing the checked access or there is an external synchronization
 56  * in place that prevents concurrent access and closing of the scope.
