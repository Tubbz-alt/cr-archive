 46  * A memory segment models a contiguous region of memory. A memory segment is associated with both spatial
 47  * and temporal bounds. Spatial bounds ensure that memory access operations on a memory segment cannot affect a memory location
 48  * which falls &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment being accessed. Temporal checks ensure that memory access
 49  * operations on a segment cannot occur after a memory segment has been closed (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}).
 50  * &lt;p&gt;
 51  * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
 52  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 53  * instances of {@code MemorySegment} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 54  * be used for comparisons.

 96  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;thread-confinement&quot;&gt;Thread confinement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 97  *
 98  * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,
 99  * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
100  * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
101  * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
102  * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
103  * &lt;p&gt;
104  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;serial thread confinement&lt;/em&gt;; that is, ownership of a memory segment can change (see
105  * {@link #withOwnerThread(Thread)}). This allows, for instance, for two threads {@code A} and {@code B} to share
106  * a segment in a controlled, cooperative and race-free fashion.
107  * &lt;p&gt;
108  * In some cases, it might be useful for multiple threads to process the contents of the same memory segment concurrently
109  * (e.g. in the case of parallel processing); while memory segments provide strong confinement guarantees, it is possible
110  * to obtain a {@link Spliterator} from a segment, which can be used to slice the segment and allow multiple thread to
111  * work in parallel on disjoint segment slices (this assumes that the access mode {@link #ACQUIRE} is set).
112  * For instance, the following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:
113  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code

114 SequenceLayout SEQUENCE_LAYOUT = MemoryLayout.ofSequence(1024, MemoryLayouts.JAVA_INT);
115 VarHandle VH_int = SEQUENCE_LAYOUT.elementLayout().varHandle(int.class);
<span class="line-modified">116 int sum = StreamSupport.stream(segment.spliterator(SEQUENCE_LAYOUT), true)</span>
<span class="line-modified">117             .mapToInt(segment -&gt; (int)VH_int.get(segment.baseAddress))</span>
118             .sum();
119  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
120  *
121  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;access-modes&quot;&gt;Access modes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
122  *
123  * Memory segments supports zero or more &lt;em&gt;access modes&lt;/em&gt;. Supported access modes are {@link #READ},
<span class="line-modified">124  * {@link #WRITE}, {@link #CLOSE} and {@link #ACQUIRE}. The set of access modes supported by a segment alters the</span>
125  * set of operations that are supported by that segment. For instance, attempting to call {@link #close()} on
126  * a segment which does not support the {@link #CLOSE} access mode will result in an exception.
127  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">128  * The set of supported access modes can only be made stricter (by supporting &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; access modes). This means</span>
129  * that restricting the set of access modes supported by a segment before sharing it with other clients
130  * is generally a good practice if the creator of the segment wants to retain some control over how the segment
131  * is going to be accessed.
132  *
133  * &lt;h2&gt;Memory segment views&lt;/h2&gt;
134  *
135  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, it is possible to alter the set of supported access modes,
136  * by creating an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; view of a memory segment, as follows:
137  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
138 MemorySegment segment = ...
139 MemorySegment roSegment = segment.withAccessModes(segment.accessModes() &amp; ~WRITE);
140  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
141  * It is also possible to create views whose spatial bounds are stricter than the ones of the original segment
142  * (see {@link MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long)}).
143  * &lt;p&gt;
144  * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
145  * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
146  * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
147  * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as removing {@link #CLOSE}
148  * from the set of supported access modes, before sharing the view with another client.
149  * &lt;p&gt;
150  * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
151  * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
152  * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
<span class="line-modified">153  * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory address from which they originated.</span>
154  *
155  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
156  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
157  * {@link MappedMemorySegment} and other explicitly permitted subtypes.
158  *
159  * @implSpec
160  * Implementations of this interface are immutable and thread-safe.

 95  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;thread-confinement&quot;&gt;Thread confinement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 96  *
 97  * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,
 98  * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
 99  * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
100  * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
101  * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
102  * &lt;p&gt;
103  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;serial thread confinement&lt;/em&gt;; that is, ownership of a memory segment can change (see
104  * {@link #withOwnerThread(Thread)}). This allows, for instance, for two threads {@code A} and {@code B} to share
105  * a segment in a controlled, cooperative and race-free fashion.
106  * &lt;p&gt;
107  * In some cases, it might be useful for multiple threads to process the contents of the same memory segment concurrently
108  * (e.g. in the case of parallel processing); while memory segments provide strong confinement guarantees, it is possible
109  * to obtain a {@link Spliterator} from a segment, which can be used to slice the segment and allow multiple thread to
110  * work in parallel on disjoint segment slices (this assumes that the access mode {@link #ACQUIRE} is set).
111  * For instance, the following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:
112  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
<span class="line-added">113 MemorySegment segment = ...</span>
114 SequenceLayout SEQUENCE_LAYOUT = MemoryLayout.ofSequence(1024, MemoryLayouts.JAVA_INT);
115 VarHandle VH_int = SEQUENCE_LAYOUT.elementLayout().varHandle(int.class);
<span class="line-modified">116 int sum = StreamSupport.stream(MemorySegment.spliterator(segment, SEQUENCE_LAYOUT), true)</span>
<span class="line-modified">117             .mapToInt(s -&gt; (int)VH_int.get(s.baseAddress()))</span>
118             .sum();
119  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
120  *
121  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;access-modes&quot;&gt;Access modes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
122  *
123  * Memory segments supports zero or more &lt;em&gt;access modes&lt;/em&gt;. Supported access modes are {@link #READ},
<span class="line-modified">124  * {@link #WRITE}, {@link #CLOSE}, {@link #ACQUIRE} and {@link #HANDOFF}. The set of access modes supported by a segment alters the</span>
125  * set of operations that are supported by that segment. For instance, attempting to call {@link #close()} on
126  * a segment which does not support the {@link #CLOSE} access mode will result in an exception.
127  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">128  * The set of supported access modes can only be made stricter (by supporting &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; access modes). This means</span>
129  * that restricting the set of access modes supported by a segment before sharing it with other clients
130  * is generally a good practice if the creator of the segment wants to retain some control over how the segment
131  * is going to be accessed.
132  *
133  * &lt;h2&gt;Memory segment views&lt;/h2&gt;
134  *
135  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, it is possible to alter the set of supported access modes,
136  * by creating an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; view of a memory segment, as follows:
137  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
138 MemorySegment segment = ...
139 MemorySegment roSegment = segment.withAccessModes(segment.accessModes() &amp; ~WRITE);
140  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
141  * It is also possible to create views whose spatial bounds are stricter than the ones of the original segment
142  * (see {@link MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long)}).
143  * &lt;p&gt;
144  * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
145  * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
146  * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
147  * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as removing {@link #CLOSE}
148  * from the set of supported access modes, before sharing the view with another client.
149  * &lt;p&gt;
150  * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
151  * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
152  * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
<span class="line-modified">153  * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory segment from which they originated.</span>
154  *
155  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
156  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
157  * {@link MappedMemorySegment} and other explicitly permitted subtypes.
