   * Here we create a var handle, namely {@code intHandle}, to manipulate values of the primitive type {@code int}, at
   * a given memory location. We then create a &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; memory segment, that is, a memory segment backed by
   * off-heap memory; the size of the segment is 40 bytes, enough to store 10 values of the primitive type {@code int}.
   * The segment is created inside a &lt;em&gt;try-with-resources&lt;/em&gt; construct: this idiom ensures that all the memory resources
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * associated with the segment will be released at the end of the block. Inside the try-with-resources block, we initialize</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * associated with the segment will be released at the end of the block, according to the semantics described in</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * Section {@jls 14.20.3} of &lt;cite&gt;The Java&amp;trade; Language Specification&lt;/cite&gt;. Inside the try-with-resources block, we initialize</span>
   * the contents of the memory segment; more specifically, if we view the memory segment as a set of 10 adjacent slots,
   * {@code s[i]}, where {@code 0 &lt;= i &lt; 10}, where the size of each slot is exactly 4 bytes, the initialization logic above will set each slot
   * so that {@code s[i] = i}, again where {@code 0 &lt;= i &lt; 10}.

   * The key abstractions introduced by this package are {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemorySegment} and {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemoryAddress}.

   * hierarchy enables description of &lt;em&gt;memory layouts&lt;/em&gt; and basic operations such as computing the size in bytes of a given
   * layout, obtain its alignment requirements, and so on. Memory layouts also provide an alternate, more abstract way, to produce
   * memory access var handles, e.g. using &lt;a href=&quot;MemoryLayout.html#layout-paths&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;layout paths&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

   *
   * This API provides strong safety guarantees when it comes to memory access. First, when dereferencing a memory segment using
   * a memory address, such an address is validated (upon access), to make sure that it does not point to a memory location
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * which resides &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment it refers to. We call this guarantee &lt;em&gt;spatial safety&lt;/em&gt;.</span>

<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * in other words, access to memory segments is bounds-checked, in the same way as array access is, as described in</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * Section {@jls 15.10.4} of &lt;cite&gt;The Java&amp;trade; Language Specification&lt;/cite&gt;.</span>
   * &lt;p&gt;
   * Since memory segments can be closed (see above), a memory address is also validated (upon access) to make sure that
   * the segment it belongs to has not been closed prematurely. We call this guarantee &lt;em&gt;temporal safety&lt;/em&gt;. Note that,
   * in the general case, guaranteeing temporal safety can be hard, as multiple threads could attempt to access and/or close
   * the same memory segment concurrently. The memory access API addresses this problem by imposing strong
