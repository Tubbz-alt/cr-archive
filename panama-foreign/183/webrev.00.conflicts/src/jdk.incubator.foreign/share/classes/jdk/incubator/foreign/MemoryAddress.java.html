 32  * A memory address models a reference into a memory location. Memory addresses are typically obtained using the
 33  * {@link MemorySegment#baseAddress()} method; such addresses are said to be &lt;em&gt;checked&lt;/em&gt;, and can be expressed
 34  * as &lt;em&gt;offsets&lt;/em&gt; into some underlying memory segment (see {@link #segment()} and {@link #segmentOffset()}).
 35  * Since checked memory addresses feature both spatial and temporal bounds, these addresses can &lt;em&gt;safely&lt;/em&gt; be
 36  * dereferenced using a memory access var handle (see {@link MemoryHandles}).
 37  * &lt;p&gt;
 38  * If an address does not have any associated segment, it is said to be &lt;em&gt;unchecked&lt;/em&gt;. Unchecked memory
 39  * addresses do not feature known spatial or temporal bounds; as such, attempting a memory dereference operation
 40  * using an unchecked memory address will result in a runtime exception. Unchecked addresses can be obtained
 41  * e.g. by calling the {@link #ofLong(long)} method.
 42  * &lt;p&gt;
 43  * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
 44  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 45  * instances of {@code MemoryAddress} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 46  * be used for comparisons.
 47  * &lt;p&gt;
 48  * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemoryAddress} directly.
 49  *
 50  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemoryAddress}
 51  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
 52  * explicitly permitted types.
 53  *
 54  * @implSpec
 55  * Implementations of this interface are immutable and thread-safe.
