   * This class manages the temporal bounds associated with a memory segment. A scope has a liveness bit, which is updated
   * when the scope is closed (this operation is triggered by {@link AbstractMemorySegmentImpl#close()}). Furthermore, a scope is
   * associated with an &lt;em&gt;atomic&lt;/em&gt; counter which can be incremented (upon calling the {@link #acquire()} method),
   * and is decremented (when a previously acquired segment is later closed).
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ =======</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * This class manages the temporal bounds associated with a memory segment as well</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * as thread confinement.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * A scope has a liveness bit, which is updated when the scope is closed</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * (this operation is triggered by {@link AbstractMemorySegmentImpl#close()}).</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * A scope may also have an associated &quot;owner&quot; thread that confines some operations to</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * associated owner thread such as {@link #close()} or {@link #dup(Thread)}.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * Furthermore, a scope is either root scope ({@link #create(Object, Runnable) created}</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * when memory segment is allocated) or child scope ({@link #acquire() acquired} from root scope).</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * When a child scope is acquired from another child scope, it is actually acquired from</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * the root scope. There is only a single level of children. All child scopes are peers.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * A child scope can be {@link #close() closed} at any time, but root scope can only</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * be closed after all its children have been closed, at which time any associated</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * cleanup action is executed (the associated memory segment is freed).</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * Besides thread-confined checked scopes, {@linkplain #createUnchecked(Thread, Object, Runnable)}</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * method may be used passing {@code null} as the &quot;owner&quot; thread to create a</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * scope that doesn&#39;t check for thread-confinement while its temporal bounds are</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * enforced reliably only under condition that thread that closes the scope is also</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * the single thread performing the checked access or there is an external synchronization</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * in place that prevents concurrent access and closing of the scope.</span>
