 32  * A mapped memory segment, that is, a memory segment backed by memory-mapped file.
 33  *
 34  * &lt;p&gt; Mapped memory segments are created via the {@link MemorySegment#mapFromPath(Path, long, FileChannel.MapMode)}.
 35 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
 36  * Mapped memory segments behave like ordinary segments, but provide additional capabilities to manipulate memory-mapped
 37  * memory regions, such as {@link #force()} and {@link #load()}.
 38 =======
 39  * Mapped memory segments behave like ordinary segments, but also provide additional capabilities that are specific to
 40  * mapped memory segments, such as {@link #force()} and {@link #load()}.
 41 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cd397502f19f72fa8a926f4508d3913c8ace9059
 42  * &lt;p&gt;
 43  * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
 44  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 45  * instances of {@code MemoryLayout} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 46  * be used for comparisons.
 47  * &lt;p&gt;
 48  * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MappedMemorySegment} directly.
 49  *
 50  * &lt;p&gt; The content of a mapped memory segment can change at any time, for example
 51  * if the content of the corresponding region of the mapped file is changed by
 52  * this (or another) program.  Whether or not such changes occur, and when they
 53  * occur, is operating-system dependent and therefore unspecified.
 54  *
 55  * All or part of a mapped memory segment may become
 56  * inaccessible at any time, for example if the backing mapped file is truncated.  An
 57  * attempt to access an inaccessible region of a mapped memory segment will not
 58  * change the segment&#39;s content and will cause an unspecified exception to be
 59  * thrown either at the time of the access or at some later time.  It is
 60  * therefore strongly recommended that appropriate precautions be taken to
 61  * avoid the manipulation of a mapped file by this (or another) program, except to read or write
 62  * the file&#39;s content.
 63  *
 64  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
 65  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
 66  * explicitly permitted subtypes.
