<span class="line-modified">!  * &lt;p&gt; Classes to support low-level, safe and efficient memory access. For example:</span>
   *
   * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
<span class="line-modified">! static final VarHandle intHandle = MemoryHandles.varHandle(int.class, ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN);</span>
  
  try (MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(10 * 4)) {
     MemoryAddress base = segment.baseAddress();
     for (long i = 0 ; i &lt; 10 ; i++) {
       intHandle.set(base.addOffset(i * 4), (int)i);
     }
   }
   * }&lt;/pre&gt;
   *
   * Here we create a var handle, namely {@code intHandle}, to manipulate values of the primitive type {@code int}, at
<span class="line-modified">!  * a given memory location. We then create a &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; memory segment, that is, a memory segment backed by</span>
   * off-heap memory; the size of the segment is 40 bytes, enough to store 10 values of the primitive type {@code int}.
   * The segment is created inside a &lt;em&gt;try-with-resources&lt;/em&gt; construct: this idiom ensures that all the memory resources
   * associated with the segment will be released at the end of the block, according to the semantics described in
   * Section {@jls 14.20.3} of &lt;cite&gt;The Java&amp;trade; Language Specification&lt;/cite&gt;. Inside the try-with-resources block, we initialize
   * the contents of the memory segment; more specifically, if we view the memory segment as a set of 10 adjacent slots,
   * {@code s[i]}, where {@code 0 &lt;= i &lt; 10}, where the size of each slot is exactly 4 bytes, the initialization logic above will set each slot
   * so that {@code s[i] = i}, again where {@code 0 &lt;= i &lt; 10}.

<span class="line-added">+  *</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * For example, to allocate an off-heap memory region big enough to hold 10 values of the primitive type {@code int}, and fill it values</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * ranging from {@code 0} to {@code 9}, we can use the following code:</span>
   *
   * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
<span class="line-modified">! static final VarHandle intHandle = MemoryHandles.varHandle(int.class, ByteOrder.nativeOrder());</span>

     MemoryAddress base = segment.baseAddress();
     for (long i = 0 ; i &lt; 10 ; i++) {
       intHandle.set(base.addOffset(i * 4), (int)i);
     }
   }
   * }&lt;/pre&gt;
   *
   * Here we create a var handle, namely {@code intHandle}, to manipulate values of the primitive type {@code int}, at
<span class="line-modified">!  * a given memory location. Also, {@code intHandle} is stored in a {@code static} and {@code final} field, to achieve</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * better performances and allow for inlining of the memory access operation through the {@link java.lang.invoke.VarHandle}</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * instance. We then create a &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; memory segment, that is, a memory segment backed by</span>
   * off-heap memory; the size of the segment is 40 bytes, enough to store 10 values of the primitive type {@code int}.
