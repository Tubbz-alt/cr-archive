<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * &lt;p&gt; Classes to support low-level, safe and efficient memory access. For example:</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * &lt;p&gt; Classes to support low-level, safe and efficient memory access.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * &lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * The key abstractions introduced by this package are {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemorySegment} and {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemoryAddress}.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * The first models a contiguous memory region, which can reside either inside or outside the Java heap; the latter models an address - which can</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * sometimes be expressed as an offset into a given segment. A memory address represents the main access coordinate of a memory access var handle, which can be obtained</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * using the combinator methods defined in the {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemoryHandles} class. Finally, the {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemoryLayout} class</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * hierarchy enables description of &lt;em&gt;memory layouts&lt;/em&gt; and basic operations such as computing the size in bytes of a given</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * layout, obtain its alignment requirements, and so on. Memory layouts also provide an alternate, more abstract way, to produce</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * memory access var handles, e.g. using &lt;a href=&quot;MemoryLayout.html#layout-paths&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;layout paths&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  *</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * For example, to allocate an off-heap memory region big enough to hold 10 values of the primitive type {@code int}, and fill it with values</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * ranging from {@code 0} to {@code 9}, we can use the following code:</span>
   *
   * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- static final VarHandle intHandle = MemoryHandles.varHandle(int.class, ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN);</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ static final VarHandle intHandle = MemoryHandles.varHandle(int.class, ByteOrder.nativeOrder());</span>
  
  try (MemorySegment segment = MemorySegment.allocateNative(10 * 4)) {
     MemoryAddress base = segment.baseAddress();
     for (long i = 0 ; i &lt; 10 ; i++) {
       intHandle.set(base.addOffset(i * 4), (int)i);
     }
   }
   * }&lt;/pre&gt;
   *
   * Here we create a var handle, namely {@code intHandle}, to manipulate values of the primitive type {@code int}, at
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * a given memory location. We then create a &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; memory segment, that is, a memory segment backed by</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * a given memory location. Also, {@code intHandle} is stored in a {@code static} and {@code final} field, to achieve</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * better performances and allow for inlining of the memory access operation through the {@link java.lang.invoke.VarHandle}</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * instance. We then create a &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; memory segment, that is, a memory segment backed by</span>
   * off-heap memory; the size of the segment is 40 bytes, enough to store 10 values of the primitive type {@code int}.
   * The segment is created inside a &lt;em&gt;try-with-resources&lt;/em&gt; construct: this idiom ensures that all the memory resources
   * associated with the segment will be released at the end of the block, according to the semantics described in
   * Section {@jls 14.20.3} of &lt;cite&gt;The Java&amp;trade; Language Specification&lt;/cite&gt;. Inside the try-with-resources block, we initialize
   * the contents of the memory segment; more specifically, if we view the memory segment as a set of 10 adjacent slots,
   * {@code s[i]}, where {@code 0 &lt;= i &lt; 10}, where the size of each slot is exactly 4 bytes, the initialization logic above will set each slot
   * so that {@code s[i] = i}, again where {@code 0 &lt;= i &lt; 10}.
   *

<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * The first models a contiguous memory region, which can reside either inside or outside the Java heap; the latter models an address - which can</span>

<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  *</span>
   * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;deallocation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Deterministic deallocation&lt;/h2&gt;
   *
   * When writing code that manipulates memory segments, especially if backed by memory which resides outside the Java heap, it is
   * crucial that the resources associated with a memory segment are released when the segment is no longer in use, by calling the {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemorySegment#close()}
   * method either explicitly, or implicitly, by relying on try-with-resources construct (as demonstrated in the example above).
