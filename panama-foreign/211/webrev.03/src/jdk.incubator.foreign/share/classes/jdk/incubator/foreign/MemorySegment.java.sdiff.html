 45  * A memory segment models a contiguous region of memory. A memory segment is associated with both spatial
 46  * and temporal bounds. Spatial bounds ensure that memory access operations on a memory segment cannot affect a memory location
<span class="line-modified"> 47  * which falls &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment being accessed. Temporal checks ensure that memory access</span>
 48  * operations on a segment cannot occur after a memory segment has been closed (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}).
 49  * &lt;p&gt;
 50  * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
 51  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 52  * instances of {@code MemorySegment} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 53  * be used for comparisons.
 54  * &lt;p&gt;
 55  * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemorySegment} directly.
 56  *
 57  * &lt;h2&gt;Constructing memory segments from different sources&lt;/h2&gt;
 58  *
 59  * There are multiple ways to obtain a memory segment. First, memory segments backed by off-heap memory can
 60  * be allocated using one of the many factory methods provided (see {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(MemoryLayout)},
 61  * {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)} and {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long, long)}). Memory segments obtained
 62  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;native memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 63  * &lt;p&gt;
 64  * It is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing heap-allocated Java array,
 65  * using one of the provided factory methods (e.g. {@link MemorySegment#ofArray(int[])}). Memory segments obtained
 66  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;array memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 67  * &lt;p&gt;
</pre>

 85  * at a time - e.g. so as to prevent concurrent modifications of the contents of an array, or buffer segment.
 86  *
 87  * &lt;h2&gt;Closing a memory segment&lt;/h2&gt;
 88  *
 89  * Memory segments are closed explicitly (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}). When a segment is closed, it is no longer
 90  * &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt; (see {@link #isAlive()}, and subsequent operation on the segment (or on any {@link MemoryAddress} instance
 91  * derived from it) will fail with {@link IllegalStateException}.
 92  * &lt;p&gt;
 93  * Closing a segment might trigger the releasing of the underlying memory resources associated with said segment, depending on
 94  * the kind of memory segment being considered:
 95  * &lt;ul&gt;
 96  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a native memory segment results in &lt;em&gt;freeing&lt;/em&gt; the native memory associated with it&lt;/li&gt;
 97  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a mapped memory segment results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped&lt;/li&gt;
 98  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a buffer, or a heap segment does not have any side-effect, other than marking the segment
 99  *     as &lt;em&gt;not alive&lt;/em&gt; (see {@link MemorySegment#isAlive()}). Also, since the buffer and heap segments might keep
100  *     strong references to the original buffer or array instance, it is the responsibility of clients to ensure that
101  *     these segments are discarded in a timely manner, so as not to prevent garbage collection to reclaim the underlying
102  *     objects.&lt;/li&gt;
103  * &lt;/ul&gt;
104  *
<span class="line-removed">105  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;thread-confinement&quot;&gt;Thread confinement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
<span class="line-removed">106  *</span>
<span class="line-removed">107  * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,</span>
<span class="line-removed">108  * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed</span>
<span class="line-removed">109  * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with</span>
<span class="line-removed">110  * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the</span>
<span class="line-removed">111  * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.</span>
<span class="line-removed">112  * &lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="line-removed">113  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;serial thread confinement&lt;/em&gt;; that is, ownership of a memory segment can change (see</span>
<span class="line-removed">114  * {@link #withOwnerThread(Thread)}). This allows, for instance, for two threads {@code A} and {@code B} to share</span>
<span class="line-removed">115  * a segment in a controlled, cooperative and race-free fashion.</span>
<span class="line-removed">116  * &lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="line-removed">117  * In some cases, it might be useful for multiple threads to process the contents of the same memory segment concurrently</span>
<span class="line-removed">118  * (e.g. in the case of parallel processing); while memory segments provide strong confinement guarantees, it is possible</span>
<span class="line-removed">119  * to obtain a {@link Spliterator} from a segment, which can be used to slice the segment and allow multiple thread to</span>
<span class="line-removed">120  * work in parallel on disjoint segment slices (this assumes that the access mode {@link #ACQUIRE} is set).</span>
<span class="line-removed">121  * For instance, the following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:</span>
<span class="line-removed">122  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code</span>
<span class="line-removed">123 MemorySegment segment = ...</span>
<span class="line-removed">124 SequenceLayout SEQUENCE_LAYOUT = MemoryLayout.ofSequence(1024, MemoryLayouts.JAVA_INT);</span>
<span class="line-removed">125 VarHandle VH_int = SEQUENCE_LAYOUT.elementLayout().varHandle(int.class);</span>
<span class="line-removed">126 int sum = StreamSupport.stream(MemorySegment.spliterator(segment, SEQUENCE_LAYOUT), true)</span>
<span class="line-removed">127             .mapToInt(s -&gt; (int)VH_int.get(s.baseAddress()))</span>
<span class="line-removed">128             .sum();</span>
<span class="line-removed">129  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</span>

131  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;access-modes&quot;&gt;Access modes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
132  *
133  * Memory segments supports zero or more &lt;em&gt;access modes&lt;/em&gt;. Supported access modes are {@link #READ},
134  * {@link #WRITE}, {@link #CLOSE}, {@link #ACQUIRE} and {@link #HANDOFF}. The set of access modes supported by a segment alters the
135  * set of operations that are supported by that segment. For instance, attempting to call {@link #close()} on
136  * a segment which does not support the {@link #CLOSE} access mode will result in an exception.
137  * &lt;p&gt;
138  * The set of supported access modes can only be made stricter (by supporting &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; access modes). This means
139  * that restricting the set of access modes supported by a segment before sharing it with other clients
140  * is generally a good practice if the creator of the segment wants to retain some control over how the segment
141  * is going to be accessed.
142  *
143  * &lt;h2&gt;Memory segment views&lt;/h2&gt;
144  *
145  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, it is possible to alter the set of supported access modes,
146  * by creating an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; view of a memory segment, as follows:
147  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
148 MemorySegment segment = ...
149 MemorySegment roSegment = segment.withAccessModes(segment.accessModes() &amp; ~WRITE);
150  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
151  * It is also possible to create views whose spatial bounds are stricter than the ones of the original segment
152  * (see {@link MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long)}).
153  * &lt;p&gt;
154  * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
155  * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
156  * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
157  * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as removing {@link #CLOSE}
158  * from the set of supported access modes, before sharing the view with another client.
159  * &lt;p&gt;
160  * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
161  * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
162  * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
163  * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory segment from which they originated.
164  *


























165  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
166  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
167  * {@link MappedMemorySegment} and other explicitly permitted subtypes.
