<span class="line-modified">!  * Memory segments are closed explicitly (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}). In general when a segment is closed, all off-heap</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * resources associated with it are released; this has different meanings depending on the kind of memory segment being</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * considered:</span>
   * &lt;ul&gt;
   *     &lt;li&gt;closing a native memory segment results in &lt;em&gt;freeing&lt;/em&gt; the native memory associated with it&lt;/li&gt;
   *     &lt;li&gt;closing a mapped memory segment results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped&lt;/li&gt;
   *     &lt;li&gt;closing a buffer, or a heap segment does not have any side-effect, other than marking the segment
   *     as &lt;em&gt;not alive&lt;/em&gt; (see {@link MemorySegment#isAlive()}). Also, since the buffer and heap segments might keep
   *     strong references to the original buffer or array instance, it is the responsibility of clients to ensure that
   *     these segments are discarded in a timely manner, so as not to prevent garbage collection to reclaim the underlying
   *     objects.&lt;/li&gt;

<span class="line-removed">-  * work in parallel on disjoint segment slices (this assumes that the access mode {@link #ACQUIRE} is set).</span>
<span class="line-removed">-  * For instance, the following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:</span>

<span class="line-added">+  * of the {@link ByteBuffer} API) by other clients. As a result, while sharing array or buffer segments is possible,</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * it is strongly advised that clients wishing to do so take extra precautions to make sure that the underlying memory sources</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * associated with such segments remain inaccessible, and that said memory sources are never aliased by more than one segment</span>
