41   // object. However the lock could have already been inflated. But it

47   // displaced word) from a location in an interpreter frame to a
48   // new location in a compiled frame.  &quot;this&quot; refers to the source
49   // BasicLock in the interpreter frame.  &quot;dest&quot; refers to the destination
50   // BasicLock in the new compiled frame.  We *always* inflate in move_to()
51   // when the object is locked using &quot;this&quot; lightweight monitor.
52   //
53   // The always-Inflate policy works properly, but it depends on the
54   // inflated fast-path operations in fast_lock and fast_unlock to avoid
55   // performance problems. See x86/macroAssembler_x86.cpp: fast_lock()
56   // and fast_unlock() for examples.

58   // Note that there is a way to safely swing the object&#39;s markword from
59   // one stack location to another.  This avoids inflation.  Obviously,
60   // we need to ensure that both locations refer to the current thread&#39;s stack.
61   // There are some subtle concurrency issues, however, and since the benefit is
62   // is small (given the support for inflated fast-path locking in the fast_lock, etc)
