 22 The Churn tests are a series of small programs designed to
 23 simply churn memory over, mixing in calls to GC and Finalization.
 24 They are all basically the same program with permutations.
 25 Each program contains:
 26 
 27 LocalRandom class -- used to isloate calls to random generator
 28         for reproducibility
 29 
 30 MemoryObject class -- simply allocated and reclaimed. contains
 31         a byte array
 32 
 33 Churn class -- entry point. Allocates threads and counts objects.
 34         When loop is done, sets Semaphore to signal threads to cease
 35 
 36 ThreadObject class -- allocates and deallocates (by assignment)
 37         MemoryObjects
 38 
 39 SemaphoreObject class -- static class for signalling threads when
 40         to stop running. Perhap poorly named.
 41 
 42 CommandLine class -- parses command line args. Static class.
 43 --------------------------
 44 Usage:
 45 
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified"> 46 java Churn [-l numberOfLoops] [-t numberOfThreads] [-a sizeOfArray] [-m multiplier] [-f &lt;run forever&gt;]</span>
 47 
 48 NOTE: the options can be passed in any order
 49 
 50 
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a>

 51 numberOfLoops is the number of iterations a test will go through.
 52 This defaults to 2000
 53 
 54 numberOfThreads is the number of threads activating and deactivating
 55 MemoryObjects. This deaults to 2.
 56 
 57 sizeOfArray is the number of MemoryObjects each thread manipulates.
 58 This defaults to 1024.
 59 
 60 multiplier is a value used to determine how much memory each MemoryObject
 61 holds. It defaults to 10.
 62 
 63 The tests can be configured to run forever by passing -f on the
 64 command line. This is useful for continued stress testing outside
 65 of a test harness.
 66 -----------------------------
 67 The total amount of needed memory is approximately
 68 numberOfThreads * (sizeOfArray * sizeOfArray) * (multiplier / 2) bytes
 69 
 70 The default is about 10 Megs needed, not couting garbage collection
 71 overhead.  Garbage collection doubles the memory requirements for
 72 programs that run out of heap space, so the the true default size
 73 is 20 Megs.
 74 
 75 
 76 Testname        What it does
 77 -------------   ---------------------------------------------------------
 78 Churn1          Simply creates new MemObjects. No finalizers. No user
 79                 calls to System.gc(). Count of objects simply grows
 80                 since no method ever decreases the count -- object count
 81                 equals total objects ever allocated. Memory used is
 82                 approx = (object count) * (array size) * (multiplier) / 2
 83 
 84 Churn2          Same as Churn1, but adds a call to System.gc() every loop.
 85                 Object Count should simply increase. About half the time,
 86                 this test will hang before the 100th loop. About 10% of
 87                 the time this test will SEG FAULT with either a BUS ERROR
 88                 or ACCESS VIOLATION
 89 
 90 Churn3          Same as Churn1, but the MemoryObject class has a
 91                 finalize() method on it. The method is empty. The objecty
 92                 count should continue to rise. However, this program
 93                 runs out of memory after around 35 loops. The threads
 94                 dies from OutOfMemoryErrors. It looks as if the
 95                 finalizers are not called fast enough during GC, so
 96                 enough memory cannot be freed.
 97                 Additionally, about 10% of the time, this program SEGFAULTS
 98 
 99 Churn3a         Same as Churn3, but with an explicit call to
100                 System.runFinalization() in each loop.
101                 Occasionally, this test will run out of memory
102                 early on for one or more of the threads.
103                 Also, this test sometimes hangs, even if one or
104                 all of the ThreadObjects have died.
105                 Even if no threads die, and it doesn&#39;t hang, this
106                 program will still die with:
107                         java.lang.NullPointerException
108                                 at java.lang.String.indexOf(String.java)
109                                 at Churn3a.main(Churn3a.java:71)
110                 which contains only a call to join()
111 
112 
113 
114 Churn4          Same as Churn3, but with code in the finalize method
115                 which would decrement a *static* field in the class.
116                 This test runs out of memory much more quickly, something
117                 like after 3 or 4 loops.
