32  * DESCRIPTION
33  *     The test checks that Garbage Collector correctly works with
34  *     SoftReferences. It also checks that no unexpected exceptions and errors
35  *     are thrown or the JVM is not crashed.
36  *     The test starts a number of threads. Each thread run tests for some time
37  *     or serveral iterations.  See javadoc StressOptions for configuration.
38  *     First of all each thread defines what type to check (there are 10 types
39  *     totally). As soon as the type is defined, a SoftRefence is created that
40  *     refers to an array of tested type and is registered with in a queue. A
41  *     SoftRefence for NonbranchyTree class does not refer to an array, but to
42  *     instances of the class.
43  *     After that a thread performs next checks for the reference:
44  *         1. The reference is in queue after GC is provoked with
45  *            Algorithms.eatMemory() method (a single thread eats the memory).
46  *         2. queue.remove() returns reference from the queue.
47  *         3. queue.poll() returns null.
48  *         4. reference.clear() does not throw any exception.
49  *     The test extends ThreadedGCTest and implements GarbageProducerAware and
50  *     MemoryStrategyAware interfaces. The corresponding javadoc documentation
51  *     for additional test configuration.
