 33  * DESCRIPTION
 34  * Test the possible interaction of external hashing and locking on object
 35  * headers.
 36  * The approach is to nearly simultaneously lock/hash a relatively small group
 37  * of objects. We do this repeatedly (munging), recording all hash values
 38  * collected therein.
 39  * After doing this for a large number of groups, we force a garbage collection,
 40  * which would change the hashCode of an object if it hasn&#39;t previously been
 41  * hashed. In our case, we _know_ what the previous hashcode was, so we can
 42  * recalculate all of their hashes and compare with the original value.
 43  * If any of the hashCodes hash changed, we know we have a problem.
 44  *
 45  * COMMENTS
 46  * This test was ported from JRockit test suite.
