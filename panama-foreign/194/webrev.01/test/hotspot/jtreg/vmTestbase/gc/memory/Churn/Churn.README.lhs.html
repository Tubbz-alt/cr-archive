 22 The Churn tests are a series of small programs designed to
 23 simply churn memory over, mixing in calls to GC and Finalization.
 24 They are all basically the same program with permutations.
 25 Each program contains:
 26 
 27 LocalRandom class -- used to isloate calls to random generator
 28         for reproducibility
 29 
 30 MemoryObject class -- simply allocated and reclaimed. contains
 31         a byte array
 32 
 33 Churn class -- entry point. Allocates threads and counts objects.
 34         When loop is done, sets Semaphore to signal threads to cease
 35 
 36 ThreadObject class -- allocates and deallocates (by assignment)
 37         MemoryObjects
 38 
 39 SemaphoreObject class -- static class for signalling threads when
 40         to stop running. Perhap poorly named.
 41 
 42 CommandLine class -- parses command line args. Static class.
 43 --------------------------
 44 Usage:
 45 
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified"> 46 java Churn [-l numberOfLoops] [-t numberOfThreads] [-a sizeOfArray] [-m multiplier] [-f &lt;run forever&gt;] [-s seed]</span>
 47 
 48 NOTE: the options can be passed in any order
 49 
 50 
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a><span class="line-removed"> 51 seed is the seed for the LocalRandom pseudo-random generator</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 52 </span>
 53 numberOfLoops is the number of iterations a test will go through.
 54 This defaults to 2000
 55 
 56 numberOfThreads is the number of threads activating and deactivating
 57 MemoryObjects. This deaults to 2.
 58 
 59 sizeOfArray is the number of MemoryObjects each thread manipulates.
 60 This defaults to 1024.
 61 
 62 multiplier is a value used to determine how much memory each MemoryObject
 63 holds. It defaults to 10.
 64 
 65 The tests can be configured to run forever by passing -f on the
 66 command line. This is useful for continued stress testing outside
 67 of a test harness.
 68 -----------------------------
 69 The total amount of needed memory is approximately
 70 numberOfThreads * (sizeOfArray * sizeOfArray) * (multiplier / 2) bytes
 71 
 72 The default is about 10 Megs needed, not couting garbage collection
 73 overhead.  Garbage collection doubles the memory requirements for
 74 programs that run out of heap space, so the the true default size
 75 is 20 Megs.
 76 
 77 
 78 Testname        What it does
 79 -------------   ---------------------------------------------------------
 80 Churn1          Simply creates new MemObjects. No finalizers. No user
 81                 calls to System.gc(). Count of objects simply grows
 82                 since no method ever decreases the count -- object count
 83                 equals total objects ever allocated. Memory used is
 84                 approx = (object count) * (array size) * (multiplier) / 2
 85 
 86 Churn2          Same as Churn1, but adds a call to System.gc() every loop.
 87                 Object Count should simply increase. About half the time,
 88                 this test will hang before the 100th loop. About 10% of
 89                 the time this test will SEG FAULT with either a BUS ERROR
 90                 or ACCESS VIOLATION
 91 
 92 Churn3          Same as Churn1, but the MemoryObject class has a
 93                 finalize() method on it. The method is empty. The objecty
 94                 count should continue to rise. However, this program
 95                 runs out of memory after around 35 loops. The threads
 96                 dies from OutOfMemoryErrors. It looks as if the
 97                 finalizers are not called fast enough during GC, so
 98                 enough memory cannot be freed.
 99                 Additionally, about 10% of the time, this program SEGFAULTS
100 
101 Churn3a         Same as Churn3, but with an explicit call to
102                 System.runFinalization() in each loop.
103                 Occasionally, this test will run out of memory
104                 early on for one or more of the threads.
105                 Also, this test sometimes hangs, even if one or
106                 all of the ThreadObjects have died.
107                 Even if no threads die, and it doesn&#39;t hang, this
108                 program will still die with:
109                         java.lang.NullPointerException
110                                 at java.lang.String.indexOf(String.java)
111                                 at Churn3a.main(Churn3a.java:71)
112                 which contains only a call to join()
113 
114 
115 
116 Churn4          Same as Churn3, but with code in the finalize method
117                 which would decrement a *static* field in the class.
118                 This test runs out of memory much more quickly, something
119                 like after 3 or 4 loops.
