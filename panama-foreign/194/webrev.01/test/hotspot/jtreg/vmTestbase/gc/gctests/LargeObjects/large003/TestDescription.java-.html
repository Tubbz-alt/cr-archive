32  * DESCRIPTION
33  *     The test checks that Garbage Collector correctly does not throw any
34  *     unexpected exceptions/errors while allocating large objects (classes
35  *     that have more than 65535 fields and classes that have less than 65535
36  *     fields). 65535 of fields is a limitation for JVM (see JVM specification
37  *     Second edition 4.10).
38  *     Since it is impossible to create one class with about 65535 of fields
39  *     (javac cannot compile it), a child class extends a parent class, so the
40  *     fields are devided into two subsets. However, the child class still has
41  *     about 65535 of fields.
42  *     The test starts a number of threads. This number is either set in *.cfg
43  *     file or is calculated by the test itself based on the machine (see
44  *     nsk.share.gc.Algorithms.getThreadsCount() method). As soon as all threads
45  *     are started, each thread begins its checking.
46  *     There are 13 classes to be loaded by each thread. These classes are
47  *     generated by nsk.share.gc.Generator (see its javadoc for more details).
48  *     Each class has a huge number of fields, but this number is less than the JVM
49  *     limitation.
50  *     The test loads the classes with nsk.share.gc.GCClassUnloader class that
51  *     extends nsk.share.ClassUnloader and has a bit different algorith of eating
52  *     heap. As soon as a class is loaded, the test creates an instance of
53  *     it - allocates an object of that type. Then it drops references to the
54  *     class and to the instance and tries to unload the class. The test does not
55  *     expect any exceptions to be thrown.
56  *     Additionaly to original tests this test create object with large count of
57  *     field which contains also a reference to other such object wich also
58  *     contains same reference and so on. The deep of such aggregation is controlled
59  *     by the test. These references are verified after GC.
