32  * DESCRIPTION
33  *     The test checks that Garbage Collector correctly does not throw any
34  *     unexpected exceptions/errors while allocating large objects (classes
35  *     that have more than 65535 fields and classes that have less than 65535
36  *     fields). 65535 of fields is a limitation for JVM (see JVM specification
37  *     Second edition 4.10).
38  *     Since it is impossible to create one class with about 65535 of fields
39  *     (javac cannot compile it), a child class extends a parent class, so the
40  *     fields are devided into two subsets. However, the child class still has
41  *     about 65535 of fields.
42  *     The test starts a number of threads. This number is either set in *.cfg
43  *     file or is calculated by the test itself based on the machine (see
44  *     nsk.share.gc.Algorithms.getThreadsCount() method). As soon as all threads
45  *     are started, each thread begins its checking.
46  *     There are 13 classes to be loaded by each thread. These classes are
47  *     generated by nsk.share.gc.Generator (see its javadoc for more details).
