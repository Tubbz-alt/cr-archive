 31  * DESCRIPTION
 32  *     The test checks that Garbage Collector correctly works with
 33  *     WeakReferences. It also checks that no unexpected exceptions and errors
 34  *     are thrown or the JVM is not crashed.
 35  *     The test starts a number of threads. Each thread run tests for some time
 36  *     or serveral iterations.  See javadoc StressOptions for configuration.
 37  *     First of all each test defines what type to check (there are 10 types
 38  *     totally). As soon as the type is defined, a WeakReference is created that
 39  *     refers to an array of tested type and is registered with in a queue. A
 40  *     WeakReference for NonbranchyTree class does not refer to an array, but to
 41  *     instances of the class.
 42  *     After that a thread performs next checks for the reference:
 43  *         1. The reference is in queue after GC is provoked with
 44  *            Algorithms.eatMemory() method (a single thread eats the memory).
 45  *         2. queue.remove() returns reference from the queue.
 46  *         3. queue.poll() returns null.
