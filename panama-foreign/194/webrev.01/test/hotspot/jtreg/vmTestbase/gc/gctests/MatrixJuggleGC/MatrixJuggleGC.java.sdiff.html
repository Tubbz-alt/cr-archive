 35  * This test creates a 2 dimensional matrix of (100X100)10,000 elements.
 36  * Each element in this matrix houses the address of a &quot;Cell&quot; that
 37  * occupies about 100 bytes. The total memory occupied by this structure is
 38  * about 1M.
 39  * Once this structure, has been built, 5 threads are let loose that
 40  * randomly choose an element in this matrix and set its contents to null
 41  * effectively creating 100bytes of garbage. The threads continue to act
 42  * until all 5 threads combined have &quot;nulled out&quot; half the cells in the matrix.
 43  * At this point, 5 refiller threads proceed to refill the empty
 44  * matrix elements with new cells.
 45  * Once the refiller threads have refilled all the empty matrix elements
 46  * with new cells, the cycle begins all over again with the 5 &quot;emptier&quot;
