 36  * a scope is either root scope ({@link #create(Object, Runnable) created} when memory segment is allocated) or child scope
 37  * ({@link #acquire() acquired} from root scope). When a child scope is acquired from another child scope, it is actually
 38  * acquired from the root scope. There is only a single level of children. All child scopes are peers.
 39  * A child scope can be {@link #close() closed} at any time, but root scope can only be closed after all its children
 40  * have been closed, at which time any associated cleanup action is executed (the associated memory segment is freed).
