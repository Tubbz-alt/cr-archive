 39  * acquired from the root scope. There is only a single level of children. All child scopes are peers.
 40  * A child scope can be {@link #close() closed} at any time, but root scope can only be closed after all its children
 41  * have been closed, at which time any associated cleanup action is executed (the associated memory segment is freed).
