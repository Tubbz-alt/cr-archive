   * of the native scope is known statically. If an application knows before-hand how much memory it needs to allocate the values it needs,
   * using a &lt;em&gt;bounded&lt;/em&gt; native scope will typically provide better performances than independently allocating the memory
   * for each value (e.g. using {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)}), or using an &lt;em&gt;unbounded&lt;/em&gt; native scope.
   * For this reason, using a bounded native scope is recommended in cases where programs might need to emulate native stack allocation.
