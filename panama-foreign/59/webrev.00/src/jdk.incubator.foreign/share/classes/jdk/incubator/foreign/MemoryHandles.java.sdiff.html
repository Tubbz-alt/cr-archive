 38  * This class defines several factory methods for constructing and combining memory access var handles.
 39  * To obtain a memory access var handle, clients must start from one of the &lt;em&gt;leaf&lt;/em&gt; methods
 40  * (see {@link MemoryHandles#varHandle(Class, ByteOrder)},
 41  * {@link MemoryHandles#varHandle(Class, long, ByteOrder)}). This determines the variable type
 42  * (all primitive types but {@code void} and {@code boolean} are supported, along with {@code MemoryAddress}), as well as the alignment constraint and the
 43  * byte order associated to a memory access var handle. The resulting memory access var handle can then be combined in various ways
 44  * to emulate different addressing modes. The var handles created by this class feature a &lt;em&gt;mandatory&lt;/em&gt; coordinate type
 45  * (of type {@link MemoryAddress}), and zero or more {@code long} coordinate types, which can be used to emulate
 46  * multi-dimensional array indexing.
 47  * &lt;p&gt;
 48  * As an example, consider the memory layout expressed by a {@link SequenceLayout} instance constructed as follows:
 49  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
 50 SequenceLayout seq = MemoryLayout.ofSequence(5,
 51     MemoryLayout.ofStruct(
