       * Returns a new native memory segment with given base address and size; the returned segment has its own temporal
       * bounds, and can therefore be closed; closing such a segment can optionally result in calling an user-provided cleanup
       * action. This method can be very useful when interacting with custom native memory sources (e.g. custom allocators,
       * GPU memory, etc.), where an address to some underlying memory region is typically obtained from native code
       * (often as a plain {@code long} value).
<span class="line-removed">-      * &lt;p&gt;Since the cleanup action is an {@link AutoCloseable} object, another memory segment can be used to specify a</span>
<span class="line-removed">-      * cleanup operation; this can be useful in cases where the user would like to take an existing native segment</span>
<span class="line-removed">-      * and tweak some of the properties of the original segment - as demonstrated below:</span>

<span class="line-removed">-      * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</span>
<span class="line-removed">-      * The above code takes an existing native segment and creates an unsafe segment that refers to the same</span>
<span class="line-removed">-      * underlying memory region as that of the original segment, but where thread-confinement constraints</span>
<span class="line-removed">-      * have been dropped.</span>
       * &lt;p&gt;
       * This method is &lt;em&gt;restricted&lt;/em&gt;. Restricted method are unsafe, and, if used incorrectly, their use might crash
       * the JVM crash or, worse, silently result in memory corruption. Thus, clients should refrain from depending on
       * restricted methods, and use safe and supported functionalities, where possible.
