1 Section 16 of ECMAScript 5.1 spec details a set of &quot;early errors&quot;. Early
2 errors should be reported before running any line of the script containing
3 such error(s). Examples include syntax error, errors in regexp literals etc.
4 This directory contains tests to check early errors are reported as early
5 errors. Each test starts with a print call -- the output from print should 
6 not be seen in expected output. If seen, early errors are reported late.
