30 // problem 1
31 // the conversions in TernaryNode are not necessary, but they should not cause problems. They did
32 // this was because the result of Global.allocate(Object[])Object which returns a NativeObject.
33 // was tracked as an object type on our stack. The type system did not recognize this as an array.
34 // Then the explicit conversions became &quot;convert NativeArray-&gt;Object[]&quot; which is a checkccast Object[]
35 // which naturally failed.
36 
37 // I pushed the appropriate arraytype on the stack for Global.allocate.
38 
39 // I also removed the conversions in CodeGen, all conversions should be done in Lower, as
40 // NASHORN-706 states.

44 
45 // This made the test pass, but it&#39;s still not correct to pick widest types for array
46 // and primitives. Widest(Object[], int) gave us Object[] which makes no sense. This is used
47 // by lower to type the conversions, so function b below also failed until I made a change
48 // ty type widest to actually return the widest common denominator, if both aren&#39;t arrays
