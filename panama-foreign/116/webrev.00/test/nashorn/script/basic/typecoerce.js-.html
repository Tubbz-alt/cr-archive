25  * There was a bug in the old Lower that didn&#39;t fully propagate type information
26  * by way of assignment. &#39;q&#39; in the example below would have finished a double
27  * even though it can get an object value through the assignment &#39;q = l&#39;
28  *
29  * Furthermore, this caused type coercion to be done at q = l, and not a q = q * 2,
30  * which is a bug. This test ensures it happens in the correct order
