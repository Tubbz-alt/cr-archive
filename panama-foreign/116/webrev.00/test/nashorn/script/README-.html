 1 basic:
 2 
 3 &quot;basic&quot; language and library tests. These need run only with File read 
 4 permission to read files under &quot;test/script&quot; or subdirs and property read
 5 permission to read properties named &quot;nashorn.test.*&quot;
 6 
 7 error:
 8 
 9 scripts that should result in compile-time error. The expected files check
10 for the error message format etc.
11 
12 currently-failing: 
13 
14 Tests that fail currently - but should pass eventually.
15 These are excluded for now.
16 
17 sandbox:
18 
19 Tests to check that sandbox scripts cannot access security sensitive resources.
20 Scripts under this directory run with no special permissions other than
21 what is given to all &quot;sandbox&quot; scripts.
22 
23 trusted:
24 
25 These tests run under AllPermission. Put only those scripts that really need
26 AllPermission - say for eg. creating class loader, full reflective access.
