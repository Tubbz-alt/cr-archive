 1 This directory contains samples for Dynalink API (http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/276).
 2 These samples require a jar file to be built and such jars be placed in the
 3 classpath of the jjs tool. Linker samples are named with the naming pattern
 4 &quot;xyz_linker.js&quot;. These scripts build dynalink linker jar from java code and exec
 5 another jjs process with appropriate classpath set.

 7 Dynalink samples:
 8 
 9 * array_stream_linker.js
10 
11 This sample builds ArrayStreamLinkerExporter.java and uses it in a sample script
12 called &quot;array_stream.js&quot;. This linker adds &quot;stream&quot; property to Java array
13 objects. The &quot;stream&quot; property returns appropriate Stream type for the given
14 Java array (IntStream, DoubleStream ...).
15 
16 * buffer_indexing_linker.js
17 
18 This sample builds BufferIndexingLinkerExporter.java and uses it in a sample script
19 called &quot;buffer_index.js&quot;. This linker adds array-like indexed access, indexed assignment
20 and &quot;length&quot; property to Java NIO Buffer objects. Script can treat NIO Buffer objects
21 as if those are just array objects.
22 
23 * dom_linker.js
24 
25 This sample builds DOMLinkerExporter.java and uses it in a sample script
26 called &quot;dom_linker_gutenberg.js&quot;. This linker handles DOM Element objects to add
27 properties to access child elements of a given element by child element tag name.
28 This simplifies script access of parsed XML DOM Documents.
29 
30 * missing_method_linker.js
31 
32 This sample builds MissingMethodLinkerExporter.java and uses it in a sample script
33 called &quot;missing_method.js&quot;. This linker supports Smalltalk-style &quot;doesNotUnderstand&quot;
34 calls on Java objects. i.e., A Java class can implement MissingMethodHandler interface
35 with one method named &quot;doesNotUnderstand&quot;. When script accesses a method on such
36 object and if that method does not exist in the Java class (or any of it&#39;s supertypes),
37 then &quot;doesNotUnderstand&quot; method is invoked.
38 
39 * underscore_linker.js
40 
41 This sample builds UnderscoreNameLinkerExporter.java and uses it in a sample script
42 called &quot;underscore.js&quot;. This linker converts underscore separated names to Camel Case
43 names (as used in Java APIs). You can call Java APIs using Ruby-like naming convention
44 and this linker converts method names to CamelCase!
