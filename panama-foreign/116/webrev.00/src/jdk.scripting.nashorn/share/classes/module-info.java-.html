 27  * Provides the implementation of Nashorn script engine and
 28  * the runtime environment for programs written in ECMAScript 5.1.
 29  * &lt;p&gt;
 30  * Nashorn is a runtime environment for programs written in ECMAScript 5.1.
 31  * &lt;/p&gt;
 32  *
 33  * &lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
 34  *
 35  * The recommended way to use Nashorn is through the
 36  * &lt;a href=&quot;http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;JSR-223
 37  * &quot;Scripting for the Java Platform&quot;&lt;/a&gt; APIs found in the
 38  * {@link javax.script} package. Usually, you&#39;ll obtain a
 39  * {@link javax.script.ScriptEngine} instance for Nashorn using:
 40  * &lt;pre&gt;
 41 import javax.script.*;
 42 ...
 43 ScriptEngine nashornEngine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(&quot;nashorn&quot;);
 44 &lt;/pre&gt;
 45  *
 46  * and then use it just as you would any other JSR-223 script engine. See
 47  * {@link jdk.nashorn.api.scripting} package for details.
 48  * &lt;h2&gt;Compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;
 49  * Nashorn is 100% compliant with the
 50  * &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm&quot;
 51  * target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;ECMA-262 Standard, Edition 5.1&lt;/a&gt;.
 52  * It requires a Java Virtual Machine that implements the
 53  * &lt;a href=&quot;http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=292&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;
 54  * JSR-292 &quot;Supporting Dynamically Typed Languages on the Java Platform&quot;&lt;/a&gt;
 55  * specification (often referred to as &quot;invokedynamic&quot;), as well as
 56  * the already mentioned JSR-223.
 57  *
 58  * &lt;h2&gt;Interoperability with the Java platform&lt;/h2&gt;
 59  *
 60  * In addition to being a 100% ECMAScript 5.1 runtime, Nashorn provides features
 61  * for interoperability of the ECMAScript programs with the Java platform.
 62  * In general, any Java object put into the script engine&#39;s context will be
 63  * visible from the script. In terms of the standard, such Java objects are not
 64  * considered &quot;native objects&quot;, but rather &quot;host objects&quot;, as defined in
 65  * section 4.3.8. This distinction allows certain semantical differences
 66  * in handling them compared to native objects. For most purposes, Java objects
 67  * behave just as native objects do: you can invoke their methods, get and set
 68  * their properties. In most cases, though, you can&#39;t add arbitrary properties
 69  * to them, nor can you remove existing properties.
 70  *
 71  * &lt;h3&gt;Java collection handling&lt;/h3&gt;
 72  *
 73  * Native Java arrays and {@link java.util.List}s support indexed access to
 74  * their elements through the property accessors, and {@link java.util.Map}s
 75  * support both property and element access through both dot and square-bracket
 76  * property accessors, with the difference being that dot operator gives
 77  * precedence to object properties (its fields and properties defined as
 78  * {@code getXxx} and {@code setXxx} methods) while the square bracket
 79  * operator gives precedence to map elements. Native Java arrays expose
 80  * the {@code length} property.
 81  *
 82  * &lt;h3&gt;ECMAScript primitive types&lt;/h3&gt;
 83  *
 84  * ECMAScript primitive types for number, string, and boolean are represented
 85  * with {@link java.lang.Number}, {@link java.lang.CharSequence}, and
 86  * {@link java.lang.Boolean} objects. While the most often used number type
 87  * is {@link java.lang.Double} and the most often used string type is
 88  * {@link java.lang.String}, don&#39;t rely on it as various internal optimizations
 89  * cause other subclasses of {@code Number} and internal implementations of
 90  * {@code CharSequence} to be used.
 91  *
 92  * &lt;h3&gt;Type conversions&lt;/h3&gt;
 93  *
 94  * When a method on a Java object is invoked, the arguments are converted to
 95  * the formal parameter types of the Java method using all allowed ECMAScript
 96  * conversions. This can be surprising, as in general, conversions from string
 97  * to number will succeed according to Standard&#39;s section 9.3 &quot;ToNumber&quot;
 98  * and so on; string to boolean, number to boolean, Object to number,
 99  * Object to string all work. Note that if the Java method&#39;s declared parameter
100  * type is {@code java.lang.Object}, Nashorn objects are passed without any
101  * conversion whatsoever; specifically if the JavaScript value being passed
102  * is of primitive string type, you can only rely on it being a
103  * {@code java.lang.CharSequence}, and if the value is a number, you can only
104  * rely on it being a {@code java.lang.Number}. If the Java method declared
105  * parameter type is more specific (e.g. {@code java.lang.String} or
106  * {@code java.lang.Double}), then Nashorn will of course ensure
107  * the required type is passed.
108  *
109  * &lt;h3&gt;SAM types&lt;/h3&gt;
110  *
111  * As a special extension when invoking Java methods, ECMAScript function
112  * objects can be passed in place of an argument whose Java type is so-called
113  * &quot;single abstract method&quot; or &quot;SAM&quot; type. While this name usually covers
114  * single-method interfaces, Nashorn is a bit more versatile, and it
115  * recognizes a type as a SAM type if all its abstract methods are
116  * overloads of the same name, and it is either an interface, or it is an
117  * abstract class with a no-arg constructor. The type itself must be public,
118  * while the constructor and the methods can be either public or protected.
119  * If there are multiple abstract overloads of the same name, the single
120  * function will serve as the shared implementation for all of them,
121  * &lt;em&gt;and additionally it will also override any non-abstract methods of
122  * the same name&lt;/em&gt;. This is done to be consistent with the fact that
123  * ECMAScript does not have the concept of overloaded methods.
124  *
125  * &lt;h3&gt;The {@code Java} object&lt;/h3&gt;
126  *
127  * Nashorn exposes a non-standard global object named {@code Java} that is
128  * the primary API entry point into Java platform-specific functionality.
129  * You can use it to create instances of Java classes, convert from Java arrays
130  * to native arrays and back, and so on.
131  *
132  * &lt;h3&gt;Other non-standard built-in objects&lt;/h3&gt;
133  *
134  * In addition to {@code Java}, Nashorn also exposes some other
135  * non-standard built-in objects:
136  * {@code JSAdapter}, {@code JavaImporter}, {@code Packages}
137  *
138  * @deprecated Nashorn JavaScript script engine and APIs, and the jjs tool
139  * are deprecated with the intent to remove them in a future release.
140  *
