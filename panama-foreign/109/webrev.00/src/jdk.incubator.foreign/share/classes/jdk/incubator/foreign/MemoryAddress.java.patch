 /**
  * A memory address models a reference into a memory location. Memory addresses are typically obtained using the
  * {@link MemorySegment#baseAddress()} method; such addresses are said to be <em>checked</em>, and can be expressed
  * as <em>offsets</em> into some underlying memory segment (see {@link #segment()} and {@link #segmentOffset()}).
