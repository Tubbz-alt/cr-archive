 39 // We need to coordinate the actions of the target thread, the GC thread
 40 // and the WB main test method. To simplify things we use the target
 41 // thread&#39;s priority field to indicate the state of the test as follows:
 42 // - Start the target thread with priority 5 (NORM_PRIORITY), it will run
 43 //   until its priority is boosted by 1
 44 // - Start the GC thread, which will spin until the target thread&#39;s priority
 45 //   has been boosted by 2
 46 // - Call into the WB test method and:
 47 //   - Grab a ThreadsListHandle and ensure it contains the target
 48 //   - Increase the target priority by one so it will terminate
 49 //   - Wait until we see the JavaThread has terminated
 50 //   - Increase the target thread priority by one again to release the GC thread
 51 //   - Check the original Thread oop with the target-&gt;threadObj to see if they
 52 //     are the same (looping a few times to improve the chances of GC having
 53 //     time to move the underlying object).
 54 //   - If the oop has changed throw an exception
