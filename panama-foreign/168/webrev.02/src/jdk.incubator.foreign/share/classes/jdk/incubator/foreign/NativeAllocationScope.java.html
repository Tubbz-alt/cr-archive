 36  * This class provides a scope of given size, within which several allocations can be performed. An allocation scope is backed
 37  * by off-heap memory. Allocation scopes can be either &lt;em&gt;bounded&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;unbounded&lt;/em&gt;, depending on whether the size
 38  * of the allocation scope is known statically. If an application knows before-hand how much memory it needs to allocate the values it needs,
 39  * using a &lt;em&gt;bounded&lt;/em&gt; allocation scope will typically provide better performances than independently allocating the memory
 40  * for each value (e.g. using {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)}), or using an &lt;em&gt;unbounded&lt;/em&gt; allocation scope.
 41  * For this reason, using a bounded allocation scope is recommended in cases where programs might need to emulate native stack allocation.
