 38  * A memory segment models a contiguous region of memory. A memory segment is associated with both spatial
 39  * and temporal bounds. Spatial bounds ensure that memory access operations on a memory segment cannot affect a memory location
 40  * which falls &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment being accessed. Temporal checks ensure that memory access
 41  * operations on a segment cannot occur after a memory segment has been closed (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}).
 42  * &lt;p&gt;
 43  * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
 44  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 45  * instances of {@code MemorySegment} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 46  * be used for comparisons.
 47  * &lt;p&gt;
 48  * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemorySegment} directly.
 49  *
 50  * &lt;h2&gt;Constructing memory segments from different sources&lt;/h2&gt;
 51  *
 52  * There are multiple ways to obtain a memory segment. First, memory segments backed by off-heap memory can
 53  * be allocated using one of the many factory methods provided (see {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(MemoryLayout)},
 54  * {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)} and {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long, long)}). Memory segments obtained
 55  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;native memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 56  * &lt;p&gt;
 57  * It is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing heap-allocated Java array,
 58  * using one of the provided factory methods (e.g. {@link MemorySegment#ofArray(int[])}). Memory segments obtained
 59  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;array memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 60  * &lt;p&gt;
 61  * It is possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing Java byte buffer (see {@link ByteBuffer}),
 62  * using the factory method {@link MemorySegment#ofByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)}.
 63  * Memory segments obtained in this way are called &lt;em&gt;buffer memory segments&lt;/em&gt;. Note that buffer memory segments might
 64  * be backed by native memory (as in the case of native memory segments) or heap memory (as in the case of array memory segments),
 65  * depending on the characteristics of the byte buffer instance the segment is associated with. For instance, a buffer memory
 66  * segment obtained from a byte buffer created with the {@link ByteBuffer#allocateDirect(int)} method will be backed
 67  * by native memory.
 68  * &lt;p&gt;
 69  * Finally, it is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by a memory-mapped file using the factory method
 70  * {@link MemorySegment#mapFromPath(Path, long, FileChannel.MapMode)}. Such memory segments are called &lt;em&gt;mapped memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 71  *
 72  * &lt;h2&gt;Closing a memory segment&lt;/h2&gt;
 73  *
 74  * Memory segments are closed explicitly (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}). In general when a segment is closed, all off-heap
 75  * resources associated with it are released; this has different meanings depending on the kind of memory segment being
 76  * considered:
 77  * &lt;ul&gt;
 78  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a native memory segment results in &lt;em&gt;freeing&lt;/em&gt; the native memory associated with it&lt;/li&gt;
 79  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a mapped memory segment results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped&lt;/li&gt;
 80  *     &lt;li&gt;closing an acquired memory segment &lt;b&gt;does not&lt;/b&gt; result in the release of resources
 81  *     (see the section on &lt;a href=&quot;#thread-confinement&quot;&gt;thread confinement&lt;/a&gt; for more details)&lt;/li&gt;
 82  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a buffer, or a heap segment does not have any side-effect, other than marking the segment
 83  *     as &lt;em&gt;not alive&lt;/em&gt; (see {@link MemorySegment#isAlive()}). Also, since the buffer and heap segments might keep
 84  *     strong references to the original buffer or array instance, it is the responsibility of clients to ensure that
 85  *     these segments are discarded in a timely manner, so as not to prevent garbage collection to reclaim the underlying
 86  *     objects.&lt;/li&gt;
 87  * &lt;/ul&gt;
 88  *
 89  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;thread-confinement&quot;&gt;Thread confinement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 90  *
 91  * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,
 92  * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
 93  * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
 94  * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
 95  * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
 96  * &lt;p&gt;
 97  * If a memory segment S owned by thread A needs to be used by thread B, B needs to explicitly &lt;em&gt;acquire&lt;/em&gt; S,
 98  * which will create a so called &lt;em&gt;acquired&lt;/em&gt; memory segment owned by B (see {@link #acquire()}) backed by the same resources
 99  * as S. A memory segment can be acquired multiple times by one or more threads; in that case, a memory segment S cannot
100  * be closed until all the acquired memory segments derived from S have been closed. Furthermore, closing an acquired
101  * memory segment does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trigger any deallocation action. It is therefore important that clients remember to
102  * explicitly close the original segment from which the acquired memory segments have been obtained in order to truly
103  * ensure that off-heap resources associated with the memory segment are released.
104  *
105  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;access-modes&quot;&gt;Access modes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
106  *
107  * Memory segments supports zero or more &lt;em&gt;access modes&lt;/em&gt;. Supported access modes are {@link #READ},
108  * {@link #WRITE}, {@link #CLOSE} and {@link #ACQUIRE}. The set of access modes supported by a segment alters the
109  * set of operations that are supported by that segment. For instance, attempting to call {@link #close()} on
110  * a segment which does not support the {@link #CLOSE} access mode will result in an exception.
111  * &lt;p&gt;
112  * The set of supported access modes can only be made stricter (by supporting &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; access modes). This means
113  * that restricting the set of access modes supported by a segment before sharing it with other clients
114  * is generally a good practice if the creator of the segment wants to retain some control over how the segment
115  * is going to be accessed.
116  *
117  * &lt;h2&gt;Memory segment views&lt;/h2&gt;
118  *
119  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, it is possible to alter the set of supported access modes,
120  * by creating an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; view of a memory segment, as follows:
121  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
122 MemorySegment segment = ...
123 MemorySegment roSegment = segment.withAccessModes(segment.accessModes() &amp; ~WRITE);
124  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
125  * It is also possible to create views whose spatial bounds are stricter than the ones of the original segment
126  * (see {@link MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long)}).
127  * &lt;p&gt;
128  * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
129  * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
130  * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
131  * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as removing {@link #CLOSE}
132  * from the set of supported access modes, before sharing the view with another client.
133  * &lt;p&gt;
134  * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
135  * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
136  * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
137  * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory address from which they originated.
138  *
139  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
140  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
141  * explicitly permitted types.
142  *
143  * @implSpec
144  * Implementations of this interface are immutable and thread-safe.
