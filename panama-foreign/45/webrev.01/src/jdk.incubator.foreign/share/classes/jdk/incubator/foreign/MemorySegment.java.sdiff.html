 85  *     these segments are discarded in a timely manner, so as not to prevent garbage collection to reclaim the underlying
 86  *     objects.&lt;/li&gt;
 87  * &lt;/ul&gt;
 88  *
 89  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;thread-confinement&quot;&gt;Thread confinement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 90  *
 91  * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,
 92  * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
 93  * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
 94  * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
 95  * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
 96  * &lt;p&gt;
 97  * If a memory segment S owned by thread A needs to be used by thread B, B needs to explicitly &lt;em&gt;acquire&lt;/em&gt; S,
 98  * which will create a so called &lt;em&gt;acquired&lt;/em&gt; memory segment owned by B (see {@link #acquire()}) backed by the same resources
 99  * as S. A memory segment can be acquired multiple times by one or more threads; in that case, a memory segment S cannot
100  * be closed until all the acquired memory segments derived from S have been closed. Furthermore, closing an acquired
101  * memory segment does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trigger any deallocation action. It is therefore important that clients remember to
102  * explicitly close the original segment from which the acquired memory segments have been obtained in order to truly
103  * ensure that off-heap resources associated with the memory segment are released.
104  *












105  * &lt;h2&gt;Memory segment views&lt;/h2&gt;
106  *
<span class="line-modified">107  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;. It is possible to create an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; view of a memory segment</span>
<span class="line-modified">108  * (see {@link MemorySegment#asReadOnly()}) which does not support write operations. It is also possible to create views</span>
<span class="line-modified">109  * whose spatial bounds are stricter than the ones of the original segment (see {@link MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long)}).</span>





110  * &lt;p&gt;
111  * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
112  * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
113  * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
<span class="line-modified">114  * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as calling</span>
<span class="line-modified">115  * {@link MemorySegment#acquire()} before sharing the view with another client.</span>
116  * &lt;p&gt;
117  * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
118  * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
119  * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
120  * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory address from which they originated.
121  *
122  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
