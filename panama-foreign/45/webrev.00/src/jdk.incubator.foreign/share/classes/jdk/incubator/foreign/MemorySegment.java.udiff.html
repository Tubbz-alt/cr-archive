<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * &lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * The set of supported access modes can only be made stricter (by supporting &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; access modes). This means</span>

<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, it is possible to alter the set of supported access modes,</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * by creating an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; view of a memory segment, as follows:</span>

   * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
   * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
   * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as calling</span>

   * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
   * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the
   * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
   * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory address from which they originated.
