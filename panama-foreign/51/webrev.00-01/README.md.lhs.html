15 About Project Panama
16 ===================
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified">17 This is a repo of OpenJDK Project Panama: Interconnecting JVM and native code. You can find more information at: https://openjdk.java.net/projects/panama/</span>

24 ===================
<a name="5" id="anc5"></a><span class="line-modified">25 This repo houses three main branches:</span>
<span class="line-modified">26 - **foreign-memaccess**: Contains the developement of the foreign memory access API for [JEP 370](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/370), which can be used to interact with different kinds of memory resource, inluding so-called off-heap or native memory.</span>
<span class="line-modified">27 - **foreign-abi**: Contains the developement of the foreign function interface (FFI), which can be used to call native code in a  .dll/.so/.dylib, or to create a native function pointer to a Java method which can be passed to code in a native library.</span>
<span class="line-modified">28 - **foreign-jextract**: Contains the developement of the jextract API, which can be used to create an abstract syntax tree from a C header file. There&#39;s also the accompanying jextract tool, which is a wrapper for the API and can be used to generate a Java interface to call the C library described by a given header file.</span>
29 
<a name="6" id="anc6"></a><span class="line-modified">30 The foreign-jextract branch depends on the foreign-abi branch, which in turn depends on the foreign-memaccess branch. As such, the foreign-jextract is the most complete of the three and therefore the default branch of this repository.</span>

32 Building notes
33 ===================
<a name="7" id="anc7"></a><span class="line-modified">34 Jextract requires [LLVM 9.x](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) as a dependency. So, if you want to build the foreign-jextract branch yourself you will need to pass `--with-libclang=/path/to/llvm/root` when generating a build configuration. Please see [doc/building.md](https://github.com/openjdk/panama-foreign/blob/foreign-jextract/doc/building.md) for general building instructions.</span>
