15 About Project Panama
16 ===================
<span class="line-modified">17 This is a repo of OpenJDK Project Panama: Interconnecting JVM and native code. You can find more information at: https://openjdk.java.net/projects/panama/</span>
18 
<span class="line-modified">19 You can find the Project Panama JBS dashboard at: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=18412</span>
20 
<span class="line-modified">21 You can find early access (EA) snapshots at: http://jdk.java.net/panama/</span>

<span class="line-modified">23 About the panama-foreign repo</span>
24 ===================
<span class="line-modified">25 This repo houses three main branches:</span>
<span class="line-modified">26 - **foreign-memaccess**: Contains the developement of the foreign memory access API for [JEP 370](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/370), which can be used to interact with different kinds of memory resource, inluding so-called off-heap or native memory.</span>
<span class="line-modified">27 - **foreign-abi**: Contains the developement of the foreign function interface (FFI), which can be used to call native code in a  .dll/.so/.dylib, or to create a native function pointer to a Java method which can be passed to code in a native library.</span>
<span class="line-modified">28 - **foreign-jextract**: Contains the developement of the jextract API, which can be used to create an abstract syntax tree from a C header file. There&#39;s also the accompanying jextract tool, which is a wrapper for the API and can be used to generate a Java interface to call the C library described by a given header file.</span>
29 
<span class="line-modified">30 The foreign-jextract branch depends on the foreign-abi branch, which in turn depends on the foreign-memaccess branch. As such, the foreign-jextract is the most complete of the three and therefore the default branch of this repository.</span>
31 
32 Building notes
33 ===================
<span class="line-modified">34 Jextract requires [LLVM 9.x](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) as a dependency. So, if you want to build the foreign-jextract branch yourself you will need to pass `--with-libclang=/path/to/llvm/root` when generating a build configuration. Please see [doc/building.md](https://github.com/openjdk/panama-foreign/blob/foreign-jextract/doc/building.md) for general building instructions.</span>

15 About Project Panama
16 ===================
<span class="line-modified">17 This repository contains changes which aim at improving the interoperability between the Java programming language and native libraries, which is one of the main goals of Project Panama. More information can be found at: https://openjdk.java.net/projects/panama/</span>

This branch also provides an accompanying extraction tool (jextract), which is built on top of the API, and can be used to generate Java bindings to access functions and/or structs in a native library described by a given header file.</span>
