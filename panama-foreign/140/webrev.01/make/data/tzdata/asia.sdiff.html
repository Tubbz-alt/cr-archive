1861 # Occupation authorities imposed daylight-saving time on Japan on
1862 # [1948-05-01]....  But lack of prior debate and the execution of
1863 # daylight-saving time just three days after the bill was passed generated
1864 # deep hatred of the concept....  The Diet unceremoniously passed a bill to
1865 # dump the unpopular system in October 1951, less than a month after the San
1866 # Francisco Peace Treaty was signed.  (A government poll in 1951 showed 53%

1998 # Today&#39;s _Asahi Evening News_ (page 4) reports that Japan had
1999 # daylight saving between 1948 and 1951, but &quot;the system was discontinued
2000 # because the public believed it would lead to longer working hours.&quot;

2006 # daylight-saving time just three days after the bill was passed generated
2007 # deep hatred of the concept....  The Diet unceremoniously passed a bill to
2008 # dump the unpopular system in October 1951, less than a month after the San
2009 # Francisco Peace Treaty was signed.  (A government poll in 1951 showed 53%
2010 # of the Japanese wanted to scrap daylight-saving time, as opposed to 30% who
2011 # wanted to keep it.)
