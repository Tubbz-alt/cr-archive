  38 # San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
  39 # Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
  40 #
  41 # Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
  42 # for time zone data was the International Air Transport
  43 # Association&#39;s Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
  44 # published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
  45 # of the IATA&#39;s data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
  46 # IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
  47 #
  48 # A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
  49 # Derek Howse, Greenwich time and longitude, Philip Wilson Publishers (1997).
  50 #
  51 # Except where otherwise noted, Shanks &amp; Pottenger is the source for

 127 # Britain (United Kingdom) and Ireland (Eire)
 128 
 129 # From Peter Ilieve (1994-07-06):
 130 #
 131 # On 17 Jan 1994 the Independent, a UK quality newspaper, had a piece about
 132 # historical vistas along the Thames in west London. There was a photo
 133 # and a sketch map showing some of the sightlines involved. One paragraph
 134 # of the text said:
 135 #
 136 # &#39;An old stone obelisk marking a forgotten terrestrial meridian stands
 137 # beside the river at Kew. In the 18th century, before time and longitude
 138 # was standardised by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, scholars observed
 139 # this stone and the movement of stars from Kew Observatory nearby. They
 140 # made their calculations and set the time for the Horse Guards and Parliament,
 141 # but now the stone is obscured by scrubwood and can only be seen by walking
 142 # along the towpath within a few yards of it.&#39;
 143 #
 144 # I have a one inch to one mile map of London and my estimate of the stone&#39;s
 145 # position is 51° 28&#39; 30&quot; N, 0° 18&#39; 45&quot; W. The longitude should
 146 # be within about ±2&quot;. The Ordnance Survey grid reference is TQ172761.
 147 #
 148 # [This yields STDOFF = -0:01:15 for London LMT in the 18th century.]
 149 
 150 # From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
 151 #
 152 # Howse writes that Britain was the first country to use standard time.
 153 # The railways cared most about the inconsistencies of local mean time,
 154 # and it was they who forced a uniform time on the country.
 155 # The original idea was credited to Dr. William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828)
 156 # and was popularized by Abraham Follett Osler (1808-1903).
 157 # The first railway to adopt London time was the Great Western Railway
 158 # in November 1840; other railways followed suit, and by 1847 most
 159 # (though not all) railways used London time.  On 1847-09-22 the
 160 # Railway Clearing House, an industry standards body, recommended that GMT be
 161 # adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it.
 162 # The transition occurred on 12-01 for the L&amp;NW, the Caledonian,
 163 # and presumably other railways; the January 1848 Bradshaw&#39;s lists many
 164 # railways as using GMT.  By 1855 the vast majority of public
 165 # clocks in Britain were set to GMT (though some, like the great clock
 166 # on Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, were fitted with two minute hands,
 167 # one for local time and one for GMT).  The last major holdout was the legal
 168 # system, which stubbornly stuck to local time for many years, leading
 169 # to oddities like polls opening at 08:13 and closing at 16:13.
 170 # The legal system finally switched to GMT when the Statutes (Definition
 171 # of Time) Act took effect; it received the Royal Assent on 1880-08-02.
 172 #
 173 # In the tables below, we condense this complicated story into a single
 174 # transition date for London, namely 1847-12-01.  We don&#39;t know as much
 175 # about Dublin, so we use 1880-08-02, the legal transition time.
 176 
 177 # From Paul Eggert (2014-07-19):
 178 # The ancients had no need for daylight saving, as they kept time
 179 # informally or via hours whose length depended on the time of year.
 180 # Daylight saving time in its modern sense was invented by the
 181 # New Zealand entomologist George Vernon Hudson (1867-1946),
 182 # whose day job as a postal clerk led him to value
 183 # after-hours daylight in which to pursue his research.
 184 # In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society
 185 # that proposed a two-hour daylight-saving shift.  See:
 186 # Hudson GV. On seasonal time-adjustment in countries south of lat. 30°.
 187 # Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute. 1895;28:734
 188 # http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_28/rsnz_28_00_006110.html
 189 # Although some interest was expressed in New Zealand, his proposal
 190 # did not find its way into law and eventually it was almost forgotten.
 191 #
 192 # In England, DST was independently reinvented by William Willett (1857-1915),
 193 # a London builder and member of the Royal Astronomical Society
 194 # who circulated a pamphlet &quot;The Waste of Daylight&quot; (1907)
 195 # that proposed advancing clocks 20 minutes on each of four Sundays in April,
 196 # and retarding them by the same amount on four Sundays in September.
 197 # A bill was drafted in 1909 and introduced in Parliament several times,
 198 # but it met with ridicule and opposition, especially from farming interests.
 199 # Later editions of the pamphlet proposed one-hour summer time, and
 200 # it was eventually adopted as a wartime measure in 1916.
 201 # See: Summer Time Arrives Early, The Times (2000-05-18).
 202 # A monument to Willett was unveiled on 1927-05-21, in an open space in
 203 # a 45-acre wood near Chislehurst, Kent that was purchased by popular
 204 # subscription and open to the public.  On the south face of the monolith,
 205 # designed by G. W. Miller, is the William Willett Memorial Sundial,
 206 # which is permanently set to Summer Time.
 207 
 208 # From Winston Churchill (1934-04-28):
 209 # It is one of the paradoxes of history that we should owe the boon of
 210 # summer time, which gives every year to the people of this country
 211 # between 160 and 170 hours more daylight leisure, to a war which
 212 # plunged Europe into darkness for four years, and shook the
 213 # foundations of civilization throughout the world.

 217 
 218 # From Paul Eggert (2015-08-08):
 219 # The OED Supplement says that the English originally said &quot;Daylight Saving&quot;
 220 # when they were debating the adoption of DST in 1908; but by 1916 this
 221 # term appears only in quotes taken from DST&#39;s opponents, whereas the
 222 # proponents (who eventually won the argument) are quoted as using &quot;Summer&quot;.
 223 # The term &quot;Summer Time&quot; was introduced by Herbert Samuel, Home Secretary; see:
 224 # Viscount Samuel. Leisure in a Democracy. Cambridge University Press
 225 # ISBN 978-1-107-49471-8 (1949, reissued 2015), p 8.
 226 
 227 # From Arthur David Olson (1989-01-19):
 228 # A source at the British Information Office in New York avers that it&#39;s
 229 # known as &quot;British&quot; Summer Time in all parts of the United Kingdom.
 230 
 231 # Date: 4 Jan 89 08:57:25 GMT (Wed)
 232 # From: Jonathan Leffler
 233 # [British Summer Time] is fixed annually by Act of Parliament.
 234 # If you can predict what Parliament will do, you should be in
 235 # politics making a fortune, not computing.
 236 
 237 # From Chris Carrier (1996-06-14):
 238 # I remember reading in various wartime issues of the London Times the
 239 # acronym BDST for British Double Summer Time.  Look for the published
 240 # time of sunrise and sunset in The Times, when BDST was in effect, and
 241 # if you find a zone reference it will say, &quot;All times B.D.S.T.&quot;
 242 
 243 # From Joseph S. Myers (1999-09-02):
 244 # ... some military cables (WO 219/4100 - this is a copy from the
 245 # main SHAEF archives held in the US National Archives, SHAEF/5252/8/516)
 246 # agree that the usage is BDST (this appears in a message dated 17 Feb 1945).
 247 
 248 # From Joseph S. Myers (2000-10-03):
 249 # On 18th April 1941, Sir Stephen Tallents of the BBC wrote to Sir
 250 # Alexander Maxwell of the Home Office asking whether there was any
 251 # official designation; the reply of the 21st was that there wasn&#39;t
 252 # but he couldn&#39;t think of anything better than the &quot;Double British
 253 # Summer Time&quot; that the BBC had been using informally.

 255 # https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/ho-19410421.png
 256 
 257 # From Sir Alexander Maxwell in the above-mentioned letter (1941-04-21):
 258 # [N]o official designation has as far as I know been adopted for the time
 259 # which is to be introduced in May....
 260 # I cannot think of anything better than &quot;Double British Summer Time&quot;
 261 # which could not be said to run counter to any official description.
 262 
 263 # From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
 264 # Howse writes (p 157) &#39;DBST&#39; too, but &#39;BDST&#39; seems to have been common
 265 # and follows the more usual convention of putting the location name first,
 266 # so we use &#39;BDST&#39;.
 267 
 268 # Peter Ilieve (1998-04-19) described at length
 269 # the history of summer time legislation in the United Kingdom.
 270 # Since 1998 Joseph S. Myers has been updating
 271 # and extending this list, which can be found in
 272 # https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/
 273 
 274 # From Joseph S. Myers (1998-01-06):
 275 #
 276 # The legal time in the UK outside of summer time is definitely GMT, not UTC;
 277 # see Lord Tanlaw&#39;s speech
 278 # https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo970611/text/70611-10.htm#70611-10_head0
 279 # (Lords Hansard 11 June 1997 columns 964 to 976).
 280 
 281 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
 282 #
 283 # For lack of other data, follow Shanks &amp; Pottenger for Eire in 1940-1948.
 284 #
 285 # Given Ilieve and Myers&#39;s data, the following claims by Shanks &amp; Pottenger
 286 # are incorrect:
 287 #     * Wales did not switch from GMT to daylight saving time until
 288 #	1921 Apr 3, when they began to conform with the rest of Great Britain.
 289 # Actually, Wales was identical after 1880.
 290 #     * Eire had two transitions on 1916 Oct 1.
 291 # It actually just had one transition.
 292 #     * Northern Ireland used single daylight saving time throughout WW II.
 293 # Actually, it conformed to Britain.
 294 #     * GB-Eire changed standard time to 1 hour ahead of GMT on 1968-02-18.
 295 # Actually, that date saw the usual switch to summer time.
 296 # Standard time was not changed until 1968-10-27 (the clocks didn&#39;t change).
 297 #
 298 # Here is another incorrect claim by Shanks &amp; Pottenger:
 299 #     * Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man did not switch from GMT
 300 #	to daylight saving time until 1921 Apr 3, when they began to
 301 #	conform with Great Britain.
 302 # S.R.&amp;O. 1916, No. 382 and HO 45/10811/312364 (quoted above) say otherwise.
 303 #
 304 # The following claim by Shanks &amp; Pottenger is possible though doubtful;
 305 # we&#39;ll ignore it for now.
 306 #     * Dublin&#39;s 1971-10-31 switch was at 02:00, even though London&#39;s was 03:00.
 307 
 308 # From Paul Eggert (2017-12-04):
 309 #
 310 # Dunsink Observatory (8 km NW of Dublin&#39;s center) was to Dublin as
 311 # Greenwich was to London.  For example:
 312 #
 313 #   &quot;Timeball on the ballast office is down.  Dunsink time.&quot;
 314 #   -- James Joyce, Ulysses
 315 #
 316 # The abbreviation DMT stood for &quot;Dublin Mean Time&quot; or &quot;Dunsink Mean Time&quot;;
 317 # this being Ireland, opinions differed.
 318 #
 319 # Whitman says Dublin/Dunsink Mean Time was UT-00:25:21, which agrees
 320 # with measurements of recent visitors to the Meridian Room of Dunsink
 321 # Observatory; see Malone D. Dunsink and timekeeping. 2016-01-24.
 322 # &lt;https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwmalone/time/dunsink.html&gt;.  Malone
 323 # writes that the Nautical Almanac listed UT-00:25:22 until 1896, when
 324 # it moved to UT-00:25:21.1 (I confirmed that the 1893 edition used
 325 # the former and the 1896 edition used the latter).  Evidently the
 326 # news of this change propagated slowly, as Milne 1899 still lists
 327 # UT-00:25:22 and cites the International Telegraph Bureau.  As it is
 328 # not clear that there was any practical significance to the change
 329 # from UT-00:25:22 to UT-00:25:21.1 in civil timekeeping, omit this
 330 # transition for now and just use the latter value, omitting its
 331 # fraction since our format cannot represent fractions.
 332 
 333 # &quot;Countess Markievicz ... claimed that the [1916] abolition of Dublin Mean Time
 334 # was among various actions undertaken by the &#39;English&#39; government that
 335 # would &#39;put the whole country into the SF (Sinn Féin) camp&#39;.  She claimed
 336 # Irish &#39;public feeling (was) outraged by forcing of English time on us&#39;.&quot;

 361 # (These are those I found, but there could be more.  In any case these
 362 # should allow various updates to the comments in the europe file to cover
 363 # the laws applicable in Ireland.)
 364 #
 365 # (Note that the time in the Republic of Ireland since 1968 has been defined
 366 # in terms of standard time being GMT+1 with a period of winter time when it
 367 # is GMT, rather than standard time being GMT with a period of summer time
 368 # being GMT+1.)

 370 # From Paul Eggert (1999-03-28):
 371 # Clive Feather (&lt;news:859845706.26043.0@office.demon.net&gt;, 1997-03-31)
 372 # reports that Folkestone (Cheriton) Shuttle Terminal uses Concession Time
 373 # (CT), equivalent to French civil time.
 374 # Julian Hill (&lt;news:36118128.5A14@virgin.net&gt;, 1998-09-30) reports that
 375 # trains between Dollands Moor (the freight facility next door)
 376 # and Frethun run in CT.
 377 # My admittedly uninformed guess is that the terminal has two authorities,
 378 # the French concession operators and the British civil authorities,
 379 # and that the time depends on who you&#39;re talking to.
 380 # If, say, the British police were called to the station for some reason,
 381 # I would expect the official police report to use GMT/BST and not CET/CEST.
 382 # This is a borderline case, but for now let&#39;s stick to GMT/BST.
 383 
 384 # From an anonymous contributor (1996-06-02):
 385 # The law governing time in Ireland is under Statutory Instrument SI 395/94,
 386 # which gives force to European Union 7th Council Directive No. 94/21/EC.
 387 # Under this directive, the Minister for Justice in Ireland makes appropriate
 388 # regulations. I spoke this morning with the Secretary of the Department of
 389 # Justice (tel +353 1 678 9711) who confirmed to me that the correct name is
 390 # &quot;Irish Summer Time&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;IST&quot;.
 391 #
 392 # From Paul Eggert (2017-12-07):
 393 # The 1996 anonymous contributor&#39;s goal was to determine the correct
 394 # abbreviation for summer time in Dublin and so the contributor
 395 # focused on the &quot;IST&quot;, not on the &quot;Irish Summer Time&quot;.  Though the
 396 # &quot;IST&quot; was correct, the &quot;Irish Summer Time&quot; appears to have been an
 397 # error, as Ireland&#39;s Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 states that
 398 # standard time in Ireland remains at UT +01 and is observed in
 399 # summer, and that Greenwich mean time is observed in winter.  (Thanks
 400 # to Derick Rethans for pointing out the error.)  That is, when
 401 # Ireland amended the 1968 act that established UT +01 as Irish
 402 # Standard Time, it left standard time unchanged and established GMT
 403 # as a negative daylight saving time in winter.  So, in this database
 404 # IST stands for Irish Summer Time for timestamps before 1968, and for
 405 # Irish Standard Time after that.  See:

 536 # From Paul Eggert (2018-02-15):
 537 # In January 2018 we discovered that the negative SAVE values in the
 538 # Eire rules cause problems with tests for ICU:
 539 # https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025825.html
 540 # and with tests for OpenJDK:
 541 # https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025822.html
 542 #
 543 # To work around this problem, the build procedure can translate the
 544 # following data into two forms, one with negative SAVE values and the
 545 # other form with a traditional approximation for Irish timestamps
 546 # after 1971-10-31 02:00 UTC; although this approximation has tm_isdst
 547 # flags that are reversed, its UTC offsets are correct and this often
 548 # suffices.  This source file currently uses only nonnegative SAVE
 549 # values, but this is intended to change and downstream code should
 550 # not rely on it.
 551 #
 552 # The following is like GB-Eire and EU, except with standard time in
 553 # summer and negative daylight saving time in winter.  It is for when
 554 # negative SAVE values are used.

 913 # From Paul Eggert (2019-08-28):
 914 # This quote helps explain the late-1914 situation:
 915 #   In early November 1914, the Germans imposed the time zone used in central
 916 #   Europe and forced the inhabitants to set their watches and public clocks
 917 #   sixty minutes ahead.  Many were reluctant to accept &quot;German time&quot; and
 918 #   continued to use &quot;Belgian time&quot; among themselves.  Reflecting the spirit of
 919 #   resistance that arose in the population, a song made fun of this change....
 920 # The song ended:
 921 #   Putting your clock forward
 922 #   Will but hasten the happy hour

1054 # From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-04-26):
1055 # http://www.hum.aau.dk/~poe/tid/tine/DanskTid.htm says that the law
1056 # [introducing standard time] was in effect from 1894-01-01....
1057 # The page http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A18930008330-REGL
1058 # confirms this, and states that the law was put forth 1893-03-29.
1059 #
1060 # The EU [actually, EEC and Euratom] treaty with effect from 1973:
1061 # http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A19722110030-REGL
1062 #
1063 # This provoked a new law from 1974 to make possible summer time changes
1064 # in subsequent decrees with the law
1065 # http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A19740022330-REGL
1066 #
1067 # It seems however that no decree was set forward until 1980.  I have
1068 # not found any decree, but in another related law, the effecting DST
1069 # changes are stated explicitly to be from 1980-04-06 at 02:00 to
1070 # 1980-09-28 at 02:00.  If this is true, this differs slightly from
1071 # the EU rule in that DST runs to 02:00, not 03:00.  We don&#39;t know
1072 # when Denmark began using the EU rule correctly, but we have only
1073 # confirmation of the 1980-time, so I presume it was correct in 1981:
1074 # The law is about the management of the extra hour, concerning
1075 # working hours reported and effect on obligatory-rest rules (which
1076 # was suspended on that night):

1082 
1083 # From Paul Eggert (2005-06-11):
1084 # Hence the &quot;02:00&quot; of the 1980 law refers to standard time, not

1116 # From Paul Eggert (2017-12-10):
1117 # Greenland joined the European Communities as part of Denmark,
1118 # obtained home rule on 1979-05-01, and left the European Communities
1119 # on 1985-02-01.  It therefore should have been using EU
1120 # rules at least through 1984.  Shanks &amp; Pottenger say Scoresbysund and Godthåb
1121 # used C-Eur rules after 1980, but IATA SSIM (1991/1996) says they use EU

1124 # From Gwillim Law (2001-06-06), citing
1125 # &lt;http://www.statkart.no/efs/efshefter/2001/efs5-2001.pdf&gt; (2001-03-15),
1126 # and with translations corrected by Steffen Thorsen:
1127 #
1128 # Greenland has four local times, and the relation to UTC
1129 # is according to the following time line:
1130 #
1131 # The military zone near Thule	UTC-4
1132 # Standard Greenland time	UTC-3
1133 # Scoresbysund			UTC-1
1134 # Danmarkshavn			UTC
1135 #
1136 # In the military area near Thule and in Danmarkshavn DST will not be
1137 # introduced.
1138 
1139 # From Rives McDow (2001-11-01):
1140 #
1141 # I correspond regularly with the Dansk Polarcenter, and wrote them at
1142 # the time to clarify the situation in Thule.  Unfortunately, I have
1143 # not heard back from them regarding my recent letter.  [But I have
1144 # info from earlier correspondence.]
1145 #
1146 # According to the center, a very small local time zone around Thule
1147 # Air Base keeps the time according to UTC-4, implementing daylight
1148 # savings using North America rules, changing the time at 02:00 local time....
1149 #
1150 # The east coast of Greenland north of the community of Scoresbysund
1151 # uses UTC in the same way as in Iceland, year round, with no dst.
1152 # There are just a few stations on this coast, including the
1153 # Danmarkshavn ICAO weather station mentioned in your September 29th
1154 # email.  The other stations are two sledge patrol stations in
1155 # Mestersvig and Daneborg, the air force base at Station Nord, and the
1156 # DPC research station at Zackenberg.
1157 #
1158 # Scoresbysund and two small villages nearby keep time UTC-1 and use
1159 # the same daylight savings time period as in West Greenland (Godthåb).
1160 #
1161 # The rest of Greenland, including Godthåb (this area, although it
1162 # includes central Greenland, is known as west Greenland), keeps time
1163 # UTC-3, with daylight savings methods according to European rules.
1164 #
1165 # It is common procedure to use UTC 0 in the wilderness of East and
1166 # North Greenland, because it is mainly Icelandic aircraft operators
1167 # maintaining traffic in these areas.  However, the official status of
1168 # this area is that it sticks with Godthåb time.  This area might be
1169 # considered a dual time zone in some respects because of this.
1170 
1171 # From Rives McDow (2001-11-19):
1172 # I heard back from someone stationed at Thule; the time change took place
1173 # there at 2:00 AM.
1174 
1175 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
1176 # From 1997 on the CIA map shows Danmarkshavn on GMT;
1177 # the 1995 map as like Godthåb.
1178 # For lack of better info, assume they were like Godthåb before 1996.
1179 # startkart.no says Thule does not observe DST, but this is clearly an error,
1180 # so go with Shanks &amp; Pottenger for Thule transitions until this year.
1181 # For 2007 on assume Thule will stay in sync with US DST rules.

1284 # Well, here in Helsinki we&#39;re just changing from summer time to regular one,
1285 # and it&#39;s supposed to change at 4am...
1286 
1287 # From Janne Snabb (2010-07-15):
1288 #
1289 # I noticed that the Finland data is not accurate for years 1981 and 1982.
1290 # During these two first trial years the DST adjustment was made one hour
1291 # earlier than in forthcoming years. Starting 1983 the adjustment was made
1292 # according to the central European standards.
1293 #
1294 # This is documented in Heikki Oja: Aikakirja 2007, published by The Almanac

1577 # This material is paraphrased from the 1988 edition of the University of
1578 # Iceland Almanak.
1579 #
1580 # From January 1st, 1908 the whole of Iceland was standardised at 1 hour
1581 # behind GMT. Previously, local mean solar time was used in different parts
1582 # of Iceland, the almanak had been based on Reykjavík mean solar time which
1583 # was 1 hour and 28 minutes behind GMT.
1584 #
1585 # &quot;first day of winter&quot; referred to [below] means the first day of the 26 weeks
1586 # of winter, according to the old icelandic calendar that dates back to the
1587 # time the norsemen first settled Iceland.  The first day of winter is always
1588 # Saturday, but is not dependent on the Julian or Gregorian calendars.
1589 #
1590 # (1993-12-10):
1591 # I have a reference from the Oxford Icelandic-English dictionary for the
1592 # beginning of winter, which ties it to the ecclesiastical calendar (and thus
1593 # to the julian/gregorian calendar) over the period in question.
1594 #	the winter begins on the Saturday next before St. Luke&#39;s day
1595 #	(old style), or on St. Luke&#39;s day, if a Saturday.
1596 # St. Luke&#39;s day ought to be traceable from ecclesiastical sources. &quot;old style&quot;
1597 # might be a reference to the Julian calendar as opposed to Gregorian, or it
1598 # might mean something else (???).

1630 #
1631 # From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
1632 # Sicily and Sardinia each had their own time zones from 1866 to 1893,
1633 # called Palermo Time (+00:53:28) and Cagliari Time (+00:36:32).
1634 # During World War II, German-controlled Italy used German time.
1635 # But these events all occurred before the 1970 cutoff,
1636 # so record only the time in Rome.
1637 #
1638 # From Stephen Trainor (2019-05-06):
1639 # http://www.ac-ilsestante.it/MERIDIANE/ora_legale/ORA_LEGALE_ESTIVA_IN_ITALIA.htm
1640 # ... the [1866] law went into effect on 12 December 1866, rather than
1641 # the date of the decree (22 Sep 1866)
1642 # https://web.archive.org/web/20070824155341/http://www.iav.it/planetario/didastro/didastro/english.htm
1643 # ... &quot;In Italy in 1866 there were 6 railway times (Torino, Verona, Firenze,
1644 # Roma, Napoli, Palermo). On that year it was decided to unify them, adopting
1645 # the average time of Rome (even if this city was not yet part of the
1646 # kingdom).  On the 12th December 1866, on the starting of the winter time
1647 # table, it took effect in the railways, the post office and the telegraph,
1648 # not only for the internal service but also for the public....  Milano set
1649 # the public watches on the Rome time on the same day (12th December 1866),
1650 # Torino and Bologna on the 1st January 1867, Venezia the 1st May 1880 and the
1651 # last city was Cagliari in 1886.&quot;

1656 #
1657 # From Michael Deckers (2016-10-24):
1658 # http://www.ac-ilsestante.it/MERIDIANE/ora_legale quotes a law of 1893-08-10
1659 # ... [translated as] &quot;The preceding dispositions will enter into
1660 # force at the instant at which, according to the time specified in
1661 # the 1st article, the 1st of November 1893 will begin....&quot;
1662 #
1663 # From Pierpaolo Bernardi (2016-10-20):
1664 # The authoritative source for time in Italy is the national metrological
1665 # institute, which has a summary page of historical DST data at
1666 # http://www.inrim.it/res/tf/ora_legale_i.shtml
1667 # [now at http://oldsite.inrim.it/res/tf/ora_legale_i.shtml as of 2017]
1668 # (2016-10-24):
1669 # http://www.renzobaldini.it/le-ore-legali-in-italia/
1670 # has still different data for 1944.  It divides Italy in two, as
1671 # there were effectively two governments at the time, north of Gothic
1672 # Line German controlled territory, official government RSI, and south
1673 # of the Gothic Line, controlled by allied armies.
1674 #
1675 # From Brian Inglis (2016-10-23):
1676 # Viceregal LEGISLATIVE DECREE. 14 September 1944, no. 219.
1677 # Restoration of Standard Time. (044U0219) (OJ 62 of 30.9.1944) ...
1678 # Given the R. law decreed on 1944-03-29, no. 92, by which standard time is
1679 # advanced to sixty minutes later starting at hour two on 1944-04-02; ...
1680 # Starting at hour three on the date 1944-09-17 standard time will be resumed.
1681 #
1682 # From Alois Triendl (2019-07-02):
1683 # I spent 6 Euros to buy two archive copies of Il Messaggero, a Roman paper,
1684 # for 1 and 2 April 1944.  The edition of 2 April has this note: &quot;Tonight at 2
1685 # am, put forward the clock by one hour.  Remember that in the night between
1686 # today and Monday the &#39;ora legale&#39; will come in force again.&quot;  That makes it
1687 # clear that in Rome the change was on Monday, 3 April 1944 at 2 am.
1688 #
1689 # From Paul Eggert (2016-10-27):
1690 # Go with INRiM for DST rules, except as corrected by Inglis for 1944
1691 # for the Kingdom of Italy.  This is consistent with Renzo Baldini.
1692 # Model Rome&#39;s occupation by using C-Eur rules from 1943-09-10
1693 # to 1944-06-04; although Rome was an open city during this period, it
1694 # was effectively controlled by Germany.

1958 # http://lex.justice.md/viewdoc.php?action=view&amp;view=doc&amp;id=298782&amp;lang=2
1959 # ... says that since 1990-05-06 on the territory of the Moldavian SSR
1960 # time would be calculated as the standard time of the second time belt
1961 # plus one hour of the &quot;summer&quot; time. To implement that clocks would be

1963 # time would be cancelled last Sunday of September at 3:00 and
1964 # reintroduced last Sunday of March at 2:00.
1965 
1966 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
1967 # A previous version of this database followed Shanks &amp; Pottenger, who write
1968 # that Tiraspol switched to Moscow time on 1992-01-19 at 02:00.
1969 # However, this is most likely an error, as Moldova declared independence
1970 # on 1991-08-27 (the 1992-01-19 date is that of a Russian decree).
1971 # In early 1992 there was large-scale interethnic violence in the area
1972 # and it&#39;s possible that some Russophones continued to observe Moscow time.
1973 # But [two people] separately reported via

1975 # The Tiraspol entry has therefore been removed for now.

2045 # Howse writes that the Netherlands&#39; railways used GMT between 1892 and 1940,
2046 # but for other purposes the Netherlands used Amsterdam mean time.
2047 
2048 # However, Robert H. van Gent writes (2001-04-01):
2049 # Howse&#39;s statement is only correct up to 1909. From 1909-05-01 (00:00:00
2050 # Amsterdam mean time) onwards, the whole of the Netherlands (including
2051 # the Dutch railways) was required by law to observe Amsterdam mean time
2052 # (19 minutes 32.13 seconds ahead of GMT). This had already been the
2053 # common practice (except for the railways) for many decades but it was
2054 # not until 1909 when the Dutch government finally defined this by law.
2055 # On 1937-07-01 this was changed to 20 minutes (exactly) ahead of GMT and
2056 # was generally known as Dutch Time (&quot;Nederlandse Tijd&quot;).
2057 #
2058 # (2001-04-08):
2059 # 1892-05-01 was the date when the Dutch railways were by law required to
2060 # observe GMT while the remainder of the Netherlands adhered to the common
2061 # practice of following Amsterdam mean time.
2062 #
2063 # (2001-04-09):
2064 # In 1835 the authorities of the province of North Holland requested the
2065 # municipal authorities of the towns and cities in the province to observe
2066 # Amsterdam mean time but I do not know in how many cases this request was
2067 # actually followed.
2068 #
2069 # From 1852 onwards the Dutch telegraph offices were by law required to
2070 # observe Amsterdam mean time. As the time signals from the observatory of
2071 # Leiden were also distributed by the telegraph system, I assume that most
2072 # places linked up with the telegraph (and railway) system automatically
2073 # adopted Amsterdam mean time.
2074 #
2075 # Although the early Dutch railway companies initially observed a variety
2076 # of times, most of them had adopted Amsterdam mean time by 1858 but it
2077 # was not until 1866 when they were all required by law to observe
2078 # Amsterdam mean time.

2135 # Svalbard &amp; Jan Mayen
2136 
2137 # From Steffen Thorsen (2001-05-01):
2138 # Although I could not find it explicitly, it seems that Jan Mayen and
2139 # Svalbard have been using the same time as Norway at least since the
2140 # time they were declared as parts of Norway.  Svalbard was declared
2141 # as a part of Norway by law of 1925-07-17 no 11, section 4 and Jan
2142 # Mayen by law of 1930-02-27 no 2, section 2. (From
2143 # &lt;http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19250717-011.html&gt; and
2144 # &lt;http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19300227-002.html&gt;).  The law/regulation
2145 # for normal/standard time in Norway is from 1894-06-29 no 1 (came
2146 # into operation on 1895-01-01) and Svalbard/Jan Mayen seem to be a
2147 # part of this law since 1925/1930. (From
2148 # &lt;http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-18940629-001.html&gt;) I have not been
2149 # able to find if Jan Mayen used a different time zone (e.g. -0100)
2150 # before 1930. Jan Mayen has only been &quot;inhabited&quot; since 1921 by
2151 # Norwegian meteorologists and maybe used the same time as Norway ever
2152 # since 1921.  Svalbard (Arctic/Longyearbyen) has been inhabited since
2153 # before 1895, and therefore probably changed the local time somewhere
2154 # between 1895 and 1925 (inclusive).
2155 
2156 # From Paul Eggert (2013-09-04):
2157 #
2158 # Actually, Jan Mayen was never occupied by Germany during World War II,
2159 # so it must have diverged from Oslo time during the war, as Oslo was
2160 # keeping Berlin time.
2161 #
2162 # &lt;https://www.jan-mayen.no/history.htm&gt; says that the meteorologists
2163 # burned down their station in 1940 and left the island, but returned in
2164 # 1941 with a small Norwegian garrison and continued operations despite
2165 # frequent air attacks from Germans.  In 1943 the Americans established a
2166 # radiolocating station on the island, called &quot;Atlantic City&quot;.  Possibly
2167 # the UT offset changed during the war, but I think it unlikely that
2168 # Jan Mayen used German daylight-saving rules.
2169 #
2170 # Svalbard is more complicated, as it was raided in August 1941 by an
2171 # Allied party that evacuated the civilian population to England (says
2172 # &lt;http://www.bartleby.com/65/sv/Svalbard.html&gt;).  The Svalbard FAQ
2173 # &lt;http://www.svalbard.com/SvalbardFAQ.html&gt; says that the Germans were
2174 # expelled on 1942-05-14.  However, small parties of Germans did return,
2175 # and according to Wilhelm Dege&#39;s book &quot;War North of 80&quot; (1954)
2176 # http://www.ucalgary.ca/UofC/departments/UP/1-55238/1-55238-110-2.html
2177 # the German armed forces at the Svalbard weather station code-named
2178 # Haudegen did not surrender to the Allies until September 1945.
2179 #

2232 # From Paul Eggert (2014-08-11), after a heads-up from Stephen Colebourne:
2233 # According to a Portuguese decree (1911-05-26)
2234 # https://dre.pt/application/dir/pdf1sdip/1911/05/12500/23132313.pdf
2235 # Lisbon was at -0:36:44.68, but switched to GMT on 1912-01-01 at 00:00.
2236 # Round the old offset to -0:36:45.  This agrees with Willett....
2237 #
2238 # From Michael Deckers (2018-02-15):
2239 # article 5 [of the 1911 decree; Deckers&#39;s translation] ...:
2240 # These dispositions shall enter into force at the instant at which,
2241 # according to the 2nd article, the civil day January 1, 1912 begins,
2242 # all clocks therefore having to be advanced or set back correspondingly ...
2243 
2244 # From Rui Pedro Salgueiro (1992-11-12):
2245 # Portugal has recently (September, 27) changed timezone
2246 # (from WET to MET or CET) to harmonize with EEC.
2247 #
2248 # Martin Bruckmann (1996-02-29) reports via Peter Ilieve
2249 # that Portugal is reverting to 0:00 by not moving its clocks this spring.
2250 # The new Prime Minister was fed up with getting up in the dark in the winter.
2251 #
2252 # From Paul Eggert (1996-11-12):
2253 # IATA SSIM (1991-09) reports several 1991-09 and 1992-09 transitions
2254 # at 02:00u, not 01:00u.  Assume that these are typos.
2255 # IATA SSIM (1991/1992) reports that the Azores were at -1:00.
2256 # IATA SSIM (1993-02) says +0:00; later issues (through 1996-09) say -1:00.
2257 # Guess that the Azores changed to EU rules in 1992 (since that&#39;s when Portugal
2258 # harmonized with EU rules), and that they stayed +0:00 that winter.

2468 # Moscow time zone abbreviations after 1919-07-01, and Moscow rules after 1991,
2469 # are from Andrey A. Chernov.  The rest is from Shanks &amp; Pottenger,
2470 # except we follow Chernov&#39;s report that 1992 DST transitions were Sat
2471 # 23:00, not Sun 02:00s.
2472 #
2473 # From Stanislaw A. Kuzikowski (1994-06-29):
2474 # But now it is some months since Novosibirsk is 3 hours ahead of Moscow!
2475 # I do not know why they have decided to make this change;
2476 # as far as I remember it was done exactly during winter-&gt;summer switching
2477 # so we (Novosibirsk) simply did not switch.
2478 #
2479 # From Andrey A. Chernov (1996-10-04):
2480 # &#39;MSK&#39; and &#39;MSD&#39; were born and used initially on Moscow computers with
2481 # UNIX-like OSes by several developer groups (e.g. Demos group, Kiae group)....
2482 # The next step was the UUCP network, the Relcom predecessor
2483 # (used mainly for mail), and MSK/MSD was actively used there.
2484 #
2485 # From Chris Carrier (1996-10-30):
2486 # According to a friend of mine who rode the Trans-Siberian Railroad from
2487 # Moscow to Irkutsk in 1995, public air and rail transport in Russia ...
2488 # still follows Moscow time, no matter where in Russia it is located.
2489 #
2490 # For Grozny, Chechnya, we have the following story from
2491 # John Daniszewski, &quot;Scavengers in the Rubble&quot;, Los Angeles Times (2001-02-07):
2492 # News - often false - is spread by word of mouth.  A rumor that it was
2493 # time to move the clocks back put this whole city out of sync with
2494 # the rest of Russia for two weeks - even soldiers stationed here began
2495 # enforcing curfew at the wrong time.
2496 #
2497 # From Gwillim Law (2001-06-05):
2498 # There&#39;s considerable evidence that Sakhalin Island used to be in
2499 # UTC+11, and has changed to UTC+10, in this decade.  I start with the
2500 # SSIM, which listed Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in zone RU10 along with Magadan
2501 # until February 1997, and then in RU9 with Khabarovsk and Vladivostok
2502 # since September 1997....  Although the Kuril Islands are
2503 # administratively part of Sakhalin oblast&#39;, they appear to have
2504 # remained on UTC+11 along with Magadan.

2523 # says that the 1956 decision to change time belts&#39; borders was not
2524 # implemented as planned in 1956 and the change happened in 1957.
2525 # There is also the problem that actual time zones were different from
2526 # the official time belts (and from many time belts&#39; maps) as there were
2527 # numerous exceptions to application of time belt rules.  For example,
2528 # https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Московское_время#Перемещение_границы_применения_московского_времени_на_восток

3459 # As this source says that historical time in the Canaries is obscure,

3461 #
3462 # In the 1918 and 1919 fallback transitions in Spain, the clock for
3463 # the hour-longer day officially kept going after midnight, so that
3464 # the repeated instances of that day&#39;s 00:00 hour were 24 hours apart,
3465 # with a fallback transition from the second occurrence of 00:59... to
3466 # the next day&#39;s 00:00.  Our data format cannot represent this
3467 # directly, and instead repeats the first hour of the next day, with a

3558 # From Ivan Nilsson (2001-04-13), superseding Shanks &amp; Pottenger:
3559 #
3560 # The law &quot;Svensk författningssamling 1878, no 14&quot; about standard time in 1879:
3561 # From the beginning of 1879 (that is 01-01 00:00) the time for all
3562 # places in the country is &quot;the mean solar time for the meridian at
3563 # three degrees, or twelve minutes of time, to the west of the
3564 # meridian of the Observatory of Stockholm&quot;.  The law is dated 1878-05-31.
3565 #
3566 # The observatory at that time had the meridian 18° 03&#39; 30&quot;
3567 # eastern longitude = 01:12:14 in time.  Less 12 minutes gives the
3568 # national standard time as 01:00:14 ahead of GMT....
3569 #
3570 # About the beginning of CET in Sweden. The lawtext (&quot;Svensk
3571 # författningssamling 1899, no 44&quot;) states, that &quot;from the beginning
3572 # of 1900... ... the same as the mean solar time for the meridian at
3573 # the distance of one hour of time from the meridian of the English
3574 # observatory at Greenwich, or at 12 minutes 14 seconds to the west
3575 # from the meridian of the Observatory of Stockholm&quot;. The law is dated
3576 # 1899-06-16.  In short: At 1900-01-01 00:00:00 the new standard time
3577 # in Sweden is 01:00:00 ahead of GMT.
3578 #
3579 # 1916: The lawtext (&quot;Svensk författningssamling 1916, no 124&quot;) states
3580 # that &quot;1916-05-15 is considered to begin one hour earlier&quot;. It is
3581 # pretty obvious that at 05-14 23:00 the clocks are set to 05-15 00:00....
3582 # Further the law says, that &quot;1916-09-30 is considered to end one hour later&quot;.
3583 #
3584 # The laws regulating [DST] are available on the site of the Swedish

3623 # From Alois Treindl (2008-12-17):
3624 # I have researched the DST usage in Switzerland during the 1940ies.
3625 #
3626 # As I wrote in an earlier message, I suspected the current tzdata values
3627 # to be wrong. This is now verified.
3628 #
3629 # I have found copies of the original ruling by the Swiss Federal
3630 # government, in &#39;Eidgenössische Gesetzessammlung 1941 and 1942&#39; (Swiss
3631 # federal law collection)...
3632 #
3633 # DST began on Monday 5 May 1941, 1:00 am by shifting the clocks to 2:00 am
3634 # DST ended on Monday 6 Oct 1941, 2:00 am by shifting the clocks to 1:00 am.
3635 #
3636 # DST began on Monday, 4 May 1942 at 01:00 am
3637 # DST ended on Monday, 5 Oct 1942 at 02:00 am
3638 #
3639 # There was no DST in 1940, I have checked the law collection carefully.
3640 # It is also indicated by the fact that the 1942 entry in the law
3641 # collection points back to 1941 as a reference, but no reference to any
3642 # other years are made.
3643 #
3644 # Newspaper articles I have read in the archives on 6 May 1941 reported
3645 # about the introduction of DST (Sommerzeit in German) during the previous
3646 # night as an absolute novelty, because this was the first time that such
3647 # a thing had happened in Switzerland.
3648 #
3649 # I have also checked 1916, because one book source (Gabriel, Traité de
3650 # l&#39;heure dans le monde) claims that Switzerland had DST in 1916. This is
3651 # false, no official document could be found. Probably Gabriel got misled
3652 # by references to Germany, which introduced DST in 1916 for the first time.
3653 #
3654 # The tzdata rules for Switzerland must be changed to:
3655 # Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       May     Mon&gt;=1  1:00    1:00    S
3656 # Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       Oct     Mon&gt;=1  2:00    0       -
3657 #
3658 # The 1940 rules must be deleted.
3659 #
3660 # One further detail for Switzerland, which is probably out of scope for
3661 # most users of tzdata: The [Europe/Zurich zone] ...
3662 # describes all of Switzerland correctly, with the exception of
3663 # the Canton de Genève (Geneva, Genf). Between 1848 and 1894 Geneva did not
3664 # follow Bern Mean Time but kept its own local mean time.
3665 # To represent this, an extra zone would be needed.
3666 #
3667 # From Alois Treindl (2013-09-11):
3668 # The Federal regulations say
3669 # https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20071096/index.html
3670 # ... the meridian for Bern mean time ... is 7° 26&#39; 22.50&quot;.
3671 # Expressed in time, it is 0h29m45.5s.

3675 # http://www.amtsdruckschriften.bar.admin.ch/viewOrigDoc.do?id=10071353

3689 #
3690 # suggests that the transition was more gradual, and that the Swiss did not
3691 # agree about civil time during the transition.  The timekeeping it gives the
3692 # most detail for is postal and telegraph time: here, federal legislation (the

3694 # 1851-11-23, and an official implementation notice was published 1853-07-16
3695 # (Bundesblatt 1853, Bd. II, S. 859).  On p 72 Messerli writes that in
3696 # practice since July 1853 Bernese time was used in &quot;all postal and telegraph
3697 # offices in Switzerland from Geneva to St. Gallen and Basel to Chiasso&quot;
3698 # (Google translation).  For now, model this transition as occurring on
3699 # 1853-07-16, though it probably occurred at some other date in Zurich, and

3749 # to +3.  This is published &amp; applied on 1978-06-29.  At that time, Turkey was
3750 # already on summer time (already on 45E).  Hence, this new law just meant an
3751 # &quot;continuous summer time&quot;.  Note that this was reversed in a few years.

3989 # transliteration of the Ukrainian &quot;Київ&quot;.  This is similar to tzdb&#39;s use of

3991 # &quot;Praha&quot;.  (&quot;Kiev&quot; came from old Slavic via Russian to English, and &quot;Prague&quot;
3992 # came from old Slavic via French to English, so the two cases have something

4042 # One source shows that Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, and Greece observe DST from
4043 # the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in September in 1986.
4044 # The source shows Romania changing a day later than everybody else.
4045 #
4046 # According to Bernard Sieloff&#39;s source, Poland is in the MET time zone but
4047 # uses the WE DST rules.  The Western USSR uses EET+1 and ME DST rules.
4048 # Bernard Sieloff&#39;s source claims Romania switches on the same day, but at
4049 # 00:00 standard time (i.e., 01:00 DST).  It also claims that Turkey
4050 # switches on the same day, but switches on at 01:00 standard time
4051 # and off at 00:00 standard time (i.e., 01:00 DST)

4058 # ...the European time rules are...standardized since 1981, when
4059 # most European countries started DST.  Before that year, only
4060 # a few countries (UK, France, Italy) had DST, each according
4061 # to own national rules.  In 1981, however, DST started on
4062 # &#39;Apr firstSun&#39;, and not on &#39;Mar lastSun&#39; as in the following
4063 # years...
4064 # But also since 1981 there are some more national exceptions
4065 # than listed in &#39;europe&#39;: Switzerland, for example, joined DST
4066 # one year later, Denmark ended DST on &#39;Oct 1&#39; instead of &#39;Sep
4067 # lastSun&#39; in 1981 - I don&#39;t know how they handle now.
4068 #
4069 # Finally, DST ist always from &#39;Apr 1&#39; to &#39;Oct 1&#39; in the
4070 # Soviet Union (as far as I know).

4080 #
4081 # The information from Tom Hofmann is (as far as I know) not entirely correct.
4082 # After a request from chongo at amdahl I tried to retrieve all information
4083 # about DST in Europe.  I was able to find all from about 1969.
4084 #
4085 # ...standardization on DST in Europe started in about 1977 with switches on
4086 # first Sunday in April and last Sunday in September...
4087 # In 1981 UK joined Europe insofar that
4088 # the starting day for both shifted to last Sunday in March.  And from 1982
4089 # the whole of Europe used DST, with switch dates April 1 and October 1 in
4090 # the Sov[i]et Union.  In 1985 the SU reverted to standard Europe[a]n switch
4091 # dates...
4092 #
4093 # It should also be remembered that time-zones are not constants; e.g.
4094 # Portugal switched in 1976 from MET (or CET) to WET with DST...
4095 # Note also that though there were rules for switch dates not
4096 # all countries abided to these dates, and many individual deviations
4097 # occurred, though not since 1982 I believe.  Another note: it is always
4098 # assumed that DST is 1 hour ahead of normal time, this need not be the
4099 # case; at least in the Netherlands there have been times when DST was 2 hours
4100 # in advance of normal time.
