 114 # Shanks says that DST was called &quot;War Time&quot; in the US in 1918 and 1919.
 115 # However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which
 116 # was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently
 117 # time was just called &quot;Standard Time&quot; or &quot;Daylight Saving Time&quot;.

 120 # Here is the legal basis for the US federal rules.
 121 # * Public Law 65-106 (1918-03-19) implemented standard and daylight saving
