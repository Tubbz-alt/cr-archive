<span class="line-added">+ # From Phake Nick (2020-04-15):</span>
<span class="line-added">+ #</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # For the history of time in Shanghai between 1940-1942, the situation is</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # actually slightly more complex than the table [below]....  At the time,</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # there were three different authorities in Shanghai, including Shanghai</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # International Settlement, a settlement established by western countries with</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # its own westernized form of government, Shanghai French Concession, similar</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # to the international settlement but is controlled by French, and then the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # rest of the city of Shanghai, which have already been controlled by Japanese</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # force through a puppet local government (Wang Jingwei regime).  It was</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # additionally complicated by the circumstances that, according to the 1940s</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # Shanghai summer time essay cited in the database, some</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # departments/businesses/people in the Shanghai city itself during that time</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # period, refused to change their clock and instead only changed their opening</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # hours.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ #</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # For example, as quoted in the article, in 1940, other than the authority</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # itself, power, tram, bus companies, cinema, department stores, and other</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # public service organizations have all decided to follow the summer time and</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # spring forward the clock.  On the other hand, the custom office refused to</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # spring forward the clock because of worry on mechanical wear to the physical</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # clock, postal office refused to spring forward because of disruption to</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # business and log-keeping, although they did changed their office hour to</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # match rest of the city.  So is travel agents, and also weather</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # observatory.  It is said both time standards had their own supporters in the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # city at the time, those who prefer new time standard would have moved their</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # clock while those who prefer the old time standard would keep their clock</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # unchange, and there were different clocks that use different time standard</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # in the city at the time for people who use different time standard to adjust</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # their clock to their preferred time.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ #</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # a. For the 1940 May 31 spring forward, the essay claim that it was</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # coordinared between the international settlement authority and the French</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # concession authority and have gathered support from Hong Kong and Xiamen,</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # that it would spring forward an hour from May 31 &quot;midnight&quot;, and the essay</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # claim &quot;Hong Kong government implemented the spring forward in the same time</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # on the same date as Shanghai&quot;.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ #</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # b. For the 1940 fall back, it was said that they initially intended to do</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # so on September 30 00:59 at night, however they postponed it to October 12</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # after discussion with relevant parties. However schools restored to the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # original schedule ten days earlier.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ #</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # c. For the 1941 spring forward, it is said to start from March 15</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # &quot;following the previous year&#39;s method&quot;, and in addition to that the essay</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # cited an announcement in 1941 from the Wang regime which said the Special</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # City of Shanghai under Wang regime control will follow the DST rule set by</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # the Settlements, irrespective of the original DST plan announced by the Wang</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # regime for other area under its control(April 1 to September 30). (no idea</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # to situation before that announcement)</span>
<span class="line-added">+ #</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # d. For the 1941 fall back, it was said that the fall back would occurs at</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # the end of September (A newspaper headline cited by the essay, published on</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # October 1, 1941, have the headlines which said &quot;French Concession would</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # rewind to the old clock this morning), but it ultimately didn&#39;t happen due</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # to disagreement between the international settlement authority and the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # French concession authority, and the fall back ultimately occurred on</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # November 1.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ #</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # e. In 1941 December, Japan have officially started war with the United</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # States and the United Kingdom, and in Shanghai they have marched into the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # international settlement, taken over its control</span>
<span class="line-added">+ #</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # f. For the 1942 spring forward, the essay said that the spring forward</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # started on January 31. It said this time the custom office and postal</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # department will also change their clocks, unlike before.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ #</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # g. The essay itself didn&#39;t cover any specific changes thereafter until the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # end of the war, it quoted a November 1942 command from the government of the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # Wang regime, which claim the daylight saving time applies year round during</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # the war. However, the essay ambiguously said the period is &quot;February 1 to</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # September 30&quot;, which I don&#39;t really understand what is the meaning of such</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # period in the context of year round implementation here.. More researches</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # might be needed to show exactly what happened during that period of time.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ # From Phake Nick (2020-04-15):</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # According to a Japanese tour bus pamphlet in Nanjing area believed to be</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # from around year 1941: http://www.tt-museum.jp/tairiku_0280_nan1941.html ,</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # the schedule listed was in the format of Japanese time.  Which indicate some</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # use of the Japanese time (instead of syncing by DST) might have occurred in</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # the Yangtze river delta area during that period of time although the scope</span>
<span class="line-added">+ # of such use will need to be investigated to determine.</span>
