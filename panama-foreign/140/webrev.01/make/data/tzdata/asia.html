  41 # Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
  42 # for time zone data was the International Air Transport
  43 # Association&#39;s Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
  44 # published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
  45 # of the IATA&#39;s data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
  46 # IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.

  48 # Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
  49 # Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
  50 # I found in the UCLA library.

 341 
 342 # From Phake Nick (2020-04-15):
 343 #
 344 # For the history of time in Shanghai between 1940-1942, the situation is
 345 # actually slightly more complex than the table [below]....  At the time,
 346 # there were three different authorities in Shanghai, including Shanghai
 347 # International Settlement, a settlement established by western countries with
 348 # its own westernized form of government, Shanghai French Concession, similar
 349 # to the international settlement but is controlled by French, and then the
 350 # rest of the city of Shanghai, which have already been controlled by Japanese
 351 # force through a puppet local government (Wang Jingwei regime).  It was
 352 # additionally complicated by the circumstances that, according to the 1940s
 353 # Shanghai summer time essay cited in the database, some
 354 # departments/businesses/people in the Shanghai city itself during that time
 355 # period, refused to change their clock and instead only changed their opening
 356 # hours.
 357 #
 358 # For example, as quoted in the article, in 1940, other than the authority
 359 # itself, power, tram, bus companies, cinema, department stores, and other
 360 # public service organizations have all decided to follow the summer time and
 361 # spring forward the clock.  On the other hand, the custom office refused to
 362 # spring forward the clock because of worry on mechanical wear to the physical
 363 # clock, postal office refused to spring forward because of disruption to
 364 # business and log-keeping, although they did changed their office hour to
 365 # match rest of the city.  So is travel agents, and also weather
 366 # observatory.  It is said both time standards had their own supporters in the
 367 # city at the time, those who prefer new time standard would have moved their
 368 # clock while those who prefer the old time standard would keep their clock
 369 # unchange, and there were different clocks that use different time standard
 370 # in the city at the time for people who use different time standard to adjust
 371 # their clock to their preferred time.
 372 #
 373 # a. For the 1940 May 31 spring forward, the essay claim that it was
 374 # coordinared between the international settlement authority and the French
 375 # concession authority and have gathered support from Hong Kong and Xiamen,
 376 # that it would spring forward an hour from May 31 &quot;midnight&quot;, and the essay
 377 # claim &quot;Hong Kong government implemented the spring forward in the same time
 378 # on the same date as Shanghai&quot;.
 379 #
 380 # b. For the 1940 fall back, it was said that they initially intended to do
 381 # so on September 30 00:59 at night, however they postponed it to October 12
 382 # after discussion with relevant parties. However schools restored to the
 383 # original schedule ten days earlier.

 385 # c. For the 1941 spring forward, it is said to start from March 15
 386 # &quot;following the previous year&#39;s method&quot;, and in addition to that the essay
 387 # cited an announcement in 1941 from the Wang regime which said the Special
 388 # City of Shanghai under Wang regime control will follow the DST rule set by
 389 # the Settlements, irrespective of the original DST plan announced by the Wang
 390 # regime for other area under its control(April 1 to September 30). (no idea
 391 # to situation before that announcement)
 392 #
 393 # d. For the 1941 fall back, it was said that the fall back would occurs at
 394 # the end of September (A newspaper headline cited by the essay, published on
 395 # October 1, 1941, have the headlines which said &quot;French Concession would
 396 # rewind to the old clock this morning), but it ultimately didn&#39;t happen due
 397 # to disagreement between the international settlement authority and the
 398 # French concession authority, and the fall back ultimately occurred on
 399 # November 1.
 400 #
 401 # e. In 1941 December, Japan have officially started war with the United
 402 # States and the United Kingdom, and in Shanghai they have marched into the
 403 # international settlement, taken over its control
 404 #
 405 # f. For the 1942 spring forward, the essay said that the spring forward
 406 # started on January 31. It said this time the custom office and postal
 407 # department will also change their clocks, unlike before.
 408 #
 409 # g. The essay itself didn&#39;t cover any specific changes thereafter until the
 410 # end of the war, it quoted a November 1942 command from the government of the
 411 # Wang regime, which claim the daylight saving time applies year round during
 412 # the war. However, the essay ambiguously said the period is &quot;February 1 to
 413 # September 30&quot;, which I don&#39;t really understand what is the meaning of such
 414 # period in the context of year round implementation here.. More researches
 415 # might be needed to show exactly what happened during that period of time.

 418 # According to a Japanese tour bus pamphlet in Nanjing area believed to be
 419 # from around year 1941: http://www.tt-museum.jp/tairiku_0280_nan1941.html ,
 420 # the schedule listed was in the format of Japanese time.  Which indicate some
 421 # use of the Japanese time (instead of syncing by DST) might have occurred in
 422 # the Yangtze river delta area during that period of time although the scope
 423 # of such use will need to be investigated to determine.

 529 # A Study on the Standard Time Changes for the Past 100 Years in China
 530 # [undated and unknown publication location]
 531 # It says several things:
 532 #   * The Qing dynasty used local apparent solar time throughout China.
 533 #   * The Republic of China instituted Beijing mean solar time effective
 534 #     the official calendar book of 1914.
 535 #   * The French Concession in Shanghai set up signal stations in
 536 #     French docks in the 1890s, controlled by Xujiahui (Zikawei)
 537 #     Observatory and set to local mean time.
 538 #   * &quot;From the end of the 19th century&quot; it changed to UT+8.
 539 #   * Chinese Customs (by then reduced to a tool of foreign powers)
 540 #     eventually standardized on this time for all ports, and it
 541 #     became used by railways as well.
 542 #   * In 1918 the Central Observatory proposed dividing China into
 543 #     five time zones (see below for details).  This caught on
 544 #     at first only in coastal areas observing UT+8.
 545 #   * During WWII all of China was in theory was at UT+7.  In practice
 546 #     this was ignored in the west, and I presume was ignored in
 547 #     Japanese-occupied territory.
 548 #   * Japanese-occupied Manchuria was at UT+9, i.e., Japan time.
 549 #   * The five-zone plan was resurrected after WWII and officially put into
 550 #     place (with some modifications) in March 1948.  It&#39;s not clear
 551 #     how well it was observed in areas under Nationalist control.
 552 #   * The People&#39;s Liberation Army used UT+8 during the civil war.
 553 #
 554 # An AP article &quot;Shanghai Internat&#39;l Area Little Changed&quot; in the
 555 # Lewiston (ME) Daily Sun (1939-05-29), p 17, said &quot;Even the time is
 556 # different - the occupied districts going by Tokyo time, an hour
 557 # ahead of that prevailing in the rest of Shanghai.&quot;  Guess that the
 558 # Xujiahui Observatory was under French control and stuck with UT +08.
 559 #
 560 # In earlier versions of this file, China had many separate Zone entries, but
 561 # this was based on what were apparently incorrect data in Shanks &amp; Pottenger.
 562 # This has now been simplified to the two entries Asia/Shanghai and
 563 # Asia/Urumqi, with the others being links for backward compatibility.
 564 # Proposed in 1918 and theoretically in effect until 1949 (although in practice
 565 # mainly observed in coastal areas), the five zones were:
 566 #
 567 # Changbai Time (&quot;Long-white Time&quot;, Long-white = Heilongjiang area) UT +08:30
 568 # Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here.
 569 # Heilongjiang (except Mohe county), Jilin
 570 #

 572 # Now part of Asia/Shanghai.

 575 # Guo says Shanghai switched to UT +08 &quot;from the end of the 19th century&quot;.
 576 #
 577 # Long-shu Time (probably as Long and Shu were two names of the area) UT +07

 583 #
 584 # Xin-zang Time (&quot;Xinjiang-Tibet Time&quot;) UT +06

 604 # From Luther Ma (2009-10-17):
 605 # Almost all (&gt;99.9%) ethnic Chinese (properly ethnic Han) living in
 606 # Xinjiang use Chinese Standard Time. Some are aware of Xinjiang time,
 607 # but have no need of it. All planes, trains, and schools function on
 608 # what is called &quot;Beijing time.&quot; When Han make an appointment in Chinese
 609 # they implicitly use Beijing time.
 610 #
 611 # On the other hand, ethnic Uyghurs, who make up about half the
 612 # population of Xinjiang, typically use &quot;Xinjiang time&quot; which is two
 613 # hours behind Beijing time, or UT +06. The government of the Xinjiang
 614 # Uyghur Autonomous Region, (XAUR, or just Xinjiang for short) as well as
 615 # local governments such as the Ürümqi city government use both times in
 616 # publications, referring to what is popularly called Xinjiang time as
 617 # &quot;Ürümqi time.&quot; When Uyghurs make an appointment in the Uyghur language
 618 # they almost invariably use Xinjiang time.
 619 #
 620 # (Their ethnic Han compatriots would typically have no clue of its
 621 # widespread use, however, because so extremely few of them are fluent in
 622 # Uyghur, comparable to the number of Anglo-Americans fluent in Navajo.)
 623 #
 624 # (...As with the rest of China there was a brief interval ending in 1990
 625 # or 1991 when summer time was in use.  The confusion was severe, with
 626 # the province not having dual times but four times in use at the same
 627 # time. Some areas remained on standard Xinjiang time or Beijing time and
 628 # others moving their clocks ahead.)
 629 
 630 # From Luther Ma (2009-11-19):
 631 # With the risk of being redundant to previous answers these are the most common
 632 # English &quot;transliterations&quot; (w/o using non-English symbols):
 633 #
 634 # 1. Wulumuqi...
 635 # 2. Kashi...
 636 # 3. Urumqi...
 637 # 4. Kashgar...
 638 # ...
 639 # 5. It seems that Uyghurs in Ürümqi has been using Xinjiang since at least the
 640 # 1960&#39;s. I know of one Han, now over 50, who grew up in the surrounding
 641 # countryside and used Xinjiang time as a child.
 642 #
 643 # 6. Likewise for Kashgar and the rest of south Xinjiang I don&#39;t know of any
 644 # start date for Xinjiang time.
 645 #
 646 # Without having access to local historical records, nor the ability to legally
 647 # publish them, I would go with October 1, 1949, when Xinjiang became the Uyghur
 648 # Autonomous Region under the PRC. (Before that Uyghurs, of course, would also
 649 # not be using Beijing time, but some local time.)

 654 
 655 # From Luther Ma (2014-04-22):
 656 # I have interviewed numerous people of various nationalities and from
 657 # different localities in Xinjiang and can confirm the information in Guo&#39;s
 658 # report regarding Xinjiang, as well as the Time article reference by David
 659 # Cochrane.  Whether officially recognized or not (and both are officially
 660 # recognized), two separate times have been in use in Xinjiang since at least
 661 # the Cultural Revolution: Xinjiang Time (XJT), aka Ürümqi Time or local time;
 662 # and Beijing Time.  There is no confusion in Xinjiang as to which name refers
 663 # to which time. Both are widely used in the province, although in some
 664 # population groups might be use one to the exclusion of the other.  The only
 665 # problem is that computers and smart phones list Ürümqi (or Kashgar) as
 666 # having the same time as Beijing.
 667 
 668 # From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
 669 # In the early days of the PRC, Tibet was given its own time zone (UT +06)
 670 # but this was withdrawn in 1959 and never reinstated; see Tubten Khétsun,
 671 # Memories of life in Lhasa under Chinese Rule, Columbia U Press, ISBN
 672 # 978-0231142861 (2008), translator&#39;s introduction by Matthew Akester, p x.
 673 # As this is before our 1970 cutoff, Tibet doesn&#39;t need a separate zone.
 674 #
 675 # Xinjiang Time is well-documented as being officially recognized.  E.g., see
 676 # &quot;The Working-Calendar for The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government&quot;
 677 # &lt;http://www.sinkiang.gov.cn/service/ourworking/&gt; (2014-04-22).
 678 # Unfortunately, we have no good records of time in Xinjiang before 1986.
 679 # During the 20th century parts of Xinjiang were ruled by the Qing dynasty,
 680 # the Republic of China, various warlords, the First and Second East Turkestan
 681 # Republics, the Soviet Union, the Kuomintang, and the People&#39;s Republic of
 682 # China, and tracking down all these organizations&#39; timekeeping rules would be
 683 # quite a trick.  Approximate this lost history by a transition from LMT to
 684 # UT +06 at the start of 1928, the year of accession of the warlord Jin Shuren,
 685 # which happens to be the date given by Shanks &amp; Pottenger (no doubt as a
 686 # guess) as the transition from LMT.  Ignore the usage of +08 before
 687 # 1986-02-01 under the theory that the transition date to +08 is unknown and
 688 # that the sort of users who prefer Asia/Urumqi now typically ignored the
 689 # +08 mandate back then.

 751 # I went to check microfilm records stored at Hong Kong Public Library....
 752 # on September 30 1941, according to Ta Kung Pao (Hong Kong edition), it was
 753 # stated that fallback would occur on the next day (the 1st)&#39;s &quot;03:00 am (Hong
 754 # Kong Time 04:00 am)&quot; and the clock will fall back for a half hour. (03:00
 755 # probably refer to the time commonly used in mainland China at the time given
 756 # the paper&#39;s background) ... the sunrise/sunset time given by South China
 757 # Morning Post for October 1st was indeed moved by half an hour compares to
 758 # before.  After that, in December, the battle to capture Hong Kong started and
 759 # the library doesn&#39;t seems to have any record stored about press during that
 760 # period of time.  Some media resumed publication soon after that within the
 761 # same month, but there were not much information about time there.  Later they
 762 # started including a radio program guide when they restored radio service,
 763 # explicitly mentioning it use Tokyo standard time, and later added a note
 764 # saying it&#39;s half an hour ahead of the old Hong Kong standard time, and it
 765 # also seems to indicate that Hong Kong was not using GMT+8 when it was
 766 # captured by Japan.

 897 # Taiwan
 898 
 899 # From smallufo (2010-04-03):
 900 # According to Taiwan&#39;s CWB [Central Weather Bureau],
 901 # http://www.cwb.gov.tw/V6/astronomy/cdata/summert.htm
 902 # Taipei has DST in 1979 between July 1st and Sep 30.
 903 
 904 # From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2013-07-12):
 905 # On Dec 28, 1895, the Meiji Emperor announced Ordinance No. 167 of
 906 # Meiji Year 28 &quot;The clause about standard time&quot;, mentioned that
 907 # Taiwan and Penghu Islands, as well as Yaeyama and Miyako Islands
 908 # (both in Okinawa) adopt the Western Standard Time which is based on
 909 # 120E. The adoption began from Jan 1, 1896. The original text can be
 910 # found on Wikisource:
 911 # https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/標準時ニ關スル件_(公布時)
 912 # ... This could be the first adoption of time zone in Taiwan, because
 913 # during the Qing Dynasty, it seems that there was no time zone
 914 # declared officially.
 915 #
 916 # Later, in the beginning of World War II, on Sep 25, 1937, the Showa
 917 # Emperor announced Ordinance No. 529 of Showa Year 12 &quot;The clause of
 918 # revision in the ordinance No. 167 of Meiji year 28 about standard
 919 # time&quot;, in which abolished the adoption of Western Standard Time in
 920 # western islands (listed above), which means the whole Japan
 921 # territory, including later occupations, adopt Japan Central Time
 922 # (UT+9). The adoption began on Oct 1, 1937. The original text can
 923 # be found on Wikisource:
 924 # https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/明治二十八年勅令第百六十七號標準時ニ關スル件中改正ノ件
 925 #
 926 # That is, the time zone of Taipei switched to UT+9 on Oct 1, 1937.
 927 
 928 # From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):
 929 # I&#39;ve found more evidence about when the time zone was switched from UT+9
 930 # back to UT+8 after WW2.  I believe it was on Sep 21, 1945.  In a document
 931 # during Japanese era [1] in which the officer told the staff to change time
 932 # zone back to Western Standard Time (UT+8) on Sep 21.  And in another
 933 # history page of National Cheng Kung University [2], on Sep 21 there is a
 934 # note &quot;from today, switch back to Western Standard Time&quot;.  From these two
 935 # materials, I believe that the time zone change happened on Sep 21.  And
 936 # today I have found another monthly journal called &quot;The Astronomical Herald&quot;
 937 # from The Astronomical Society of Japan [3] in which it mentioned the fact
 938 # that:
 939 #
 940 # 1. Standard Time of the Country (Japan) was adopted on Jan 1, 1888, using
 941 # the time at 135E (GMT+9)
 942 #
 943 # 2. Standard Time of the Country was renamed to Central Standard Time, on Jan
 944 # 1, 1898, and on the same day, the new territories Taiwan and Penghu islands,
 945 # as well as Yaeyama and Miyako islands, adopted a new time zone called
 946 # Western Standard Time, which is in GMT+8.
 947 #
 948 # 3. Western Standard Time was deprecated on Sep 30, 1937. From then all the
 949 # territories of Japan adopted the same time zone, which is Central Standard
 950 # Time.

 962 # Bulletin No. 386 in Showa 20 years (1945), published on Sep 19, 1945. [1] ...
 963 # [It] abolishes Bulletin No. 207 in Showa 12 years (1937), which is a local
 964 # bulletin in Taiwan for that Ordinance No. 529. It also mentioned that 1am on
 965 # Sep 21, 1945 will be 12am on Sep 21.  I think this bulletin is much more
 966 # official than the one I mentioned in my first mail, because it&#39;s from the
 967 # top-level government in Taiwan. If you&#39;re going to quote any resource, this
 968 # would be a good one.

 983 # http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=0360310AKZ431
 984 #
 985 # Here is a brief translation:
 986 #
 987 #   The Summer Time this year is adopted from midnight Apr 15 until Sep 20
 988 #   midnight. To save (energy?) consumption, we&#39;re expanding Summer Time
 989 #   adoption till Oct 31 midnight.
 990 #
 991 # The Central Weather Bureau website didn&#39;t mention that, however it can

 993 
 994 # From Paul Eggert (2014-07-03):
 995 # As per Yu-Cheng Chuang, say that Taiwan was at UT +09 from 1937-10-01

1037 # Macau adopted GMT+8 on 30 Oct 1904 to follow Hong Kong.  Clocks were

1313 # &quot;A more potent cause of resistance to the general adoption of the present
1314 # standard time lies in the fact that it is Madras time.  The citizen of

1316 # his city being the Capital of India, and - for a part of the year - the Seat
1317 # of the Supreme Government, alike look down on Madras, and refuse to change
1318 # the time they are using, for that of what they regard as a benighted
1319 # Presidency; while Madras, having for long given the standard time to the
1320 # rest of India, would resist the adoption of any other Indian standard in its

1366 # http://www.sumatera-inc.com/go_to_invest/about_indonesia.asp#standtime
1367 # says that Indonesia&#39;s time zones changed on 1988-01-01.  Looking at some
1368 # time zone maps, I think that must refer to Western Borneo (Kalimantan Barat
1369 # and Kalimantan Tengah) switching from UTC+8 to UTC+7.
1370 #
1371 # From Paul Eggert (2007-03-10):
1372 # Here is another correction to Shanks &amp; Pottenger.
1373 # JohnTWB writes that Japanese forces did not surrender control in
1374 # Indonesia until 1945-09-01 00:00 at the earliest (in Jakarta) and
1375 # other formal surrender ceremonies were September 9, 11, and 13, plus
1376 # September 12 for the regional surrender to Mountbatten in Singapore.
1377 # These would be the earliest possible times for a change.
1378 # Régimes horaires pour le monde entier, by Henri Le Corre, (Éditions
1379 # Traditionnelles, 1987, Paris) says that Java and Madura switched
1380 # from UT +09 to +07:30 on 1945-09-23, and gives 1944-09-01 for Jayapura
1381 # (Hollandia).  For now, assume all Indonesian locations other than Jayapura
1382 # switched on 1945-09-23.
1383 #
1384 # From Paul Eggert (2013-08-11):
1385 # Normally the tz database uses English-language abbreviations, but in
1386 # Indonesia it&#39;s typical to use Indonesian-language abbreviations even
1387 # when writing in English.  For example, see the English-language
1388 # summary published by the Time and Frequency Laboratory of the
1389 # Research Center for Calibration, Instrumentation and Metrology,
1390 # Indonesia, &lt;http://time.kim.lipi.go.id/time-eng.php&gt; (2006-09-29).
1391 # The time zone abbreviations and UT offsets are:

1434 # From Roozbeh Pournader (2003-03-15):
1435 # This is an English translation of what I just found (originally in Persian).
1436 # The Gregorian dates in brackets are mine:
1437 #
1438 #	Official Newspaper No. 13548-1370/6/25 [1991-09-16]
1439 #	No. 16760/T233 H				1370/6/10 [1991-09-01]
1440 #
1441 #	The Rule About Change of the Official Time of the Country
1442 #
1443 #	The Board of Ministers, in the meeting dated 1370/5/23 [1991-08-14],
1444 #	based on the suggestion number 2221/D dated 1370/4/22 [1991-07-13]
1445 #	of the Country&#39;s Organization for Official and Employment Affairs,
1446 #	and referring to the law for equating the working hours of workers
1447 #	and officers in the whole country dated 1359/4/23 [1980-07-14], and
1448 #	for synchronizing the official times of the country, agreed that:
1449 #
1450 #	The official time of the country will should move forward one hour
1451 #	at the 24[:00] hours of the first day of Farvardin and should return
1452 #	to its previous state at the 24[:00] hours of the 30th day of
1453 #	Shahrivar.
1454 #
1455 #	First Deputy to the President - Hassan Habibi
1456 #
1457 # From personal experience, that agrees with what has been followed
1458 # for at least the last 5 years.  Before that, for a few years, the
1459 # date used was the first Thursday night of Farvardin and the last
1460 # Thursday night of Shahrivar, but I can&#39;t give exact dates....
1461 #
1462 # From Roozbeh Pournader (2005-04-05):
1463 # The text of the Iranian law, in effect since 1925, clearly mentions
1464 # that the true solar year is the measure, and there is no arithmetic
1465 # leap year calculation involved.  There has never been any serious
1466 # plan to change that law....
1467 #
1468 # From Paul Eggert (2018-11-30):
1469 # Go with Shanks &amp; Pottenger before Sept. 1991, and with Pournader thereafter.
1470 # I used the following code in GNU Emacs 26.1 to generate the &quot;Rule Iran&quot;
1471 # lines from 2008 through 2087.  Emacs 26.1 uses Ed Reingold&#39;s
1472 # cal-persia implementation of Birashk&#39;s approximation, which in the
1473 # 2008-2087 range disagrees with the astronomical Persian calendar
1474 # for Persian years 1404 (Gregorian 2025) and 1437 (Gregorian 2058), so
1475 # the following code special-cases those years.  See Table 15.1, page 264, of:

1479 # Page 258, footnote 2, of this book says there is some dispute over what will
1480 # happen in 2091 (and some other years after that), so this code

1528 # From Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-03-30), writing about future
1529 # discrepancies between cal-persia and the Iranian calendar:
1530 # For 2091 solar-longitude-after yields 2091-03-20 08:40:07.7 UT for
1531 # the vernal equinox and that gets so close to 12:00 some local
1532 # Iranian time that the definition of the correct location needs to be
1533 # known exactly, amongst other factors.  2157 is even closer:
1534 # 2157-03-20 08:37:15.5 UT.  But the Gregorian year 2025 should give
1535 # no interpretation problem whatsoever.  By the way, another instant
1536 # in the near future where there will be a discrepancy between
1537 # arithmetical and astronomical Iranian calendars will be in 2058:
1538 # vernal equinox on 2058-03-20 09:03:05.9 UT.  The Java version of
1539 # Reingold&#39;s/Dershowitz&#39; calculator gives correctly the Gregorian date
1540 # 2058-03-21 for 1 Farvardin 1437 (astronomical).

1679 # From Jonathan Lennox (2000-06-12):
1680 # An article in this week&#39;s Economist (&quot;Inside the Saddam-free zone&quot;, p. 50 in
1681 # the U.S. edition) on the Iraqi Kurds contains a paragraph:
1682 # &quot;The three northern provinces ... switched their clocks this spring and
1683 # are an hour ahead of Baghdad.&quot;
1684 #
1685 # But Rives McDow (2000-06-18) quotes a contact in Iraqi-Kurdistan as follows:
1686 # In the past, some Kurdish nationalists, as a protest to the Iraqi
1687 # Government, did not adhere to daylight saving time.  They referred
1688 # to daylight saving as Saddam time.  But, as of today, the time zone
1689 # in Iraqi-Kurdistan is on standard time with Baghdad, Iraq.
1690 #
1691 # So we&#39;ll ignore the Economist&#39;s claim.

1725 # From Ephraim Silverberg (2001-01-11):
1726 #
1727 # I coined &quot;IST/IDT&quot; circa 1988.  Until then there were three
1728 # different abbreviations in use:
1729 #
1730 # JST  Jerusalem Standard Time [Danny Braniss, Hebrew University]
1731 # IZT  Israel Zonal (sic) Time [Prof. Haim Papo, Technion]
1732 # EEST Eastern Europe Standard Time [used by almost everyone else]
1733 #
1734 # Since timezones should be called by country and not capital cities,
1735 # I ruled out JST.  As Israel is in Asia Minor and not Eastern Europe,
1736 # EEST was equally unacceptable.  Since &quot;zonal&quot; was not compatible with
1737 # any other timezone abbreviation, I felt that &#39;IST&#39; was the way to go
1738 # and, indeed, it has received almost universal acceptance in timezone
1739 # settings in Israeli computers.
1740 #
1741 # In any case, I am happy to share timezone abbreviations with India,
1742 # high on my favorite-country list (and not only because my wife&#39;s
1743 # family is from India).

1812 # (1997-03-04, 1998-03-16, 1998-12-28, 2000-01-17, 2000-07-25, 2004-12-22,
1813 # and 2005-02-17):
1814 
1815 # According to the Office of the Secretary General of the Ministry of
1816 # Interior, there is NO set rule for Daylight-Savings/Standard time changes.
1817 # One thing is entrenched in law, however: that there must be at least 150
1818 # days of daylight savings time annually.  From 1993-1998, the change to
1819 # daylight savings time was on a Friday morning from midnight IST to
1820 # 1 a.m IDT; up until 1998, the change back to standard time was on a
1821 # Saturday night from midnight daylight savings time to 11 p.m. standard
1822 # time.  1996 is an exception to this rule where the change back to standard
1823 # time took place on Sunday night instead of Saturday night to avoid
1824 # conflicts with the Jewish New Year.  In 1999, the change to
1825 # daylight savings time was still on a Friday morning but from
1826 # 2 a.m. IST to 3 a.m. IDT; furthermore, the change back to standard time
1827 # was also on a Friday morning from 2 a.m. IDT to 1 a.m. IST for
1828 # 1999 only.  In the year 2000, the change to daylight savings time was
1829 # similar to 1999, but although the change back will be on a Friday, it
1830 # will take place from 1 a.m. IDT to midnight IST.  Starting in 2001, all
1831 # changes to/from will take place at 1 a.m. old time, but now there is no
1832 # rule as to what day of the week it will take place in as the start date
1833 # (except in 2003) is the night after the Passover Seder (i.e. the eve
1834 # of the 16th of Nisan in the lunar Hebrew calendar) and the end date
1835 # (except in 2002) is three nights before Yom Kippur [Day of Atonement]

1956 # From Paul Eggert (2020-01-19):
1957 # Starting in the 7th century, Japan generally followed an ancient Chinese
1958 # timekeeping system that divided night and day into six hours each,
1959 # with hour length depending on season.  In 1873 the government
1960 # started requiring the use of a Western style 24-hour clock.  See:
1961 # Yulia Frumer, &quot;Making Time: Astronomical Time Measurement in Tokugawa Japan&quot;
1962 # &lt;https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1043907065&gt;.  As the tzdb code and
1963 # data support only 24-hour clocks, its tables model timestamps before
1964 # 1873 using Western-style local mean time.
1965 
1966 # From Hideyuki Suzuki (1998-11-09):
1967 # &#39;Tokyo&#39; usually stands for the former location of Tokyo Astronomical
1968 # Observatory: 139° 44&#39; 40.90&quot; E (9h 18m 58.727s), 35° 39&#39; 16.0&quot; N.
1969 # This data is from &#39;Rika Nenpyou (Chronological Scientific Tables) 1996&#39;
1970 # edited by National Astronomical Observatory of Japan....
1971 # JST (Japan Standard Time) has been used since 1888-01-01 00:00 (JST).
1972 # The law is enacted on 1886-07-07.
1973 
1974 # From Hideyuki Suzuki (1998-11-16):
1975 # The ordinance No. 51 (1886) established &quot;standard time&quot; in Japan,
1976 # which stands for the time on 135° E.
1977 # In the ordinance No. 167 (1895), &quot;standard time&quot; was renamed to &quot;central
1978 # standard time&quot;.  And the same ordinance also established &quot;western standard
1979 # time&quot;, which stands for the time on 120° E....  But &quot;western standard
1980 # time&quot; was abolished in the ordinance No. 529 (1937).  In the ordinance No.
1981 # 167, there is no mention regarding for what place western standard time is
1982 # standard....
1983 #
1984 # I wrote &quot;ordinance&quot; above, but I don&#39;t know how to translate.
1985 # In Japanese it&#39;s &quot;chokurei&quot;, which means ordinance from emperor.
1986 
1987 # From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2013-07-12):
1988 # ...the Meiji Emperor announced Ordinance No. 167 of Meiji Year 28 &quot;The clause

1998 # Today&#39;s _Asahi Evening News_ (page 4) reports that Japan had
1999 # daylight saving between 1948 and 1951, but &quot;the system was discontinued
2000 # because the public believed it would lead to longer working hours.&quot;
2001 
2002 # From Mayumi Negishi in the 2005-08-10 Japan Times:
2003 # http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20050810f2.htm
2004 # Occupation authorities imposed daylight-saving time on Japan on
2005 # [1948-05-01]....  But lack of prior debate and the execution of
2006 # daylight-saving time just three days after the bill was passed generated
2007 # deep hatred of the concept....  The Diet unceremoniously passed a bill to
2008 # dump the unpopular system in October 1951, less than a month after the San
2009 # Francisco Peace Treaty was signed.  (A government poll in 1951 showed 53%
2010 # of the Japanese wanted to scrap daylight-saving time, as opposed to 30% who
2011 # wanted to keep it.)

2160 #
2161 # From Branislav Kojic (in Astana) via Gwillim Law (2005-06-28):
2162 # ... what happened was that the former Kazakhstan Eastern time zone
2163 # was &quot;blended&quot; with the Central zone.  Therefore, Kazakhstan now has
2164 # two time zones, and difference between them is one hour.  The zone
2165 # closer to UTC is the former Western zone (probably still called the
2166 # same), encompassing four provinces in the west: Aqtöbe, Atyraū,
2167 # Mangghystaū, and West Kazakhstan.  The other zone encompasses
2168 # everything else....  I guess that would make Kazakhstan time zones
2169 # de jure UTC+5 and UTC+6 respectively.

2655

2657 # General Information Mongolia
2658 # &lt;http://www.mongoliatourism.gov.mn/general.htm&gt; (1999-09)
2659 # &quot;Time: Mongolia has two time zones. Three westernmost provinces of
2660 # Bayan-Ölgii, Uvs, and Hovd are one hour earlier than the capital city, and
2661 # the rest of the country follows the Ulaanbaatar time, which is UTC/GMT plus
2662 # eight hours.&quot;
2663 
2664 # From Rives McDow (1999-12-13):
2665 # Mongolia discontinued the use of daylight savings time in 1999; 1998
2666 # being the last year it was implemented.  The dates of implementation I am
2667 # unsure of, but most probably it was similar to Russia, except for the time
2668 # of implementation may have been different....
2669 # Some maps in the past have indicated that there was an additional time
2670 # zone in the eastern part of Mongolia, including the provinces of Dornod,
2671 # Sükhbaatar, and possibly Khentii.
2672 
2673 # From Paul Eggert (1999-12-15):
2674 # Naming and spelling is tricky in Mongolia.
2675 # We&#39;ll use Hovd (also spelled Chovd and Khovd) to represent the west zone;
2676 # the capital of the Hovd province is sometimes called Hovd, sometimes Dund-Us,
2677 # and sometimes Jirgalanta (with variant spellings), but the name Hovd
2678 # is good enough for our purposes.
2679 
2680 # From Rives McDow (2001-05-13):
2681 # In addition to Mongolia starting daylight savings as reported earlier
2682 # (adopted DST on 2001-04-27 02:00 local time, ending 2001-09-28),

2689 #
2690 # [The province of Selenge is omitted from the above lists.]
2691

2700 
2701 # From Paul Eggert (2005-07-26):
2702 # We have wildly conflicting information about Mongolia&#39;s time zones.
2703 # Bill Bonnet (2005-05-19) reports that the US Embassy in Ulaanbaatar says
2704 # there is only one time zone and that DST is observed, citing Microsoft
2705 # Windows XP as the source.  Risto Nykänen (2005-05-16) reports that
2706 # travelmongolia.org says there are two time zones (UT +07, +08) with no DST.
2707 # Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-05-20) reports that the Mongolian Embassy in

2739 # (click the English flag for English)
2740 #
2741 # There it appears that flights between Choibalsan and Ulaanbaatar arrive
2742 # about 1:35 - 1:50 hours later in local clock time, no matter the
2743 # direction, while Ulaanbaatar-Khovd takes 2 hours in the Eastern
2744 # direction and 3:35 back, which indicates that Ulaanbaatar and Khovd are
2745 # in different time zones (like we know about), while Choibalsan and
2746 # Ulaanbaatar are in the same time zone (correction needed).
2747 
2748 # From Arthur David Olson (2008-05-19):
2749 # Assume that Choibalsan is indeed offset by 8:00.
2750 # XXX--in the absence of better information, assume that transition
2751 # was at the start of 2008-03-31 (the day of Steffen Thorsen&#39;s report);
2752 # this is almost surely wrong.
2753

2966 # From Amos Shapir (1998-02-15):
2967 #
2968 # From 1917 until 1948-05-15, all of Palestine, including the parts now
2969 # known as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, was under British rule.
2970 # Therefore the rules given for Israel for that period, apply there too...
2971 #
2972 # The Gaza Strip was under Egyptian rule between 1948-05-15 until 1967-06-05
2973 # (except a short occupation by Israel from 1956-11 till 1957-03, but no
2974 # time zone was affected then).  It was never formally annexed to Egypt,
2975 # though.
2976 #
2977 # The rest of Palestine was under Jordanian rule at that time, formally
2978 # annexed in 1950 as the West Bank (and the word &quot;Trans&quot; was dropped from
2979 # the country&#39;s previous name of &quot;the Hashemite Kingdom of the
2980 # Trans-Jordan&quot;).  So the rules for Jordan for that time apply.  Major
2981 # towns in that area are Nablus (Shchem), El-Halil (Hebron), Ramallah, and
2982 # East Jerusalem.
2983 #
2984 # Both areas were occupied by Israel in June 1967, but not annexed (except
2985 # for East Jerusalem).  They were on Israel time since then; there might
2986 # have been a Military Governor&#39;s order about time zones, but I&#39;m not aware
2987 # of any (such orders may have been issued semi-annually whenever summer
2988 # time was in effect, but maybe the legal aspect of time was just neglected).
2989 #
2990 # The Palestinian Authority was established in 1993, and got hold of most
2991 # towns in the West Bank and Gaza by 1995.  I know that in order to
2992 # demonstrate...independence, they have been switching to
2993 # summer time and back on a different schedule than Israel&#39;s, but I don&#39;t
2994 # know when this was started, or what algorithm is used (most likely the
2995 # Jordanian one).
2996 #
2997 # To summarize, the table should probably look something like that:
2998 #
2999 # Area \ when | 1918-1947 | 1948-1967 | 1967-1995 | 1996-
3000 # ------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------
3001 # Israel      | Zion      | Zion      | Zion      | Zion
3002 # West bank   | Zion      | Jordan    | Zion      | Jordan
3003 # Gaza        | Zion      | Egypt     | Zion      | Jordan

3005 # I guess more info may be available from the PA&#39;s web page (if/when they
3006 # have one).

3009 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger write that Gaza did not observe DST until 1957, but go
3010 # with Shapir and assume that it observed DST from 1940 through 1947,
3011 # and that it used Jordanian rules starting in 1996.
3012 # We don&#39;t yet need a separate entry for the West Bank, since
3013 # the only differences between it and Gaza that we know about
3014 # occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
3015 # However, as we get more information, we may need to add entries
3016 # for parts of the West Bank as they transitioned from Israel&#39;s rules
3017 # to Palestine&#39;s rules.

3372 # Saudi Arabia
3373 #
3374 # From Paul Eggert (2018-08-29):
3375 # Time in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian peninsula was not
3376 # standardized until 1968 or so; we don&#39;t know exactly when, and possibly it
3377 # has never been made official.  Richard P Hunt, in &quot;Islam city yielding to
3378 # modern times&quot;, New York Times (1961-04-09), p 20, wrote that only airlines
3379 # observed standard time, and that people in Jeddah mostly observed quasi-solar
3380 # time, doing so by setting their watches at sunrise to 6 o&#39;clock (or to 12
3381 # o&#39;clock for &quot;Arab&quot; time).
3382 #
3383 # Timekeeping differed depending on who you were and which part of Saudi
3384 # Arabia you were in.  In 1969, Elias Antar wrote that although a common
3385 # practice had been to set one&#39;s watch to 12:00 (i.e., midnight) at sunset -
3386 # which meant that the time on one side of a mountain could differ greatly from
3387 # the time on the other side - many foreigners set their watches to 6pm
3388 # instead, while airlines instead used UTC +03 (except in Dhahran, where they
3389 # used UTC +04), Aramco used UTC +03 with DST, and the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line
3390 # Company used Aramco time in eastern Saudi Arabia and airline time in western.
3391 # (The American Military Aid Advisory Group used plain UTC.)  Antar writes,
3392 # &quot;A man named Higgins, so the story goes, used to run a local power
3393 # station. One day, the whole thing became too much for Higgins and he
3394 # assembled his staff and laid down the law. &#39;I&#39;ve had enough of this,&#39; he
3395 # shrieked. &#39;It is now 12 o&#39;clock Higgins Time, and from now on this station is
3396 # going to run on Higgins Time.&#39; And so, until last year, it did.&quot;  See:
3397 # Antar E. Dinner at When? Saudi Aramco World, 1969 March/April. 2-3.
3398 # http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/196902/dinner.at.when.htm
3399 # Also see: Antar EN. Arabian flying is confusing.
3400 # Port Angeles (WA) Evening News. 1965-03-10. page 3.
3401 #
3402 # The TZ database cannot represent quasi-solar time; airline time is the best
3403 # we can do.  The 1946 foreign air news digest of the U.S. Civil Aeronautics
3404 # Board (OCLC 42299995) reported that the &quot;... Arabian Government, inaugurated
3405 # a weekly Dhahran-Cairo service, via the Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and
3406 # Jidda, on March 14, 1947&quot;.  Shanks &amp; Pottenger guessed 1950; go with the
3407 # earlier date.
3408 #
3409 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger also state that until 1968-05-01 Saudi Arabia had two
3410 # time zones; the other zone, at UT +04, was in the far eastern part of
3411 # the country.  Presumably this is documenting airline time.  Ignore this,
3412 # as it&#39;s before our 1970 cutoff.

3722 # From Paul Eggert (2014-10-21) after a heads-up from Trần Ngọc Quân:
3723 # Trần Tiến Bình&#39;s authoritative book &quot;Lịch Việt Nam: thế kỷ XX-XXI (1901-2100)&quot;
3724 # (Nhà xuất bản Văn Hoá - Thông Tin, Hanoi, 2005), pp 49-50,
3725 # is quoted verbatim in:
3726 # http://www.thoigian.com.vn/?mPage=P80D01
3727 # is translated by Brian Inglis in:
3728 # https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2014-October/021654.html
3729 # and is the basis for the information below.
3730 #
3731 # The 1906 transition was effective July 1 and standardized Indochina to
3732 # Phù Liễn Observatory, legally 104° 17&#39; 17&quot; east of Paris.
3733 # It&#39;s unclear whether this meant legal Paris Mean Time (00:09:21) or
3734 # the Paris Meridian (2° 20&#39; 14.03&quot; E); the former yields 07:06:30.1333...
3735 # and the latter 07:06:29.333... so either way it rounds to 07:06:30,
3736 # which is used below even though the modern-day Phù Liễn Observatory
3737 # is closer to 07:06:31.  Abbreviate Phù Liễn Mean Time as PLMT.
3738 #
3739 # The following transitions occurred in Indochina in general (before 1954)
3740 # and in South Vietnam in particular (after 1954):
3741 # To 07:00 on 1911-05-01.
3742 # To 08:00 on 1942-12-31 at 23:00.
3743 # To 09:00 on 1945-03-14 at 23:00.
3744 # To 07:00 on 1945-09-02 in Vietnam.
3745 # To 08:00 on 1947-04-01 in French-controlled Indochina.
3746 # To 07:00 on 1955-07-01 in South Vietnam.
3747 # To 08:00 on 1959-12-31 at 23:00 in South Vietnam.

3775 # The Ho Chi Minh entry suffices for most purposes as it agrees with all of
