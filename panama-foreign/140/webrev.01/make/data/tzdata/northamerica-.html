  44 # From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
  45 # Howse writes (pp 121-125) that time zones were invented by
  46 # Professor Charles Ferdinand Dowd (1825-1904),
  47 # Principal of Temple Grove Ladies&#39; Seminary (Saratoga Springs, NY).
  48 # His pamphlet &quot;A System of National Time for Railroads&quot; (1870)
  49 # was the result of his proposals at the Convention of Railroad Trunk Lines
  50 # in New York City (1869-10).  His 1870 proposal was based on Washington, DC,
  51 # but in 1872-05 he moved the proposed origin to Greenwich.
  52 
  53 # From Paul Eggert (2018-03-20):
  54 # Dowd&#39;s proposal left many details unresolved, such as where to draw
  55 # lines between time zones.  The key individual who made time zones
  56 # work in the US was William Frederick Allen - railway engineer,
  57 # managing editor of the Travelers&#39; Guide, and secretary of the
  58 # General Time Convention, a railway standardization group.  Allen
  59 # spent months in dialogs with scientific and railway leaders,
  60 # developed a workable plan to institute time zones, and presented it
  61 # to the General Time Convention on 1883-04-11, saying that his plan
  62 # meant &quot;local time would be practically abolished&quot; - a plus for
  63 # railway scheduling.  By the next convention on 1883-10-11 nearly all
  64 # railroads had agreed and it took effect on 1883-11-18.  That Sunday
  65 # was called the &quot;day of two noons&quot;, as some locations observed noon
  66 # twice.  Allen witnessed the transition in New York City, writing:
  67 #
  68 #   I heard the bells of St. Paul&#39;s strike on the old time.  Four
  69 #   minutes later, obedient to the electrical signal from the Naval
  70 #   Observatory ... the time-ball made its rapid descent, the chimes
  71 #   of old Trinity rang twelve measured strokes, and local time was
  72 #   abandoned, probably forever.
  73 #
  74 # Most of the US soon followed suit.  See:
  75 # Bartky IR. The adoption of standard time. Technol Cult 1989 Jan;30(1):25-56.
  76 # https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3105430
  77 
  78 # From Paul Eggert (2005-04-16):
  79 # That 1883 transition occurred at 12:00 new time, not at 12:00 old time.
  80 # See p 46 of David Prerau, Seize the daylight, Thunder&#39;s Mouth Press (2005).
  81 
  82 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
  83 # A good source for time zone historical data in the US is
  84 # Thomas G. Shanks, The American Atlas (5th edition),
  85 # San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
  86 # Make sure you have the errata sheet; the book is somewhat useless without it.
  87 # It is the source for most of the pre-1991 US entries below.
  88 
  89 # From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
  90 # Daylight Saving Time was first suggested as a joke by Benjamin Franklin
  91 # in his whimsical essay &quot;An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost
  92 # of Light&quot; published in the Journal de Paris (1784-04-26).
  93 # Not everyone is happy with the results:
  94 #
  95 #	I don&#39;t really care how time is reckoned so long as there is some
  96 #	agreement about it, but I object to being told that I am saving
  97 #	daylight when my reason tells me that I am doing nothing of the kind.
  98 #	I even object to the implication that I am wasting something
  99 #	valuable if I stay in bed after the sun has risen.  As an admirer
 100 #	of moonlight I resent the bossy insistence of those who want to
 101 #	reduce my time for enjoying it.  At the back of the Daylight Saving
 102 #	scheme I detect the bony, blue-fingered hand of Puritanism, eager
 103 #	to push people into bed earlier, and get them up earlier, to make
 104 #	them healthy, wealthy and wise in spite of themselves.

 114 # Shanks says that DST was called &quot;War Time&quot; in the US in 1918 and 1919.
 115 # However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which
 116 # was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently
 117 # time was just called &quot;Standard Time&quot; or &quot;Daylight Saving Time&quot;.
 118 
 119 # From Paul Eggert (2019-06-04):
 120 # Here is the legal basis for the US federal rules.
 121 # * Public Law 65-106 (1918-03-19) implemented standard and daylight saving
 122 #   time for the first time across the US, springing forward on March&#39;s last
 123 #   Sunday and falling back on October&#39;s last Sunday.

 145 # All transitions are at 02:00 local time.
 146 
 147 # From Arthur David Olson:
 148 # Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
 149 # Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.
 150 
 151 # From Arthur David Olson (2000-09-25):
 152 # Last night I heard part of a rebroadcast of a 1945 Arch Oboler radio drama.
 153 # In the introduction, Oboler spoke of &quot;Eastern Peace Time.&quot;
 154 # An AltaVista search turned up:
 155 # https://web.archive.org/web/20000926032210/http://rowayton.org/rhs/hstaug45.html
 156 # &quot;When the time is announced over the radio now, it is &#39;Eastern Peace
 157 # Time&#39; instead of the old familiar &#39;Eastern War Time.&#39;  Peace is wonderful.&quot;
 158 # (August 1945) by way of confirmation.
 159 #
 160 # From Paul Eggert (2017-09-23):
 161 # This was the V-J Day issue of the Clamdigger, a Rowayton, CT newsletter.
 162 
 163 # From Joseph Gallant citing
 164 # George H. Douglas, _The Early Days of Radio Broadcasting_ (1987):
 165 # At 7 P.M. (Eastern War Time) [on 1945-08-14], the networks were set
 166 # to switch to London for Attlee&#39;s address, but the American people
 167 # never got to hear his speech live. According to one press account,
 168 # CBS&#39; Bob Trout was first to announce the word of Japan&#39;s surrender,
 169 # but a few seconds later, NBC, ABC and Mutual also flashed the word
 170 # of surrender, all of whom interrupting the bells of Big Ben in
 171 # London which were to precede Mr. Attlee&#39;s speech.
 172 
 173 # From Paul Eggert (2003-02-09): It was Robert St John, not Bob Trout.  From
 174 # Myrna Oliver&#39;s obituary of St John on page B16 of today&#39;s Los Angeles Times:
 175 #
 176 # ... a war-weary U.S. clung to radios, awaiting word of Japan&#39;s surrender.
 177 # Any announcement from Asia would reach St. John&#39;s New York newsroom on a
 178 # wire service teletype machine, which had prescribed signals for major news.
 179 # Associated Press, for example, would ring five bells before spewing out
 180 # typed copy of an important story, and 10 bells for news &quot;of transcendental
 181 # importance.&quot;
 182 #
 183 # On Aug. 14, stalling while talking steadily into the NBC networks&#39; open
 184 # microphone, St. John heard five bells and waited only to hear a sixth bell,
 185 # before announcing confidently: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, World War II is over.
 186 # The Japanese have agreed to our surrender terms.&quot;
 187 #
 188 # He had scored a 20-second scoop on other broadcasters.
 189 
 190 # From Arthur David Olson (2005-08-22):
 191 # Paul has been careful to use the &quot;US&quot; rules only in those locations
 192 # that are part of the United States; this reflects the real scope of

 399 # In 1869 the Chicago Astronomical Society contracted with the city to keep
 400 # time.  Though delayed by the Great Fire, by 1880 a wire ran from the
 401 # Dearborn Observatory (on the University of Chicago campus) to City Hall,
 402 # which then sent signals to police and fire stations.  However, railroads got
 403 # their time signals from the Allegheny Observatory, the Madison Observatory,
 404 # the Ann Arbor Observatory, etc., so their clocks did not agree with each
 405 # other or with the city&#39;s official time.  The confusion took some years to

 432 # From Paul Eggert (2015-04-06):
 433 # In 1950s Nashville a public clock had dueling faces, one for conservatives
 434 # and the other for liberals; the two sides didn&#39;t agree about the time of day.
 435 # I haven&#39;t found a photo of this clock, nor have I tracked down the TIME
 436 # magazine report cited below, but here&#39;s the story as told by the late
 437 # American journalist John Seigenthaler, who was there:
 438 #
 439 # &quot;The two [newspaper] owners held strongly contrasting political and
 440 # ideological views.  Evans was a New South liberal, Stahlman an Old South
 441 # conservative, and their two papers frequently clashed editorially, often on
 442 # the same day....  In the 1950s as the state legislature was grappling with
 443 # the question of whether to approve daylight saving time for the entire state,
 444 # TIME magazine reported:
 445 #
 446 # &quot;&#39;The Nashville Banner and The Nashville Tennessean rarely agree on anything
 447 # but the time of day - and last week they couldn&#39;t agree on that.&#39;
 448 #
 449 # &quot;It was all too true. The clock on the front of the building had two faces -
 450 # The Tennessean side of the building facing west, the other, east.  When it
 451 # was high noon Banner time, it was 11 a.m. Tennessean time.&quot;
 452 #
 453 # Seigenthaler J. For 100 years, Tennessean had it covered.

 566 #   factor in the defeat of the Dewey-Warren Presidential ticket in California.
 567 #     -- Ross, p 25
 568 #
 569 # On December 8 the governor exercised the option, setting the date to January 1
 570 # (LA Times 1948-12-09).  The transition time was 02:00 (LA Times 1949-01-01).
 571 #

 597 # On Friday, 1867-10-18 (Gregorian), at precisely 15:30 local time, the

 612 # were unaware of the US acquisition of Alaska, much less of any calendar or

 614 # Russian time, and it is more accurate to model this than to ignore it.
 615 # The database format requires an exact transition time; use the Russian

 758 # switched from -11:00 to -10:00 on 1968-09-22 at 02:00,

 761 # From David Flater (2004-11-09):
 762 # In e-mail, 2004-11-02, Ray Hudson, historian/liaison to the Unalaska
 763 # Historic Preservation Commission, provided this information, which
 764 # suggests that Unalaska deviated from statutory time from early 1967
 765 # possibly until 1983:
 766 #
 767 #  Minutes of the Unalaska City Council Meeting, January 10, 1967:
 768 #  &quot;Except for St. Paul and Akutan, Unalaska is the only important
 769 #  location not on Alaska Standard Time.  The following resolution was
 770 #  made by William Robinson and seconded by Henry Swanson: Be it
 771 #  resolved that the City of Unalaska hereby goes to Alaska Standard
 772 #  Time as of midnight Friday, January 13, 1967 (1 A.M. Saturday,
 773 #  January 14, Alaska Standard Time.)  This resolution was passed with
 774 #  three votes for and one against.&quot;

 779 # &quot;Hawaiian Time&quot; by Robert C. Schmitt and Doak C. Cox appears on pages 207-225
 780 # of volume 26 of The Hawaiian Journal of History (1992). As of 2010-12-09,
 781 # the article is available at
 782 # https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/239/2/JL26215.pdf
 783 # and indicates that standard time was adopted effective noon, January
 784 # 13, 1896 (page 218), that in &quot;1933, the Legislature decreed daylight
 785 # saving for the period between the last Sunday of each April and the
 786 # last Sunday of each September, but less than a month later repealed the
 787 # act,&quot; (page 220), that year-round daylight saving time was in effect
 788 # from 1942-02-09 to 1945-09-30 (page 221, with no time of day given for
 789 # when clocks changed) and that clocks were changed by 30 minutes
 790 # effective the second Sunday of June, 1947 (page 219, with no time of
 791 # day given for when clocks changed). A footnote for the 1933 changes
 792 # cites Session Laws of Hawaii 1933, &quot;Act. 90 (approved 26 Apr. 1933)
 793 # and Act 163 (approved 21 May 1933).&quot;
 794

 800 # year, the standard time of this Territory shall be advanced one
 801 # hour...This Act shall take effect upon its approval. Approved this 26th
 802 # day of April, A. D. 1933. LAWRENCE M JUDD, Governor of the Territory of

 830 # Between 1944-01-01 and 1944-04-01 the State of Arizona used standard
 831 # time, but by federal law railroads, airlines, bus lines, military
 832 # personnel, and some engaged in interstate commerce continued to
 833 # observe war (i.e., daylight saving) time.  The 1944-03-17 Phoenix
 834 # Gazette says that was the date the law changed, and that 04-01 was
 835 # the date the state&#39;s clocks would change.  In 1945 the State of
 836 # Arizona used standard time all year, again with exceptions only as
 837 # mandated by federal law.  Arizona observed DST in 1967, but Arizona
 838 # Laws 1968, ch. 183 (effective 1968-03-21) repealed DST.

 882 # A brief but entertaining history of time in Indiana describes a 1949 debate
 883 # in the Indiana House where city legislators (who favored &quot;fast time&quot;)
 884 # tussled with farm legislators (who didn&#39;t) over a bill to outlaw DST:
 885 #  &quot;Lacking enough votes, the city faction tries to filibuster until time runs
 886 #   out on the session at midnight, but rural champion Rep. Herbert Copeland,
 887 #   R-Madison, leans over the gallery railing and forces the official clock
 888 #   back to 9 p.m., breaking it in the process.  The clock sticks on 9 as the
 889 #   debate rages on into the night.  The filibuster finally dies out and the
 890 #   bill passes, while outside the chamber, clocks read 3:30 a.m.  In the end,
 891 #   it doesn&#39;t matter which side won.  The law has no enforcement powers and
 892 #   is simply ignored by fast-time communities.&quot;

 897 # From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
 898 # Since 1970, most of Indiana has been like America/Indiana/Indianapolis,
 899 # with the following exceptions:
 900 #
 901 # - Gibson, Jasper, Lake, LaPorte, Newton, Porter, Posey, Spencer,
 902 #   Vanderburgh, and Warrick counties have been like America/Chicago.
 903 #
 904 # - Dearborn and Ohio counties have been like America/New_York.
 905 #
 906 # - Clark, Floyd, and Harrison counties have been like
 907 #   America/Kentucky/Louisville.
 908 #
 909 # - Crawford, Daviess, Dubois, Knox, Martin, Perry, Pike, Pulaski, Starke,
 910 #   and Switzerland counties have their own time zone histories as noted below.
 911 #
 912 # Shanks partitioned Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
 913 # and wrote &quot;Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.&quot;
 914 # Those Hoosiers!  Such a flighty and changeable people!
 915 # Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
 916 #
 917 # Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
 918 # that they would be ambiguous if we left them at the &#39;America&#39; level.
 919 # So we reluctantly put them all in a subdirectory &#39;America/Indiana&#39;.

 922 # https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2006/01/20/06-563/standard-time-zone-boundary-in-the-state-of-indiana
 923 # says &quot;DOT is relocating the time zone boundary in Indiana to move Starke,
 924 # Pulaski, Knox, Daviess, Martin, Pike, Dubois, and Perry Counties from the
 925 # Eastern Time Zone to the Central Time Zone.... The effective date of
 926 # this rule is 2 a.m. EST Sunday, April 2, 2006, which is the
 927 # changeover date from standard time to Daylight Saving Time.&quot;
 928 # Strictly speaking, this meant the affected counties changed their
 929 # clocks twice that night, but this obviously was in error.  The intent
 930 # was that 01:59:59 EST be followed by 02:00:00 CDT.

1119 #
1120 # From Lake Cumberland LIFE
1121 # http://www.lake-cumberland.com/life/archive/news990129time.shtml
1122 # (1999-01-29) via WKYM-101.7:
1123 # Clinton County has joined Wayne County in asking the DoT to change from
1124 # the Central to the Eastern time zone....  The Wayne County government made
1125 # the same request in December.  And while Russell County officials have not
1126 # taken action, the majority of respondents to a poll conducted there in
1127 # August indicated they would like to change to &quot;fast time&quot; also.
1128 # The three Lake Cumberland counties are the farthest east of any U.S.
1129 # location in the Central time zone.
1130 #
1131 # From Rich Wales (2000-08-29):
1132 # After prolonged debate, and despite continuing deep differences of opinion,
1133 # Wayne County (central Kentucky) is switching from Central (-0600) to Eastern
1134 # (-0500) time.  They won&#39;t &quot;fall back&quot; this year.  See Sara Shipley,
1135 # The difference an hour makes, Nando Times (2000-08-29 15:33 -0400).
1136 #
1137 # From Paul Eggert (2001-07-16):
1138 # The final rule was published in the
1139 # Federal Register 65, 160 (2000-08-17), pp 50154-50158.

1152 #	previously split between MST and CST) ... 1990-10

1156 # Wayne County, KY (from CST to EST) ... 2000-10
1157 #
1158 # From Paul Eggert (2001-07-17):
1159 # We don&#39;t know where the line used to be within Kearny County, KS,
1160 # so omit that change for now.
1161 # See America/Indiana/Knox for the Starke County, IN change.
1162 # See America/North_Dakota/Center for the Oliver County, ND change.
1163 # West Wendover, NV officially switched from Pacific to mountain time on
1164 # 1999-10-31.  See the
1165 # Federal Register 64, 203 (1999-10-21), pp 56705-56707.
1166 # https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-10-21/html/99-27240.htm
1167 # However, the Federal Register says that West Wendover already operated

1169 # hence a separate tz entry is not needed.

1171 # Michigan
1172 #
1173 # From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
1174 # Michigan didn&#39;t observe DST from 1968 to 1973.
1175 #
1176 # From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
1177 # Shanks writes that Michigan started using standard time on 1885-09-18,
1178 # but Howse writes (pp 124-125, referring to Popular Astronomy, 1901-01)
1179 # that Detroit kept
1180 #
1181 #	local time until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should
1182 #	be put back twenty-eight minutes to Central Standard Time.  Half the
1183 #	city obeyed, half refused.  After considerable debate, the decision
1184 #	was rescinded and the city reverted to Sun time.  A derisive offer to
1185 #	erect a sundial in front of the city hall was referred to the
1186 #	Committee on Sewers.  Then, in 1905, Central time was adopted
1187 #	by city vote.
1188 #
1189 # This story is too entertaining to be false, so go with Howse over Shanks.
1190 #
1191 # From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
1192 # Garland (1927) writes &quot;Cleveland and Detroit advanced their clocks
1193 # one hour in 1914.&quot;  This change is not in Shanks.  We have no more
1194 # info, so omit this for now.
1195 #
1196 # From Paul Eggert (2019-07-06):
1197 # Due to a complicated set of legal maneuvers, in 1967 Michigan did
1198 # not start daylight saving time when the rest of the US did.
1199 # Instead, it began DST on Jun 14 at 00:01.  This was big news:
1200 # the Detroit Free Press reported it at the top of Page 1 on
1201 # 1967-06-14, in an article &quot;State Adjusting to Switch to Fast Time&quot;
1202 # by Gary Blonston, above an article about Thurgood Marshall&#39;s
1203 # confirmation to the US Supreme Court.  Although Shanks says Detroit
1204 # observed DST until 1967-10-29 00:01, that time of day seems to be
1205 # incorrect, as the Free Press later said DST ended in Michigan at the
1206 # same time as the rest of the US.  Also, although Shanks reports no DST in
1207 # Detroit in 1968, it did observe DST that year; in the November 1968
1208 # election Michigan voters narrowly repealed DST, effective 1969.
1209 #
1210 # Most of Michigan observed DST from 1973 on, but was a bit late in 1975.

1385 # http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&amp;t=spec&amp;ar=260
1386 # she quotes the Friday November 1/1918 edition of the Creston Review.
1387 # The quote includes these two statements:
1388 # &#39;Sunday the CPR went back to the old system of time...&#39;
1389 # &#39;... The daylight saving scheme was dropped all over Canada at the same time,&#39;
1390 # These statements refer to a transition from daylight time to standard time
1391 # that occurred nationally on Sunday October 27/1918.  This transition was
1392 # also documented in the Saturday October 26/1918 edition of the Toronto Star.
1393 
1394 # In light of that evidence, we alter the date from the earlier believed
1395 # Oct 31, to Oct 27, 1918 (and Sunday is a more likely transition day
1396 # than Thursday) in all Canadian rulesets.

1657 # From Paul Eggert (1997-10-17):
1658 # Mark Brader writes that an article in the 1997-10-14 Toronto Star
1659 # says that Atikokan, Ontario currently does not observe DST,
1660 # but will vote on 11-10 whether to use EST/EDT.
1661 # He also writes that the Ontario Time Act (1990, Chapter T.9)
1662 # http://www.gov.on.ca/MBS/english/publications/statregs/conttext.html
1663 # says that Ontario east of 90W uses EST/EDT, and west of 90W uses CST/CDT.
1664 # Officially Atikokan is therefore on CST/CDT, and most likely this report
1665 # concerns a non-official time observed as a matter of local practice.
1666 #
1667 # From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
1668 # Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Atikokan, Pickle Lake, and
1669 # New Osnaburgh observe CST all year, that Big Trout Lake observes
1670 # CST/CDT, and that Upsala and Shebandowan observe EST/EDT, all in
1671 # violation of the official Ontario rules.
1672 #
1673 # From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
1674 # Chris Walton (2006-07-06) mentioned an article by Stephanie MacLellan in the
1675 # 2005-07-21 Chronicle-Journal, which said:
1676 #
1677 #	The clocks in Atikokan stay set on standard time year-round.
1678 #	This means they spend about half the time on central time and
1679 #	the other half on eastern time.
1680 #
1681 #	For the most part, the system works, Mayor Dennis Brown said.
1682 #
1683 #	&quot;The majority of businesses in Atikokan deal more with Eastern
1684 #	Canada, but there are some that deal with Western Canada,&quot; he
1685 #	said.  &quot;I don&#39;t see any changes happening here.&quot;
1686 #
1687 # Walton also writes &quot;Supposedly Pickle Lake and Mishkeegogamang
1688 # [New Osnaburgh] follow the same practice.&quot;
1689 
1690 # From Garry McKinnon (2006-07-14) via Chris Walton:
1691 # I chatted with a member of my board who has an outstanding memory
1692 # and a long history in Atikokan (and in the telecom industry) and he
1693 # can say for certain that Atikokan has been practicing the current
1694 # time keeping since 1952, at least.
1695 
1696 # From Paul Eggert (2006-07-17):
1697 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger say that Atikokan has agreed with Rainy River
1698 # ever since standard time was introduced, but the information from
1699 # McKinnon sounds more authoritative.  For now, assume that Atikokan
1700 # switched to EST immediately after WWII era daylight saving time
1701 # ended.  This matches the old (less-populous) America/Coral_Harbour
1702 # entry since our cutoff date of 1970, so we can move
1703 # America/Coral_Harbour to the &#39;backward&#39; file.

1710 #
1711 # # From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
1712 # # Shanks &amp; Pottenger write that since 1970 most of Ontario has been like
1713 # # Toronto.
1714 # # Thunder Bay skipped DST in 1973.
1715 # # Many smaller locales did not observe peacetime DST until 1974;
1716 # # Nipigon (EST) and Rainy River (CST) are the largest that we know of.
1717 #
1718 # In the (Toronto) Globe and Mail for Saturday, 1955-09-24, in the bottom
1719 # right corner of page 1, it says that Toronto will return to standard
1720 # time at 2 am Sunday morning (which agrees with the database), and that:
1721 #
1722 #     The one-hour setback will go into effect throughout most of Ontario,
1723 #     except in areas like Windsor which remains on standard time all year.
1724 #
1725 # Windsor is, of course, a lot larger than Nipigon.
1726 #
1727 # I only came across this incidentally.  I don&#39;t know if Windsor began
1728 # observing DST when Detroit did, or in 1974, or on some other date.
1729 #
1730 # By the way, the article continues by noting that:
1731 #
1732 #     Some cities in the United States have pushed the deadline back
1733 #     three weeks and will change over from daylight saving in October.

1746 # require yearly revision. From information kindly furnished by
1747 # the provincial governments and by the postmasters in many cities
1748 # and towns, it is found that the following places used daylight sav-

1766 #			Chambly-Canton	Beaulieu
1767 #			Melbourne	La Tuque
1768 #			St. Théophile	Buckingham
1769 # Ontario		Used generally in the cities and towns along

1772 # Manitoba		Not used.
1773 # Saskatchewan		In Regina only.
1774 # Alberta		Not used.
1775 # British Columbia	Not used.
1776 #
1777 #   With some exceptions, the use of daylight saving may be said to be limited
1778 # to those cities and towns lying between Quebec city and Windsor, Ont.

1909 # Saskatchewan
1910 
1911 # From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):
1912 # The first actual adoption of DST in Canada was at the municipal
1913 # level.  As the [Toronto] Star put it (1912-06-07), &quot;While people
1914 # elsewhere have long been talking of legislation to save daylight,
1915 # the city of Moose Jaw [Saskatchewan] has acted on its own hook.&quot;
1916 # DST in Moose Jaw began on Saturday, 1912-06-01 (no time mentioned:
1917 # presumably late evening, as below), and would run until &quot;the end of
1918 # the summer&quot;.  The discrepancy between municipal time and railroad
1919 # time was noted.
1920 
1921 # From Paul Eggert (2003-07-27):
1922 # Willett (1914-03) notes that DST &quot;has been in operation ... in the
1923 # City of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, for one year.&quot;
1924 
1925 # From Paul Eggert (2019-07-25):
1926 # Pearce&#39;s book says Regina observed DST in 1914-1917.  No dates and times,
1927 # unfortunately.  It also says that in 1914 Saskatoon observed DST
1928 # from 1 June to 6 July, and that DST was also tried out in Davidson,
1929 # Melfort, and Prince Albert.
1930 
1931 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
1932 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger say that since 1970 this region has mostly been as Regina.
1933 # Some western towns (e.g. Swift Current) switched from MST/MDT to CST in 1972.
1934 # Other western towns (e.g. Lloydminster) are like Edmonton.
1935 # Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Denare Beach and Creighton
1936 # are like Winnipeg, in violation of Saskatchewan law.
1937 
1938 # From W. Jones (1992-11-06):
1939 # The. . .below is based on information I got from our law library, the
1940 # provincial archives, and the provincial Community Services department.
1941 # A precise history would require digging through newspaper archives, and
1942 # since you didn&#39;t say what you wanted, I didn&#39;t bother.
1943 #
1944 # Saskatchewan is split by a time zone meridian (105W) and over the years
1945 # the boundary became pretty ragged as communities near it reevaluated
1946 # their affiliations in one direction or the other.  In 1965 a provincial
1947 # referendum favoured legislating common time practices.
1948 #
1949 # On 15 April 1966 the Time Act (c. T-14, Revised Statutes of
1950 # Saskatchewan 1978) was proclaimed, and established that the eastern
1951 # part of Saskatchewan would use CST year round, that districts in
1952 # northwest Saskatchewan would by default follow CST but could opt to
1953 # follow Mountain Time rules (thus 1 hour difference in the winter and
1954 # zero in the summer), and that districts in southwest Saskatchewan would
1955 # by default follow MT but could opt to follow CST.
1956 #
1957 # It took a few years for the dust to settle (I know one story of a town
1958 # on one time zone having its school in another, such that a mom had to
1959 # serve her family lunch in two shifts), but presently it seems that only
1960 # a few towns on the border with Alberta (e.g. Lloydminster) follow MT
1961 # rules any more; all other districts appear to have used CST year round
1962 # since sometime in the 1960s.
1963 
1964 # From Chris Walton (2006-06-26):
1965 # The Saskatchewan time act which was last updated in 1996 is about 30 pages
1966 # long and rather painful to read.

2042 # Shanks &amp; Pottenger write that since 1970 most of this region has
2043 # been like Vancouver.
2044 # Dawson Creek uses MST.  Much of east BC is like Edmonton.
2045 # Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Creston is like Dawson Creek.
2046 
2047 # It seems though that (re: Creston) is not entirely correct:
2048 
2049 # From Chris Walton (2011-12-01):
2050 # There are two areas within the Canadian province of British Columbia
2051 # that do not currently observe daylight saving:
2052 # a) The Creston Valley (includes the town of Creston and surrounding area)
2053 # b) The eastern half of the Peace River Regional District
2054 # (includes the cities of Dawson Creek and Fort St. John)
2055 
2056 # Earlier this year I stumbled across a detailed article about the time
2057 # keeping history of Creston; it was written by Tammy Hardwick who is the
2058 # manager of the Creston &amp; District Museum. The article was written in May 2009.
2059 # http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&amp;t=spec&amp;ar=260
2060 # According to the article, Creston has not changed its clocks since June 1918.
2061 # i.e. Creston has been stuck on UT-7 for 93 years.
2062 # Dawson Creek, on the other hand, changed its clocks as recently as April 1972.
2063 
2064 # Unfortunately the exact date for the time change in June 1918 remains
2065 # unknown and will be difficult to ascertain.  I e-mailed Tammy a few months
2066 # ago to ask if Sunday June 2 was a reasonable guess.  She said it was just
2067 # as plausible as any other date (in June).  She also said that after writing
2068 # the article she had discovered another time change in 1916; this is the
2069 # subject of another article which she wrote in October 2010.
2070 # http://www.creston.museum.bc.ca/index.php?module=comments&amp;uop=view_comment&amp;cm+id=56
2071 
2072 # Here is a summary of the three clock change events in Creston&#39;s history:
2073 # 1. 1884 or 1885: adoption of Mountain Standard Time (GMT-7)
2074 # Exact date unknown
2075 # 2. Oct 1916: switch to Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8)
2076 # Exact date in October unknown; Sunday October 1 is a reasonable guess.
2077 # 3. June 1918: switch to Pacific Daylight Time (GMT-7)
2078 # Exact date in June unknown; Sunday June 2 is a reasonable guess.
2079 # note 1:
2080 # On Oct 27/1918 when daylight saving ended in the rest of Canada,
2081 # Creston did not change its clocks.
2082 # note 2:
2083 # During WWII when the Federal Government legislated a mandatory clock change,
2084 # Creston did not oblige.
2085 # note 3:
2086 # There is no guarantee that Creston will remain on Mountain Standard Time
2087 # (UTC-7) forever.
2088 # The subject was debated at least once this year by the town Council.
2089 # http://www.bclocalnews.com/kootenay_rockies/crestonvalleyadvance/news/116760809.html
2090 
2091 # During a period WWII, summer time (Daylight saying) was mandatory in Canada.
2092 # In Creston, that was handled by shifting the area to PST (-8:00) then applying
2093 # summer time to cause the offset to be -7:00, the same as it had been before
2094 # the change.  It can be argued that the timezone abbreviation during this
2095 # period should be PDT rather than MST, but that doesn&#39;t seem important enough
2096 # (to anyone) to further complicate the rules.
2097 
2098 # The transition dates (and times) are guesses.
2099 
2100 # From Matt Johnson (2015-09-21):
2101 # Fort Nelson, BC, Canada will cancel DST this year.  So while previously they
2102 # were aligned with America/Vancouver, they&#39;re now aligned with
2103 # America/Dawson_Creek.

2107 # This requires a new zone for the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality,
2108 # America/Fort_Nelson.  The resolution of 2014-12-08 was reached following a
2109 # 2014-11-15 poll with nearly 75% support.  Effectively, the municipality has
2110 # been on MST (-0700) like Dawson Creek since it advanced its clocks on
2111 # 2015-03-08.
2112 #
2113 # From Paul Eggert (2019-07-25):
2114 # Shanks says Fort Nelson did not observe DST in 1946, unlike Vancouver.
2115 # Alois Triendl confirmed this on 07-22, citing the 1946-04-27 Vancouver Daily
2116 # Province.  He also cited the 1946-09-28 Victoria Daily Times, which said
2117 # that Vancouver, Victoria, etc. &quot;change at midnight Saturday&quot;; for now,
2118 # guess they meant 02:00 Sunday since 02:00 was common practice in Vancouver.
2119 #
2120 # Early Vancouver, Volume Four, by Major J.S. Matthews, V.D., 2011 edition

2333 # Nunavut now has two time zones (2000-11-10):
2334 # The Nunavut government would allow its employees in Kugluktuk and
2335 # Cambridge Bay to operate on central time year-round, putting them
2336 # one hour behind the rest of Nunavut for six months during the winter.
2337 # At the end of October the two communities had rebelled against
2338 # Nunavut&#39;s unified time zone, refusing to shift to eastern time with
2339 # the rest of the territory for the winter.  Cambridge Bay remained on
2340 # central time, while Kugluktuk, even farther west, reverted to
2341 # mountain time, which they had used before the advent of Nunavut&#39;s
2342 # unified time zone in 1999.
2343 #

2350 # From Rives McDow (2001-03-07):
2351 # The premier of Nunavut has issued a ministerial statement advising
2352 # that effective 2001-04-01, the territory of Nunavut will revert
2353 # back to three time zones (mountain, central, and eastern).  Of the

2360 # From Gwillim Law (2005-05-21):
2361 # According to ...
2362 # http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/geomap.asp
2363 # (from a 1998 Canadian Geographic article), the de facto and de jure time
2364 # for Southampton Island (at the north end of Hudson Bay) is UTC-5 all year
2365 # round.  Using Google, it&#39;s easy to find other websites that confirm this.
2366 # I wasn&#39;t able to find how far back this time regimen goes, but since it
2367 # predates the creation of Nunavut, it probably goes back many years....
2368 # The Inuktitut name of Coral Harbour is Sallit, but it&#39;s rarely used.
2369 #
2370 # From Paul Eggert (2014-10-17):
2371 # For lack of better information, assume that Southampton Island observed
2372 # daylight saving only during wartime.  Gwillim Law&#39;s email also
2373 # mentioned maps now maintained by National Research Council Canada;
2374 # see above for an up-to-date link.

2376 # From Chris Walton (2007-03-01):
2377 # ... the community of Resolute (located on Cornwallis Island in
2378 # Nunavut) moved from Central Time to Eastern Time last November.
2379 # Basically the community did not change its clocks at the end of
2380 # daylight saving....
2381 # http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2006-11/nov13_06none.html
2382 
2383 # From Chris Walton (2011-03-21):
2384 # Back in 2007 I initiated the creation of a new &quot;zone file&quot; for Resolute
2385 # Bay. Resolute Bay is a small community located about 900km north of
2386 # the Arctic Circle. The zone file was required because Resolute Bay had
2387 # decided to use UTC-5 instead of UTC-6 for the winter of 2006-2007.
2388 #
2389 # According to new information which I received last week, Resolute Bay
2390 # went back to using UTC-6 in the winter of 2007-2008...
2391 #
2392 # On March 11/2007 most of Canada went onto daylight saving. On March
2393 # 14/2007 I phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office to do a &quot;time check.&quot; I
2394 # talked to somebody that was both knowledgeable and helpful. I was able
2395 # to confirm that Resolute Bay was still operating on UTC-5. It was
2396 # explained to me that Resolute Bay had been on the Eastern Time zone
2397 # (EST) in the winter, and was now back on the Central Time zone (CDT).
2398 # i.e. the time zone had changed twice in the last year but the clocks
2399 # had not moved. The residents had to know which time zone they were in
2400 # so they could follow the correct TV schedule...
2401 #
2402 # On Nov 02/2008 most of Canada went onto standard time. On Nov 03/2008 I
2403 # phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office...[D]ue to the challenging nature
2404 # of the phone call, I decided to seek out an alternate source of
2405 # information. I found an e-mail address for somebody by the name of
2406 # Stephanie Adams whose job was listed as &quot;Inns North Support Officer for
2407 # Arctic Co-operatives.&quot; I was under the impression that Stephanie lived
2408 # and worked in Resolute Bay...
2409 #
2410 # On March 14/2011 I phoned the hamlet office again. I was told that
2411 # Resolute Bay had been using Central Standard Time over the winter of
2412 # 2010-2011 and that the clocks had therefore been moved one hour ahead
2413 # on March 13/2011. The person I talked to was aware that Resolute Bay
2414 # had previously experimented with Eastern Standard Time but he could not
2415 # tell me when the practice had stopped.
2416 #
2417 # On March 17/2011 I searched the Web to find an e-mail address of
2418 # somebody that might be able to tell me exactly when Resolute Bay went
2419 # off Eastern Standard Time. I stumbled on the name &quot;Aziz Kheraj.&quot; Aziz
2420 # used to be the mayor of Resolute Bay and he apparently owns half the
2421 # businesses including &quot;South Camp Inn.&quot; This website has some info on
2422 # Aziz:
2423 # http://www.uphere.ca/node/493
2424 #
2425 # I sent Aziz an e-mail asking when Resolute Bay had stopped using
2426 # Eastern Standard Time.
2427 #
2428 # Aziz responded quickly with this: &quot;hi, The time was not changed for the
2429 # 1 year only, the following year, the community went back to the old way
2430 # of &quot;spring ahead-fall behind&quot; currently we are zulu plus 5 hrs and in
2431 # the winter Zulu plus 6 hrs&quot;
2432 #
2433 # This of course conflicted with everything I had ascertained in November 2008.
2434 #
2435 # I sent Aziz a copy of my 2008 e-mail exchange with Stephanie. Aziz
2436 # responded with this: &quot;Hi, Stephanie lives in Winnipeg. I live here, You
2437 # may want to check with the weather office in Resolute Bay or do a
2438 # search on the weather through Env. Canada. web site&quot;
2439 #
2440 # If I had realized the Stephanie did not live in Resolute Bay I would
2441 # never have contacted her.  I now believe that all the information I
2442 # obtained in November 2008 should be ignored...
2443 # I apologize for reporting incorrect information in 2008.

2540 #    - Baja California Sur, Nayarit, Sinaloa and Sonora (the Mexico/BajaSur TZ)
2541 #    - The rest of the country (the Mexico/General TZ)
2542 #
2543 # 2. From the first Sunday in April at 2:00 AM to the last Sunday in October
2544 #    at 2:00 AM, the times in each zone are as follows:

2546 #    BajaSur:   GMT+6
2547 #    General:   GMT+5
2548 #

2551 #    BajaSur:   GMT+7
2552 #    General:   GMT+6

2885 # From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
2886 # Formerly there was an America/Ensenada zone, which differed from
2887 # America/Tijuana only in that it did not observe DST from 1976
2888 # through 1995.  This was as per Shanks (1999).  But Shanks &amp; Pottenger say
2889 # Ensenada did not observe DST from 1948 through 1975.  Guy Harris reports
2890 # that the 1987 OAG says &quot;Only Ensenada, Mexicali, San Felipe and
2891 # Tijuana observe DST,&quot; which agrees with Shanks &amp; Pottenger but implies that
2892 # DST-observance was a town-by-town matter back then.  This concerns
2893 # data after 1970 so most likely there should be at least one Zone

3005 # For now, stick with Shanks &amp; Pottenger.

3007 # From Arthur David Olson (1999-03-29):
3008 # The 1999-03-28 exhibition baseball game held in Havana, Cuba, between
3009 # the Cuban National Team and the Baltimore Orioles was carried live on
3010 # the Orioles Radio Network, including affiliate WTOP in Washington, DC.
3011 # During the game, play-by-play announcer Jim Hunter noted that
3012 # &quot;We&#39;ll be losing two hours of sleep...Cuba switched to Daylight Saving
3013 # Time today.&quot;  (The &quot;two hour&quot; remark referred to losing one hour of
3014 # sleep on 1999-03-28 - when the announcers were in Cuba as it switched
3015 # to DST - and one more hour on 1999-04-04 - when the announcers will have

3088 # which is not present in tzdata/Shanks. So there is a chance we need to

3290 # on the Web page of the Haitian Consulate in Chicago (2005-03-31),
3291 # &lt;http://www.haitianconsulate.org/time.doc&gt;.  Translated from French, it says:
3292 #
3293 #  &quot;The Prime Minister&#39;s Communication Office notifies the public in general
3294 #   and the press in particular that, following a decision of the Interior
3295 #   Ministry and the Territorial Collectivities [I suppose that means the
3296 #   provinces], Haiti will move to Eastern Daylight Time in the night from next
3297 #   Saturday the 2nd to Sunday the 3rd.
3298 #
3299 #  &quot;Consequently, the Prime Minister&#39;s Communication Office wishes to inform
3300 #   the population that the country&#39;s clocks will be set forward one hour
3301 #   starting at midnight.  This provision will hold until the last Saturday in

3308 # last year, so the current &quot;only&quot; rule for 2005 might be changed to a
3309 # &quot;max&quot; rule or to last until 2006. (Who knows if they will observe DST
3310 # next year or if they will extend their DST like US/Canada next year).
