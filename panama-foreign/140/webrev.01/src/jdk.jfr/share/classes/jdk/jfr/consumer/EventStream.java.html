 43 /**
 44  * Represents a stream of events.
 45  * &lt;p&gt;
 46  * A stream is a sequence of events and the way to interact with a stream is to
 47  * register actions. The {@code EventStream} interface is not to be implemented
 48  * and future versions of the JDK may prevent this completely.
 49  * &lt;p&gt;
 50  * To receive a notification when an event arrives, register an action using the
 51  * {@link #onEvent(Consumer)} method. To filter the stream for an event with a
 52  * specific name, use {@link #onEvent(String, Consumer)} method.
 53  * &lt;p&gt;
 54  * By default, the same {@code RecordedEvent} object can be used to
 55  * represent two or more distinct events. That object can be delivered
 56  * multiple times to the same action as well as to other actions. To use an
 57  * event object after the action is completed, the
 58  * {@link #setReuse(boolean)} method should be set to {@code false} so a
 59  * new object is allocated for each event.
 60  * &lt;p&gt;
 61  * Events are delivered in batches. To receive a notification when a batch is
 62  * complete, register an action using the {@link #onFlush(Runnable)} method.
 63  * This is an opportunity to aggregate or push data to external systems while
 64  * the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is preparing the next batch.
 65  * &lt;p&gt;
 66  * Events within a batch are sorted chronologically by their end time.
 67  * Well-ordering of events is only maintained for events available to the JVM at
 68  * the point of flush, i.e. for the set of events delivered as a unit in a
 69  * single batch. Events delivered in a batch could therefore be out-of-order
 70  * compared to events delivered in a previous batch, but never out-of-order with
 71  * events within the same batch. If ordering is not a concern, sorting can be
 72  * disabled using the {@link #setOrdered(boolean)} method.
 73  * &lt;p&gt;
 74  * To dispatch events to registered actions, the stream must be started. To
 75  * start processing in the current thread, invoke the {@link #start()} method.
 76  * To process actions asynchronously in a separate thread, invoke the
 77  * {@link #startAsync()} method. To await completion of the stream, use the
 78  * awaitTermination {@link #awaitTermination()} or the
 79  * {@link #awaitTermination(Duration)} method.
 80  * &lt;p&gt;
 81  * When a stream ends it is automatically closed. To manually stop processing of
 82  * events, close the stream by invoking the {@link #close()} method. A stream
 83  * can also be automatically closed in exceptional circumstances, for example if
 84  * the JVM that is being monitored exits. To receive a notification in any of
 85  * these occasions, use the {@link #onClose(Runnable)} method to register an
 86  * action.
 87  * &lt;p&gt;
 88  * If an unexpected exception occurs in an action, it is possible to catch the
 89  * exception in an error handler. An error handler can be registered using the
 90  * {@link #onError(Consumer)} method. If no error handler is registered, the
 91  * default behavior is to print the exception and its backtrace to the standard
 92  * error stream.
 93  * &lt;p&gt;
 94  * The following example shows how an {@code EventStream} can be used to listen
 95  * to events on a JVM running Flight Recorder
 96  *
 97  * &lt;pre&gt;{@literal
 98  * try (var es = EventStream.openRepository()) {
 99  *   es.onEvent(&quot;jdk.CPULoad&quot;, event -&gt; {
100  *     System.out.println(&quot;CPU Load &quot; + event.getEndTime());
101  *     System.out.println(&quot; Machine total: &quot; + 100 * event.getFloat(&quot;machineTotal&quot;) + &quot;%&quot;);
102  *     System.out.println(&quot; JVM User: &quot; + 100 * event.getFloat(&quot;jvmUser&quot;) + &quot;%&quot;);
103  *     System.out.println(&quot; JVM System: &quot; + 100 * event.getFloat(&quot;jvmSystem&quot;) + &quot;%&quot;);
104  *     System.out.println();
105  *   });
106  *   es.onEvent(&quot;jdk.GarbageCollection&quot;, event -&gt; {
107  *     System.out.println(&quot;Garbage collection: &quot; + event.getLong(&quot;gcId&quot;));
108  *     System.out.println(&quot; Cause: &quot; + event.getString(&quot;cause&quot;));
109  *     System.out.println(&quot; Total pause: &quot; + event.getDuration(&quot;sumOfPauses&quot;));
110  *     System.out.println(&quot; Longest pause: &quot; + event.getDuration(&quot;longestPause&quot;));
111  *     System.out.println();
112  *   });
113  *   es.start();
114  * }
115  * }&lt;/pre&gt;
116  * &lt;p&gt;
117  * To start recording together with the stream, see {@link RecordingStream}.
