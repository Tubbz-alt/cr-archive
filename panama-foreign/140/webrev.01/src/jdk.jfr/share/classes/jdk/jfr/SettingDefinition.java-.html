33  * Annotation that specifies that a method in an event class should be used to
34  * filter out events.
35  * &lt;p&gt;
36  * For the method to be valid it must return a {@code SettingControl} and only have one
37  * parameter, which should be a non-abstract subclass of {@link SettingControl}
38  * &lt;p&gt;
39  * The return value of the method specifies whether the event is to be
40  * written to the Flight Recorder system or not.
41  * &lt;p&gt;
42  * The following example shows how to annotate a method in an event class.
43  *
44  * &lt;pre&gt;
45  * &lt;code&gt;
46  * class HelloWorld extend Event {
47  *
48  *   {@literal @}Label(&quot;Message&quot;);
49  *   String message;
50  *
51  *   {@literal @}SettingDefinition;
52  *   {@literal @}Label(&quot;Message Filter&quot;);
53  *   public boolean filter(RegExpControl regExp) {
54  *     return regExp.matches(message);
55  *   }
56  * }
57  * &lt;/code&gt;
58  * &lt;/pre&gt;
59  *
60  * For an example of how the setting controls are defined, see
61  * {@link SettingControl}.
62  *
63  * @see SettingControl
