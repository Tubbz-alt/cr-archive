<span class="line-modified"> 45  *       &amp;#064;Label(&quot;Message&quot;)</span>
 46  *       String message;
 47  *   }
 48  *
 49  *   public static void main(String... args) {
 50  *       HelloWorld event = new HelloWorld();
 51  *       event.message = &quot;hello, world!&quot;;
 52  *       event.commit();
 53  *   }
 54  * }
<span class="line-modified"> 55  * &lt;/code&gt;</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 56  * &lt;/pre&gt;</span>
 57  * &lt;p&gt;
 58  * After an event is allocated and its field members are populated, it can be
<span class="line-modified"> 59  * written to the Flight Recorder system by using the {@code #commit()} method.</span>
 60  * &lt;p&gt;
 61  * By default, an event is enabled. To disable an event annotate the
 62  * {@link Event} class with {@code @Enabled(false)}.
 63  * &lt;p&gt;
 64  * Supported field types are the Java primitives: {@code boolean}, {@code char},
 65  * {@code byte}, {@code short}, {@code int}, {@code long}, {@code float}, and
 66  * {@code double}. Supported reference types are: {@code String}, {@code Thread}
 67  * and {@code Class}. Arrays, enums, and other reference types are silently
 68  * ignored and not included. Fields that are of the supported types can be
 69  * excluded by using the transient modifier. Static fields, even of the
 70  * supported types, are not included.
 71  * &lt;p&gt;
 72  * Tools can visualize data in a meaningful way when annotations are used (for
 73  * example, {@code Label}, {@code Description}, and {@code Timespan}).
 74  * Annotations applied to an {@link Event} class or its fields are included if
 75  * they are present (indirectly, directly, or associated), have the
 76  * {@code MetadataDefinition} annotation, and they do not contain enums, arrays,
 77  * or classes.
 78  * &lt;p&gt;
 79  * Gathering data to store in an event can be expensive. The
 80  * {@link Event#shouldCommit()} method can be used to verify whether an event
 81  * instance would actually be written to the system when the
<span class="line-modified"> 82  * {@code Event#commit()commit} method is invoked. If</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 83  * {@link Event#shouldCommit()} returns false, then those operations can be</span>
 84  * avoided.
