 29  * Base class for events, to be subclassed in order to define events and their
 30  * fields.
 31  * &lt;p&gt;
 32  * The following example shows how to implement an {@code Event} class.
 33  *
 34  * &lt;pre&gt;
 35  * &lt;code&gt;
 36  * import jdk.jfr.Event;
 37  * import jdk.jfr.Description;
 38  * import jdk.jfr.Label;
 39  *
 40  * public class Example {
 41  *
 42  *   &amp;#064;Label(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
 43  *   &amp;#064;Description(&quot;Helps programmer getting started&quot;)
 44  *   static class HelloWorld extends Event {
 45  *       &amp;#064;Label(&quot;Message&quot;)
 46  *       String message;
 47  *   }
 48  *
 49  *   public static void main(String... args) {
 50  *       HelloWorld event = new HelloWorld();
 51  *       event.message = &quot;hello, world!&quot;;
 52  *       event.commit();
 53  *   }
 54  * }
 55  * &lt;/code&gt;
 56  * &lt;/pre&gt;
 57  * &lt;p&gt;
 58  * After an event is allocated and its field members are populated, it can be
 59  * written to the Flight Recorder system by using the {@code #commit()} method.
 60  * &lt;p&gt;
 61  * By default, an event is enabled. To disable an event annotate the
 62  * {@link Event} class with {@code @Enabled(false)}.
 63  * &lt;p&gt;
 64  * Supported field types are the Java primitives: {@code boolean}, {@code char},
 65  * {@code byte}, {@code short}, {@code int}, {@code long}, {@code float}, and
 66  * {@code double}. Supported reference types are: {@code String}, {@code Thread}
 67  * and {@code Class}. Arrays, enums, and other reference types are silently
 68  * ignored and not included. Fields that are of the supported types can be
 69  * excluded by using the transient modifier. Static fields, even of the
 70  * supported types, are not included.
 71  * &lt;p&gt;
 72  * Tools can visualize data in a meaningful way when annotations are used (for
 73  * example, {@code Label}, {@code Description}, and {@code Timespan}).
 74  * Annotations applied to an {@link Event} class or its fields are included if
 75  * they are present (indirectly, directly, or associated), have the
 76  * {@code MetadataDefinition} annotation, and they do not contain enums, arrays,
 77  * or classes.
 78  * &lt;p&gt;
 79  * Gathering data to store in an event can be expensive. The
 80  * {@link Event#shouldCommit()} method can be used to verify whether an event
 81  * instance would actually be written to the system when the
 82  * {@code Event#commit()commit} method is invoked. If
 83  * {@link Event#shouldCommit()} returns false, then those operations can be
 84  * avoided.
 85  *
