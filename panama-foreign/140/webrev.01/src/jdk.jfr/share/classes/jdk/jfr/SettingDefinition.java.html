33  * Annotation that specifies that a method in an event class should be used to
34  * filter out events.
35  * &lt;p&gt;
36  * For the method to be valid it must return a {@code SettingControl} and only have one
37  * parameter, which should be a non-abstract subclass of {@link SettingControl}
38  * &lt;p&gt;
39  * The return value of the method specifies whether the event is to be
40  * written to the Flight Recorder system or not.
41  * &lt;p&gt;
42  * The following example shows how to annotate a method in an event class.
43  *
44  * &lt;pre&gt;{@literal
45  * class HelloWorld extends Event {
46  *
47  *   @Label(&quot;Message&quot;)
48  *   String message;
49  *
50  *   @SettingDefinition
51  *   @Label(&quot;Message Filter&quot;)
52  *   public boolean filter(RegExpControl regExp) {
53  *     return regExp.matches(message);
54  *   }
55  * }
56  * }&lt;/pre&gt;
57  *
58  * For an example of how the setting controls are defined, see
59  * {@link SettingControl}.
