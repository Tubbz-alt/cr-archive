1795 .B \f[CB]path\-to\-gc\-roots=\f[R]{\f[CB]true\f[R]|\f[CB]false\f[R]}

1801 The path to GC roots is useful for finding memory leaks, but collecting
1802 it is time\-consuming.
1803 Enable this option only when you start a recording for an application
1804 that you suspect has a memory leak.
1805 If the \f[CB]settings\f[R] parameter is set to \f[CB]profile\f[R], the stack
1806 trace from where the potential leaking object was allocated is included
1807 in the information collected.

1814 This default settings file collects a predefined set of information with
1815 low overhead, so it has minimal impact on performance and can be used

1819 A second settings file is also provided, profile.jfc, which provides
1820 more data than the default configuration, but can have more overhead and
1821 impact performance.
1822 Use this configuration for short periods of time when more information
1823 is needed.
