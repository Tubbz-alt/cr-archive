  .B \f[CB]settings=\f[R]\f[I]path\f[R]
  Specifies the path and name of the event settings file (of type JFC).
  By default, the \f[CB]default.jfc\f[R] file is used, which is located in
<span class="line-modified">! \f[CB]JRE_HOME/lib/jfr\f[R].</span>
  This default settings file collects a predefined set of information with
  low overhead, so it has minimal impact on performance and can be used
