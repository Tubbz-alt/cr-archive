 .B \f[CB]settings=\f[R]\f[I]path\f[R]
 Specifies the path and name of the event settings file (of type JFC).
 By default, the \f[CB]default.jfc\f[R] file is used, which is located in
-\f[CB]JRE_HOME/lib/jfr\f[R].
+\f[CB]JAVA_HOME/lib/jfr\f[R].
 This default settings file collects a predefined set of information with
 low overhead, so it has minimal impact on performance and can be used
 with recordings that run continuously.
