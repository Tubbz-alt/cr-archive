114 
115 Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
116 non-exclusive license:
117 
118 (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
119     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

127 
128 2.2. Effective Date
129 
130 The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
131 become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
132 distributes such Contribution.
133 
134 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
135 
136 The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
137 this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
138 distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
139 Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
140 Contributor:
141 
142 (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
143     or
144 
145 (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party&#39;s
146     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
147     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
148     Version); or
149 
150 (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
151     its Contributions.
152 
153 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
154 or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
155 the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
156 
157 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
158 
159 No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
160 distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
161 License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
162 permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
163 
164 2.5. Representation
165 
166 Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
167 Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
168 to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
169 
170 2.6. Fair Use
171 
172 This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
173 applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
174 equivalents.
175 
176 2.7. Conditions
177 
178 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
179 in Section 2.1.
180 
181 3. Responsibilities
182 -------------------
183 
184 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
185 
186 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
187 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
188 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
189 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
190 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
191 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code
192 Form.
193 
194 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
195 
196 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
197 
198 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
199     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
200     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
201     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
202     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
203 
204 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
205     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
206     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
207     the recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
208 
209 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
210 
211 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
212 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
213 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
214 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
215 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
216 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
217 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
218 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
219 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
220 License(s).
221 
222 3.4. Notices
223 
224 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
225 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
226 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
227 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
228 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
229 
230 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
231 
232 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
233 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
234 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
235 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
236 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
237 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
238 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
239 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
240 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
241 jurisdiction.
242 
243 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
244 ---------------------------------------------------
245 
246 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
247 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
248 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
249 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
250 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
251 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
252 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
253 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
254 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
255 
256 5. Termination
257 --------------
258 
259 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
260 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
261 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
262 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
263 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
264 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
265 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
266 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
267 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
268 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
269 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
270 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
271 Your receipt of the notice.
272 
273 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
274 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
275 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
276 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
277 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
278 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
279 
280 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
281 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
282 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
283 prior to termination shall survive termination.

297 *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
298 *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *

328 -------------
329 
330 Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the

340 This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
341 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
342 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
343 necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
344 that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
345 shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
