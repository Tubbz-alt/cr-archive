 32  * DESCRIPTION
 33  *     Creates a sequence of method handles that manipulates arguments. The following manipulations are used:
 34  *     - Numeric conversions
 35  *     - Boxing and unboxing
 36  *     - Adding arguments, binding arguments
 37  *     - Deleting arguments
 38  *     - Reordering arguments
 39  *     - Array scattering and gathering
 40  *     - A MH that calls pair of methods (&quot;guardWithTest&quot;)
 41  *     - The test calculates the &quot;correct result&quot; of calling the sequence of method handles by using it&#39;s own logic and compares it with the result of calling MHs.
