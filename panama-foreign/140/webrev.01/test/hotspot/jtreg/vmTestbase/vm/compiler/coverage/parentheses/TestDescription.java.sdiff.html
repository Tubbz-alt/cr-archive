32  * DESCRIPTION
33  *     This test works as follows:
34  *     1. Generates random proper list of following JVM instructions:
35  *     -Integer constants: ICONST_M1, ICONST_0, ICONST_1, ICONST_2, ICONST_3, ICONST_4, ICONST_5
36  *     -Integer arithmetics: IADD, ISUB, IMUL, IAND, IOR, IXOR, ISHL, ISHR, INEG
37  *     -Stack operations: DUP, SWAP
38  *     -NOP
39  *     (If loadFrom command line option is setted, test will be use instruction sequence from file.
40  *     It is useful for reproducing failures.)
41  *     2. Executes this sequence in to ways: with TinyInstructionsExecutor and  HotspotInstructionsExecutor.
42  *     3. Checks that results of execution are equals.
43  *     For generation instructions test using right parentheses sequence. Open parenthesis &quot;(&quot; is correspondent to
44  *     stack increasing instructions, &quot;)&quot; is corresponded stack decreasing instructions.
