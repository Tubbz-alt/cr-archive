 32  * DESCRIPTION
 33  *     The test verifies that MH logic is not affected by garbage collector and garbage collector
 34  *     correctly walks through references in MHs.
 35  *     The test has 3 threads:
 36  *     - Thread 1 creates sequences of MH (see vm/mlvm/mh/func/sequences test) and calls them
 37  *     - Thread 2 tries to overflow heap with different objects and arrays
 38  *     - Thread 3 periodically calls GC
