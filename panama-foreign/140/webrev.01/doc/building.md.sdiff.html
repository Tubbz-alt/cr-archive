 883 ## Running Tests
 884 
 885 Most of the JDK tests are using the [JTReg](http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg)
 886 test framework. Make sure that your configuration knows where to find your
 887 installation of JTReg. If this is not picked up automatically, use the
 888 `--with-jtreg=&lt;path to jtreg home&gt;` option to point to the JTReg framework.
 889 Note that this option should point to the JTReg home, i.e. the top directory,
 890 containing `lib/jtreg.jar` etc.
 891 
 892 The [Adoption Group](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Adoption) provides
 893 recent builds of jtreg [here](
<span class="line-modified"> 894 https://adopt-openjdk.ci.cloudbees.com/job/jtreg/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact).</span>
 895 Download the latest `.tar.gz` file, unpack it, and point `--with-jtreg` to the
 896 `jtreg` directory that you just unpacked.
 897 
 898 To execute the most basic tests (tier 1), use:
 899 ```
 900 make run-test-tier1
 901 ```
 902 
 903 For more details on how to run tests, please see the [Testing
 904 the JDK](testing.html) document.

 906 ## Cross-compiling
 907 
 908 Cross-compiling means using one platform (the *build* platform) to generate
 909 output that can ran on another platform (the *target* platform).
 910 
 911 The typical reason for cross-compiling is that the build is performed on a more
 912 powerful desktop computer, but the resulting binaries will be able to run on a
 913 different, typically low-performing system. Most of the complications that
 914 arise when building for embedded is due to this separation of *build* and
