141  * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,
142  * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
143  * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
144  * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
145  * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
146  * &lt;p&gt;
147  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;serial thread confinement&lt;/em&gt;; that is, ownership of a memory segment can change (see
148  * {@link #withOwnerThread(Thread)}). This allows, for instance, for two threads {@code A} and {@code B} to share
149  * a segment in a controlled, cooperative and race-free fashion.
150  * &lt;p&gt;
151  * In some cases, it might be useful for multiple threads to process the contents of the same memory segment concurrently
152  * (e.g. in the case of parallel processing); while memory segments provide strong confinement guarantees, it is possible
153  * to obtain a {@link Spliterator} from a segment, which can be used to slice the segment and allow multiple thread to
154  * work in parallel on disjoint segment slices (this assumes that the access mode {@link #ACQUIRE} is set).
155  * For instance, the following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:
156  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
157 MemorySegment segment = ...
