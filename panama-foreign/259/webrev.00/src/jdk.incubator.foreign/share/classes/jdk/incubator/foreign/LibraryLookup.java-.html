 35  * A native library lookup. Exposes lookup operation for searching symbols, see {@link LibraryLookup#lookup(String)}.
 36  * A given native library remains loaded as long as there is at least one &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; library lookup instance referring
 37  * to it.
 38  * &lt;p&gt;
 39  * Memory address instances generated by a library lookup will contain a strong reference to the originating lookup object,
 40  * therefore preventing library unloading; in turn method handle instances obtained from
 41  * {@link ForeignLinker#downcallHandle(Addressable, MethodType, FunctionDescriptor)}) also maintain a strong reference
 42  * to the memory address parameter used for their construction. This means that there is always a strong reachability chain
 43  * from a native method handle to a lookup object (the one that was used to lookup the native library symbol the method handle
 44  * refers to); this is useful to prevent situations where a native library is unloaded in the middle of a native call.
 45  * &lt;p&gt;
 46  * To allow for a library to be unloaded, a client will have to discard any strong references it
 47  * maintains, directly, or indirectly to a lookup object associated with given library.
