<span class="line-modified"> 34  * as &lt;em&gt;offsets&lt;/em&gt; into some underlying memory segment (see {@link #segment()} and {@link #segmentOffset()}).</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 35  * Since checked memory addresses feature both spatial and temporal bounds, these addresses can &lt;em&gt;safely&lt;/em&gt; be</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 36  * dereferenced using a memory access var handle (see {@link MemoryHandles}).</span>
<span class="line-removed"> 37  * &lt;p&gt;</span>

<span class="line-removed"> 41  * e.g. by calling the {@link #ofLong(long)} method.</span>

 44  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on

 46  * be used for comparisons.
 47  * &lt;p&gt;
 48  * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemoryAddress} directly.
 49  *
 50  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemoryAddress}
 51  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
