   * &lt;p&gt; Classes to support low-level, safe and efficient memory access.

<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * The first models a contiguous memory region, which can reside either inside or outside the Java heap; the latter models an address - which can</span>

<span class="udiff-line-added">+  * A memory segment represents the main access coordinate of a memory access var handle, which can be obtained</span>
   * using the combinator methods defined in the {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemoryHandles} class. Finally, the {@link jdk.incubator.foreign.MemoryLayout} class
   * hierarchy enables description of &lt;em&gt;memory layouts&lt;/em&gt; and basic operations such as computing the size in bytes of a given
   * layout, obtain its alignment requirements, and so on. Memory layouts also provide an alternate, more abstract way, to produce
   * memory access var handles, e.g. using &lt;a href=&quot;MemoryLayout.html#layout-paths&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;layout paths&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

   * in the general case, guaranteeing temporal safety can be hard, as multiple threads could attempt to access and/or close

   * memory segment is associated with an owner thread, which is the only thread that can either access or close the segment.
