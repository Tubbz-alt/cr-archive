   * A memory address models a reference into a memory location. Memory addresses are typically obtained using the
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * {@link MemorySegment#address()} method; such addresses are said to be &lt;em&gt;checked&lt;/em&gt;, and can be expressed</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * as &lt;em&gt;offsets&lt;/em&gt; into some underlying memory segment (see {@link #segment()} and {@link #segmentOffset()}).</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-  * Since checked memory addresses feature both spatial and temporal bounds, these addresses can &lt;em&gt;safely&lt;/em&gt; be</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * dereferenced using a memory access var handle (see {@link MemoryHandles}).</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * &lt;p&gt;</span>

<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * addresses do not feature known spatial or temporal bounds; as such, attempting a memory dereference operation</span>
<span class="udiff-line-removed">-  * using an unchecked memory address will result in a runtime exception. Unchecked addresses can be obtained</span>

<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * {@link MemorySegment#address()} method, and can refer to either off-heap or on-heap memory.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * Given an address, it is possible to compute its offset relative to a given segment, which can be useful</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+  * when performing memory dereference operations using a memory access var handle (see {@link MemoryHandles}).</span>

   * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
   * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
   * instances of {@code MemoryAddress} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
   * be used for comparisons.
