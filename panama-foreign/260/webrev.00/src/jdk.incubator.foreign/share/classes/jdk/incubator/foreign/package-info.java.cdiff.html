<span class="line-modified">!  * The first models a contiguous memory region, which can reside either inside or outside the Java heap; the latter models an address - which can</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * sometimes be expressed as an offset into a given segment. A memory address represents the main access coordinate of a memory access var handle, which can be obtained</span>

   * hierarchy enables description of &lt;em&gt;memory layouts&lt;/em&gt; and basic operations such as computing the size in bytes of a given
   * layout, obtain its alignment requirements, and so on. Memory layouts also provide an alternate, more abstract way, to produce
   * memory access var handles, e.g. using &lt;a href=&quot;MemoryLayout.html#layout-paths&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;layout paths&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

   * models such as this can be very convenient - clients do not have to remember to &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; a direct buffer - such models can also make it

<span class="line-modified">!  * This API provides strong safety guarantees when it comes to memory access. First, when dereferencing a memory segment using</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * a memory address, such an address is validated (upon access), to make sure that it does not point to a memory location</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * which resides &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment it refers to. We call this guarantee &lt;em&gt;spatial safety&lt;/em&gt;;</span>
   * in other words, access to memory segments is bounds-checked, in the same way as array access is, as described in
   * Section {@jls 15.10.4} of &lt;cite&gt;The Java Language Specification&lt;/cite&gt;.
   * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">!  * Since memory segments can be closed (see above), a memory address is also validated (upon access) to make sure that</span>
<span class="line-modified">!  * the segment it belongs to has not been closed prematurely. We call this guarantee &lt;em&gt;temporal safety&lt;/em&gt;. Note that,</span>
   * in the general case, guaranteeing temporal safety can be hard, as multiple threads could attempt to access and/or close
   * the same memory segment concurrently. The memory access API addresses this problem by imposing strong
   * &lt;a href=&quot;MemorySegment.html#thread-confinement&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;thread-confinement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; guarantees on memory segments: each
   * memory segment is associated with an owner thread, which is the only thread that can either access or close the segment.
