 32  * A memory address models a reference into a memory location. Memory addresses are typically obtained using the
 33  * {@link MemorySegment#address()} method, and can refer to either off-heap or on-heap memory.
 34  * Given an address, it is possible to compute its offset relative to a given segment, which can be useful
 35  * when performing memory dereference operations using a memory access var handle (see {@link MemoryHandles}).
 36  * &lt;p&gt;
 37  * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
 38  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 39  * instances of {@code MemoryAddress} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 40  * be used for comparisons.
 41  * &lt;p&gt;
 42  * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemoryAddress} directly.
 43  *
 44  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemoryAddress}
 45  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
 46  * explicitly permitted types.
 47  *
 48  * @implSpec
 49  * Implementations of this interface are immutable, thread-safe and &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;.
