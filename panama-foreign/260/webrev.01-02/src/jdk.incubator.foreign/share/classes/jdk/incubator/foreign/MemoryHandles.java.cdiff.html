   * A memory access var handle is associated with an access size {@code S} and an alignment constraint {@code B}
   * (both expressed in bytes). We say that a memory access operation is &lt;em&gt;fully aligned&lt;/em&gt; if it occurs
   * at a memory address {@code A} which is compatible with both alignment constraints {@code S} and {@code B}.
