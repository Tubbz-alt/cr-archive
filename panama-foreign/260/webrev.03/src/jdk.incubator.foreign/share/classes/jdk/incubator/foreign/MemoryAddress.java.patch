 /**
  * A memory address models a reference into a memory location. Memory addresses are typically obtained using the
- * {@link MemorySegment#address()} method; such addresses are said to be <em>checked</em>, and can be expressed
- * as <em>offsets</em> into some underlying memory segment (see {@link #segment()} and {@link #segmentOffset()}).
- * Since checked memory addresses feature both spatial and temporal bounds, these addresses can <em>safely</em> be
- * dereferenced using a memory access var handle (see {@link MemoryHandles}).
- * <p>
- * If an address does not have any associated segment, it is said to be <em>unchecked</em>. Unchecked memory
- * addresses do not feature known spatial or temporal bounds; as such, attempting a memory dereference operation
- * using an unchecked memory address will result in a runtime exception. Unchecked addresses can be obtained
- * e.g. by calling the {@link #ofLong(long)} method.
+ * {@link MemorySegment#address()} method, and can refer to either off-heap or on-heap memory.
+ * Given an address, it is possible to compute its offset relative to a given segment, which can be useful
+ * when performing memory dereference operations using a memory access var handle (see {@link MemoryHandles}).
  * <p>
  * All implementations of this interface must be <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>;
  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
  * instances of {@code MemoryAddress} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
  * be used for comparisons.
