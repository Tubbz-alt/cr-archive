   * of the allocation scope is known statically. If an application knows before-hand how much memory it needs to allocate the values it needs,
   * using a &lt;em&gt;bounded&lt;/em&gt; allocation scope will typically provide better performances than independently allocating the memory
   * for each value (e.g. using {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)}), or using an &lt;em&gt;unbounded&lt;/em&gt; allocation scope.
