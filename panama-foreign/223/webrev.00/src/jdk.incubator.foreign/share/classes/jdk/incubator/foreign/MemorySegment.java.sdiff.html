 45  * A memory segment models a contiguous region of memory. A memory segment is associated with both spatial
 46  * and temporal bounds. Spatial bounds ensure that memory access operations on a memory segment cannot affect a memory location
 47  * which falls &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment being accessed. Temporal bounds ensure that memory access
 48  * operations on a segment cannot occur after a memory segment has been closed (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}).
 49  * &lt;p&gt;
 50  * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
 51  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 52  * instances of {@code MemorySegment} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 53  * be used for comparisons.
 54  * &lt;p&gt;
 55  * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemorySegment} directly.
 56  *
 57  * &lt;h2&gt;Constructing memory segments from different sources&lt;/h2&gt;
 58  *
 59  * There are multiple ways to obtain a memory segment. First, memory segments backed by off-heap memory can
<span class="line-modified"> 60  * be allocated using one of the many factory methods provided (see {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(MemoryLayout)},</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 61  * {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)} and {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long, long)}). Memory segments obtained</span>
 62  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;native memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 63  * &lt;p&gt;
 64  * It is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing heap-allocated Java array,
<span class="line-modified"> 65  * using one of the provided factory methods (e.g. {@link MemorySegment#ofArray(int[])}). Memory segments obtained</span>
 66  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;array memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 67  * &lt;p&gt;
 68  * It is possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing Java byte buffer (see {@link ByteBuffer}),
<span class="line-modified"> 69  * using the factory method {@link MemorySegment#ofByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)}.</span>
 70  * Memory segments obtained in this way are called &lt;em&gt;buffer memory segments&lt;/em&gt;. Note that buffer memory segments might
 71  * be backed by native memory (as in the case of native memory segments) or heap memory (as in the case of array memory segments),
 72  * depending on the characteristics of the byte buffer instance the segment is associated with. For instance, a buffer memory
 73  * segment obtained from a byte buffer created with the {@link ByteBuffer#allocateDirect(int)} method will be backed
 74  * by native memory.
 75  * &lt;p&gt;
 76  * Finally, it is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by a memory-mapped file using the factory method
<span class="line-modified"> 77  * {@link MemorySegment#mapFromPath(Path, long, long, FileChannel.MapMode)}. Such memory segments are called &lt;em&gt;mapped memory segments&lt;/em&gt;</span>
 78  * (see {@link MappedMemorySegment}).
 79  * &lt;p&gt;
 80  * Array and buffer segments are effectively &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt; over existing memory regions which might outlive the
 81  * lifecycle of the segments derived from them, and can even be manipulated directly (e.g. via array access, or direct use
 82  * of the {@link ByteBuffer} API) by other clients. As a result, while sharing array or buffer segments is possible,
 83  * it is strongly advised that clients wishing to do so take extra precautions to make sure that the underlying memory sources
 84  * associated with such segments remain inaccessible, and that said memory sources are never aliased by more than one segment
 85  * at a time - e.g. so as to prevent concurrent modifications of the contents of an array, or buffer segment.
 86  *
 87  * &lt;h2&gt;Closing a memory segment&lt;/h2&gt;
 88  *
 89  * Memory segments are closed explicitly (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}). When a segment is closed, it is no longer
 90  * &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt; (see {@link #isAlive()}, and subsequent operation on the segment (or on any {@link MemoryAddress} instance
 91  * derived from it) will fail with {@link IllegalStateException}.
 92  * &lt;p&gt;
 93  * Closing a segment might trigger the releasing of the underlying memory resources associated with said segment, depending on
 94  * the kind of memory segment being considered:
 95  * &lt;ul&gt;
 96  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a native memory segment results in &lt;em&gt;freeing&lt;/em&gt; the native memory associated with it&lt;/li&gt;
 97  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a mapped memory segment results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped&lt;/li&gt;

115  * is going to be accessed.
116  *
117  * &lt;h2&gt;Memory segment views&lt;/h2&gt;
118  *
119  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, it is possible to alter the set of supported access modes,
120  * by creating an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; view of a memory segment, as follows:
121  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
122 MemorySegment segment = ...
123 MemorySegment roSegment = segment.withAccessModes(segment.accessModes() &amp; ~WRITE);
124  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
125  * It is also possible to create views whose spatial bounds are stricter than the ones of the original segment
126  * (see {@link MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long)}).
127  * &lt;p&gt;
128  * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
129  * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
130  * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
131  * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as removing {@link #CLOSE}
132  * from the set of supported access modes, before sharing the view with another client.
133  * &lt;p&gt;
134  * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
<span class="line-modified">135  * (see {@link #asByteBuffer()}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the</span>
136  * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
137  * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory segment from which they originated.
138  *
139  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;thread-confinement&quot;&gt;Thread confinement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
140  *
141  * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,
142  * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
143  * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
144  * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
145  * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
146  * &lt;p&gt;
147  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;serial thread confinement&lt;/em&gt;; that is, ownership of a memory segment can change (see
148  * {@link #withOwnerThread(Thread)}). This allows, for instance, for two threads {@code A} and {@code B} to share
149  * a segment in a controlled, cooperative and race-free fashion.
150  * &lt;p&gt;
151  * In some cases, it might be useful for multiple threads to process the contents of the same memory segment concurrently
152  * (e.g. in the case of parallel processing); while memory segments provide strong confinement guarantees, it is possible
153  * to obtain a {@link Spliterator} from a segment, which can be used to slice the segment and allow multiple thread to
154  * work in parallel on disjoint segment slices (this assumes that the access mode {@link #ACQUIRE} is set).
155  * For instance, the following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:
</pre>
<hr />
<pre>
162                        .sum();
163  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
164  *
165  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
166  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
167  * {@link MappedMemorySegment} and other explicitly permitted subtypes.
168  *
169  * @implSpec
170  * Implementations of this interface are immutable, thread-safe and &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;.

 36  * A memory segment models a contiguous region of memory. A memory segment is associated with both spatial
 37  * and temporal bounds. Spatial bounds ensure that memory access operations on a memory segment cannot affect a memory location
 38  * which falls &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the boundaries of the memory segment being accessed. Temporal bounds ensure that memory access
 39  * operations on a segment cannot occur after a memory segment has been closed (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}).
 40  * &lt;p&gt;
 41  * All implementations of this interface must be &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;;
 42  * use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on
 43  * instances of {@code MemorySegment} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided. The {@code equals} method should
 44  * be used for comparisons.
 45  * &lt;p&gt;
 46  * Non-platform classes should not implement {@linkplain MemorySegment} directly.
 47  *
 48  * &lt;h2&gt;Constructing memory segments from different sources&lt;/h2&gt;
 49  *
 50  * There are multiple ways to obtain a memory segment. First, memory segments backed by off-heap memory can
<span class="line-modified"> 51  * be allocated using one of the many factory methods provided (see {@link MemorySegments#allocateNative(MemoryLayout)},</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 52  * {@link MemorySegments#allocateNative(long)} and {@link MemorySegments#allocateNative(long, long)}). Memory segments obtained</span>
 53  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;native memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 54  * &lt;p&gt;
 55  * It is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing heap-allocated Java array,
<span class="line-modified"> 56  * using one of the provided factory methods (e.g. {@link MemorySegments#ofArray(int[])}). Memory segments obtained</span>
 57  * in this way are called &lt;em&gt;array memory segments&lt;/em&gt;.
 58  * &lt;p&gt;
 59  * It is possible to obtain a memory segment backed by an existing Java byte buffer (see {@link ByteBuffer}),
<span class="line-modified"> 60  * using the factory method {@link MemorySegments#ofByteBuffer(ByteBuffer)}.</span>
 61  * Memory segments obtained in this way are called &lt;em&gt;buffer memory segments&lt;/em&gt;. Note that buffer memory segments might
 62  * be backed by native memory (as in the case of native memory segments) or heap memory (as in the case of array memory segments),
 63  * depending on the characteristics of the byte buffer instance the segment is associated with. For instance, a buffer memory
 64  * segment obtained from a byte buffer created with the {@link ByteBuffer#allocateDirect(int)} method will be backed
 65  * by native memory.
 66  * &lt;p&gt;
 67  * Finally, it is also possible to obtain a memory segment backed by a memory-mapped file using the factory method
<span class="line-modified"> 68  * {@link MemorySegments#mapFromPath(Path, long, long, FileChannel.MapMode)}. Such memory segments are called &lt;em&gt;mapped memory segments&lt;/em&gt;</span>
 69  * (see {@link MappedMemorySegment}).
 70  * &lt;p&gt;
 71  * Array and buffer segments are effectively &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt; over existing memory regions which might outlive the
 72  * lifecycle of the segments derived from them, and can even be manipulated directly (e.g. via array access, or direct use
 73  * of the {@link ByteBuffer} API) by other clients. As a result, while sharing array or buffer segments is possible,
 74  * it is strongly advised that clients wishing to do so take extra precautions to make sure that the underlying memory sources
 75  * associated with such segments remain inaccessible, and that said memory sources are never aliased by more than one segment
 76  * at a time - e.g. so as to prevent concurrent modifications of the contents of an array, or buffer segment.
 77  *
 78  * &lt;h2&gt;Closing a memory segment&lt;/h2&gt;
 79  *
 80  * Memory segments are closed explicitly (see {@link MemorySegment#close()}). When a segment is closed, it is no longer
 81  * &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt; (see {@link #isAlive()}, and subsequent operation on the segment (or on any {@link MemoryAddress} instance
 82  * derived from it) will fail with {@link IllegalStateException}.
 83  * &lt;p&gt;
 84  * Closing a segment might trigger the releasing of the underlying memory resources associated with said segment, depending on
 85  * the kind of memory segment being considered:
 86  * &lt;ul&gt;
 87  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a native memory segment results in &lt;em&gt;freeing&lt;/em&gt; the native memory associated with it&lt;/li&gt;
 88  *     &lt;li&gt;closing a mapped memory segment results in the backing memory-mapped file to be unmapped&lt;/li&gt;

106  * is going to be accessed.
107  *
108  * &lt;h2&gt;Memory segment views&lt;/h2&gt;
109  *
110  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;views&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, it is possible to alter the set of supported access modes,
111  * by creating an &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt; view of a memory segment, as follows:
112  * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{@code
113 MemorySegment segment = ...
114 MemorySegment roSegment = segment.withAccessModes(segment.accessModes() &amp; ~WRITE);
115  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
116  * It is also possible to create views whose spatial bounds are stricter than the ones of the original segment
117  * (see {@link MemorySegment#asSlice(long, long)}).
118  * &lt;p&gt;
119  * Temporal bounds of the original segment are inherited by the view; that is, closing a segment view, such as a sliced
120  * view, will cause the original segment to be closed; as such special care must be taken when sharing views
121  * between multiple clients. If a client want to protect itself against early closure of a segment by
122  * another actor, it is the responsibility of that client to take protective measures, such as removing {@link #CLOSE}
123  * from the set of supported access modes, before sharing the view with another client.
124  * &lt;p&gt;
125  * To allow for interoperability with existing code, a byte buffer view can be obtained from a memory segment
<span class="line-modified">126  * (see {@link MemorySegments#asByteBuffer(MemorySegment)}). This can be useful, for instance, for those clients that want to keep using the</span>
127  * {@link ByteBuffer} API, but need to operate on large memory segments. Byte buffers obtained in such a way support
128  * the same spatial and temporal access restrictions associated to the memory segment from which they originated.
129  *
130  * &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id = &quot;thread-confinement&quot;&gt;Thread confinement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
131  *
132  * Memory segments support strong thread-confinement guarantees. Upon creation, they are assigned an &lt;em&gt;owner thread&lt;/em&gt;,
133  * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
134  * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
135  * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
136  * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
137  * &lt;p&gt;
138  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;serial thread confinement&lt;/em&gt;; that is, ownership of a memory segment can change (see
139  * {@link #withOwnerThread(Thread)}). This allows, for instance, for two threads {@code A} and {@code B} to share
140  * a segment in a controlled, cooperative and race-free fashion.
141  * &lt;p&gt;
142  * In some cases, it might be useful for multiple threads to process the contents of the same memory segment concurrently
143  * (e.g. in the case of parallel processing); while memory segments provide strong confinement guarantees, it is possible
144  * to obtain a {@link Spliterator} from a segment, which can be used to slice the segment and allow multiple thread to
145  * work in parallel on disjoint segment slices (this assumes that the access mode {@link #ACQUIRE} is set).
146  * For instance, the following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:
</pre>
<hr />
<pre>
153                        .sum();
154  * }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
155  *
156  * @apiNote In the future, if the Java language permits, {@link MemorySegment}
157  * may become a {@code sealed} interface, which would prohibit subclassing except by
158  * {@link MappedMemorySegment} and other explicitly permitted subtypes.
159  *
160  * @implSpec
161  * Implementations of this interface are immutable, thread-safe and &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html&quot;&gt;value-based&lt;/a&gt;.
