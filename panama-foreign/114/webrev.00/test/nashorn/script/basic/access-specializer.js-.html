25  * This is a simple test that checks that access specialization in FinalizeTypes is consistent.
26  * Here, a2 = 0 will be turned int {I}a2 = 0, and all would be fine and well, only we can&#39;t change
27  * the symbol type for a2 from double, and we can&#39;t as it&#39;s not a temporary. Either we have to put
28  * a temporary in at the late finalize stage and add another assignment, or we genericize the check
29  * in CodeGenerator#Store so we detect whether a target is of the wrong type before storing. It
30  * is hopefully very rare, and will only be a problem when assignment results that have been
31  * specialized live on the stack
