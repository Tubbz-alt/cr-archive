 313  *      &lt;LI&gt; &lt;em&gt;Enabled&lt;/em&gt; cipher suites, which may be fewer than
 314  *      the full set of supported suites.  This group is set using the
 315  *      {@link #setEnabledCipherSuites(String [])} method, and
 316  *      queried using the {@link #getEnabledCipherSuites()} method.
 317  *      Initially, a default set of cipher suites will be enabled on a
 318  *      new engine that represents the minimum suggested
 319  *      configuration.
 320  * &lt;/UL&gt;
 321  *
 322  * Implementation defaults require that only cipher suites which
 323  * authenticate servers and provide confidentiality be enabled by
 324  * default.  Only if both sides explicitly agree to unauthenticated
 325  * and/or non-private (unencrypted) communications will such a
 326  * cipher suite be selected.
 327  * &lt;P&gt;
 328  * Each SSL/TLS/DTLS connection must have one client and one server, thus
 329  * each endpoint must decide which role to assume.  This choice determines
 330  * who begins the handshaking process as well as which type of messages
 331  * should be sent by each party.  The method {@link
<span class="line-modified"> 332  * #setUseClientMode(boolean)} configures the mode.  Once the initial</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 333  * handshaking has started, an {@code SSLEngine} can not switch</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 334  * between client and server modes, even when performing renegotiations.</span>



 335  * &lt;P&gt;
 336  * Applications might choose to process delegated tasks in different
 337  * threads.  When an {@code SSLEngine}
 338  * is created, the current {@link java.security.AccessControlContext}
 339  * is saved.  All future delegated tasks will be processed using this
 340  * context:  that is, all access control decisions will be made using the
 341  * context captured at engine creation.
 342  *
 343  * &lt;HR&gt;

 345  * &lt;B&gt;Concurrency Notes&lt;/B&gt;:
 346  * There are two concurrency issues to be aware of:
 347  *
 348  * &lt;OL&gt;
 349  *      &lt;li&gt;The {@code wrap()} and {@code unwrap()} methods
 350  *      may execute concurrently of each other.
 351  *
 352  *      &lt;li&gt; The SSL/TLS/DTLS protocols employ ordered packets.
 353  *      Applications must take care to ensure that generated packets
 354  *      are delivered in sequence.  If packets arrive
