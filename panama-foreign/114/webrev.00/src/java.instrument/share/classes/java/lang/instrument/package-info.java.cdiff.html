  /**
   * Provides services that allow Java programming language agents to instrument
   * programs running on the JVM. The mechanism for instrumentation is modification
   * of the byte-codes of methods.
   *
<span class="line-added">+  * &lt;p&gt; Note: developers/admininstrators are responsible for verifying</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * the trustworthiness of content and structure of the Java Agents they deploy,</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * since those are able to arbitrarily transform the bytecode from other JAR files.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * Since that happens after the Jars containing the bytecode have been verified</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * as trusted, the trustworthiness of a Java Agent can determine the trust towards</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * the entire program.</span>

   * &lt;p&gt; An agent is deployed as a JAR file. An attribute in the JAR file manifest
   * specifies the agent class which will be loaded to start the agent. Agents can
   * be started in several ways:
