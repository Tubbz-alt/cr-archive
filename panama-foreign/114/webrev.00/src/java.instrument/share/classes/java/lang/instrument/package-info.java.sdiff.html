 31  * Provides services that allow Java programming language agents to instrument
 32  * programs running on the JVM. The mechanism for instrumentation is modification
 33  * of the byte-codes of methods.
 34  *







 35  * &lt;p&gt; An agent is deployed as a JAR file. An attribute in the JAR file manifest
 36  * specifies the agent class which will be loaded to start the agent. Agents can
 37  * be started in several ways:
 38  *
 39  * &lt;ol&gt;
 40  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; For implementations that support a command-line interface, an agent
 41  *   can be started by specifying an option on the command-line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 42  *
 43  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; An implementation may support a mechanism to start agents some time
 44  *   after the VM has started. For example, an implementation may provide a
 45  *   mechanism that allows a tool to &lt;i&gt;attach&lt;/i&gt; to a running application, and
 46  *   initiate the loading of the tool&#39;s agent into the running application. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 47  *
 48  *   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; An agent may be packaged with an application in an executable JAR
 49  *   file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
