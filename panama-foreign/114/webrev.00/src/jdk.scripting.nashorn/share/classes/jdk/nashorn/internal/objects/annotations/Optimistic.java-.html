34  * The Optimistic annotation is used for builtins that can throw UnwarrantedOptimism
35  * exception if they are wrong, whose callsite is optimistic and contains a program
36  * point. Every optimistic builtin callsite needs to bind its programPoint to an
37  * argument of the implementation at compile time
38  *
39  * Typical use case would be something like: if you want to do an optimistic &quot;push&quot; function
40  * in NativeArray that takes an int, write
41  *
42  *  &lt;pre&gt;
43  *  {@literal @}SpecializedFunction {@literal @}Optimistic
44  *  public static int push(final Object self, final int x, final int programPoint) {
45  *    try {
46  *    //push code assuming that this is an int array
47  *    //return new length of array, assuming it&#39;s an int
48  *    } catch (ArrayWasWrong e) {
49  *       //undo any array modifications
50  *       throw new UnwarrantedOptimismExceptionArrayType(x, programPoint);
51  *    } catch (LengthOverFlowed e) {
52  *       //undo any array modifications
53  *       throw new UnwarratnedOptimismExceptionArrayLength(uint32lenThatOverFlowed, programPoint)
54  *    }
