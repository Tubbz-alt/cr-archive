27  * This package provides the {@code javax.script} integration, which is the preferred way to use Nashorn.
28  * You will ordinarily do this to obtain an instance of a Nashorn script engine:
29  * &lt;pre&gt;
30  * import javax.script.*;
31  * ...
32  * ScriptEngine nashornEngine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(&quot;Nashorn&quot;);
33  * &lt;/pre&gt;
34  * &lt;p&gt;Nashorn script engines implement the optional {@link javax.script.Invocable} and {@link javax.script.Compilable}
35  * interfaces, allowing for efficient pre-compilation and repeated execution of scripts. In addition,
36  * this package provides nashorn specific extension classes, interfaces and methods. See
37  * {@link jdk.nashorn.api.scripting.NashornScriptEngineFactory} for further details.
38  *
39  * @since 1.8u40
