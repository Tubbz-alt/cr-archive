   * In some cases, it might be useful for multiple threads to process the contents of the same memory segment concurrently
   * (e.g. in the case of parallel processing); while memory segments provide strong confinement guarantees, it is possible
   * to obtain a {@link Spliterator} from a segment, which can be used to slice the segment and allow multiple thread to
   * work in parallel on disjoint segment slices (this assumes that the access mode {@link #ACQUIRE} is set).
   * For instance, the following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:
