   * typically the thread which initiated the creation operation. After creation, only the owner thread will be allowed
   * to directly manipulate the memory segment (e.g. close the memory segment) or access the underlying memory associated with
   * the segment using a memory access var handle. Any attempt to perform such operations from a thread other than the
   * owner thread will result in a runtime failure.
   * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-added">+  * Memory segments support &lt;em&gt;serial thread confinement&lt;/em&gt;; that is, ownership of a memory segment can change (see</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * {@link #withOwnerThread(Thread)}). This allows, for instance, for two threads {@code A} and {@code B} to share</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * a segment in a controlled, cooperative and race-free fashion.</span>
<span class="line-added">+  * &lt;p&gt;</span>
   * In some cases, it might be useful for multiple threads to process the contents of the same memory segment concurrently
   * (e.g. in the case of parallel processing); while memory segments provide strong confinement guarantees, it is possible
   * to obtain a {@link Spliterator} from a segment, which can be used to slice the segment and allow multiple thread to
   * work in parallel on disjoint segment slices (this assumes that the access mode {@link #ACQUIRE} is set).
   * For instance, the following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:
