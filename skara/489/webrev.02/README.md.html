  1 # OpenJDK Project Skara
  2 
  3 The goal of Project Skara is to investigate alternative SCM and code review
  4 options for the OpenJDK source code, including options based upon Git rather than
  5 Mercurial, and including options hosted by third parties.
  6 
  7 This repository contains tooling for working with OpenJDK projects and
  8 their repositories. The following CLI tools are available as part of this
  9 repository:
 10 
 11 - git-jcheck - a backwards compatible Git port of [jcheck](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/)
 12 - git-webrev - a backwards compatible Git port of [webrev](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/webrev/)
 13 - git-defpath - a backwards compatible Git port of [defpath](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/defpath/)
 14 - git-fork - fork a project on an external Git source code hosting provider to your personal space and optionally clone it
 15 - git-sync - sync the personal fork of the project with the current state of the upstream repository
 16 - git-pr - interact with pull requests for a project on an external Git source code hosting provider
 17 - git-info - show OpenJDK information about commits, e.g. issue links, authors, contributors, etc.
 18 - git-token - interact with a Git credential manager for handling personal access tokens
 19 - git-translate - translate between [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/)
 20 and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) hashes
 21 - git-skara - learn about and update the Skara CLI tools
 22 - git-publish - publishes a local branch to a remote repository
 23 
 24 There are also CLI tools available for importing OpenJDK
 25 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) repositories into
 26 [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repositories and vice versa:
 27 
 28 - git-openjdk-import
 29 - git-verify-import
 30 - hg-openjdk-import
 31 
 32 The following server-side tools (so called &quot;bots&quot;) for interacting with
 33 external Git source code hosting providers are available:
 34 
 35 - hgbridge - continuously convert Mercurial repositories to git
 36 - mlbridge - bridge messages between mailing lists and pull requests
 37 - notify - send email notifications when repositories are updated
 38 - pr - add OpenJDK workflow support for pull requests
 39 - submit - example pull request test runner
 40 
 41 ## Building
 42 
 43 [JDK 12](http://jdk.java.net/12/) or later and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
 44 5.6.2 or later is required for building. To build the project on macOS or
 45 GNU/Linux x64, just run the following command from the source tree root:
 46 
 47 ```bash
 48 $ sh gradlew
 49 ```
 50 
 51 To build the project on Windows x64, run the following command from the source tree root:
 52 
 53 ```bat
 54 &gt; gradlew
 55 ```
 56 
 57 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 58 tree root.
 59 
 60 ### Other operating systems and CPU architectures
 61 
 62 If you want to build on an operating system other than GNU/Linux, macOS or
 63 Windows _or_ if you want to build on a CPU architecture other than x64, then
 64 ensure that you have JDK 12 or later installed locally. You can then run the
 65 following command from the source tree root:
 66 
 67 ```bash
 68 $ sh gradlew
 69 ```
 70 
 71 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 72 tree root.
 73 
 74 ### Offline builds
 75 
 76 If you don&#39;t want the build to automatically download any dependencies, then
 77 you must ensure that you have installed the following software locally:
 78 
 79 - JDK 12 or later
 80 - Gradle 5.6.2 or later
 81 
 82 To create a build then run the command:
 83 
 84 ```bash
 85 $ gradle offline
 86 ```
 87 
 88 _Please note_ that the above command does _not_ make use of `gradlew` to avoid
 89 downloading Gradle.
 90 
 91 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 92 tree root.
 93 
 94 ### Cross-linking
 95 
 96 It is also supported to cross-jlink jimages to GNU/Linux, macOS and/or Windows from
 97 any of the aforementioned operating systems. To build all applicable jimages
 98 (including the server-side tooling), run the following command from the
 99 source tree root:
100 
101 ```bash
102 sh gradlew images
103 ```
104 
105 ## Installing
106 
107 To install the Skara tools, include the `skara.gitconfig` Git configuration
108 file in your user-level Git configuration file. On macOS or
109 GNU/Linux:
110 
111 ```bash
112 $ git config --global include.path &quot;$PWD/skara.gitconfig&quot;
113 ```
114 
115 On Windows:
116 
117 ```bat
118 &gt; git config --global include.path &quot;%CD%/skara.gitconfig&quot;
119 ```
120 
121 To check that everything works as expected, run the command `git skara help`.
122 
123 ## Testing
124 
125 [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) 5.5.1 or later is required to run the unit
126 tests. To run the tests, execute following command from the source tree root:
127 
128 ```bash
129 $ sh gradlew test
130 ```
131 
132 The tests expect [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.19.1 or later and
133 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) 4.7.1 or later to be installed on
134 your system.
135 
136 This repository also contains a Dockerfile, `test.dockerfile`, that allows
137 for running the tests in a reproducible way with the proper dependencies
138 configured. To run the tests in this way, run the following command from the
139 source tree root:
140 
141 ```bash
142 $ sh gradlew reproduce
143 ```
144 
145 ## Developing
146 
147 There are no additional dependencies required for developing Skara if you
148 already have managed to build and test it. The following sections describes how
149 you can set up various text editors and/or IDEs for working on Skara.
150 
151 ### IntelliJ IDEA
152 
153 Skara has support for [IntellJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) out of the
154 box, both the &quot;Community&quot; edition and the &quot;Ultimate&quot; edition. To work on Skara
155 with IntelliJ IDEA you only have to &quot;Open&quot; the Skara directory.
156 
157 If you do not have a JDK 13 SDK set up in IntelliJ IDEA, then you need to set
158 one up. IntelliJ IDEA will prompt you to set up a &quot;Project SDK&quot; when you open
159 any Skara Java source code file. Press the &quot;Setup SDK&quot; button in the blue bar at
160 the top of the Java source code file, then press &quot;Configure&quot; in the new dialog,
161 then press the little &quot;+&quot; button in top-left corner in the next dialog and
162 select a path containing a [JDK 13](https://jdk.java.net/13) home directory.
163 
164 There are currently three run configurations provided:
165 
166 - `Images` - create all jlinked images
167 - `Test` - run all tests
168 - `Clean` - remove all build and test artifacts
169 
170 To run any of the above configurations, click the &quot;Run&quot; top-level menu and then
171 the &quot;Run...&quot; action (by default bound to the Alt+Shift+F10 key combination).
172
