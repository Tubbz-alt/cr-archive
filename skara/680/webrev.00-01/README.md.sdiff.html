147 The Skara tools can also be added to `$PATH` on GNU/Linux and macOS and Git
148 will pick them up. You can either just extend `$PATH` with the `build/bin`
149 directory or you can copy the tools to a location already on `$PATH`. To extend
150 `$PATH` with the `build/bin` directory, run:
151 
152 ```bash
153 $ sh gradlew
154 $ export PATH=&quot;$PWD/build/bin:$PATH&quot;
155 ```
156 
157 To copy the tools to a location already on `$PATH`, run:
158 
159 ```bash
160 $ make
161 $ make install prefix=/path/to/install/location
162 ```
163 
164 When running `make install` the default value of `prefix` is `$HOME/.local`.
165 
166 If you want `git help &lt;skara tool&gt;` (or the equivalent `man git-&lt;skara tool&gt;`
<span class="line-modified">167 to work, you must also add the `cli/resources/man` directory to `$MANPATH`.</span>
168 For instance, run this from the Skara top directory to add this to your
169 `.bashrc` file:
170 
171 ```
<span class="line-modified">172 echo &quot;export MANPATH=\$MANPATH&quot;:$PWD/cli/resources/man &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc</span>
173 ```
174 
175 ## Testing
176 
177 [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) 5.6.2 or later is required to run the unit
178 tests. To run the tests, execute following command from the source tree root:
179 
180 ```bash
181 $ sh gradlew test
182 ```
183 
184 If you prefer to use the Makefile wrapper you can also run:
185 
186 ```bash
187 $ make test
188 ```
189 
190 The tests expect [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.19.3 or later and
191 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) 4.7.2 or later to be installed on
192 your system.
