  3 The goal of Project Skara is to investigate alternative SCM and code review
  4 options for the OpenJDK source code, including options based upon Git rather than
  5 Mercurial, and including options hosted by third parties.
  6 
  7 This repository contains tooling for working with OpenJDK projects and
  8 their repositories. The following CLI tools are available as part of this
  9 repository:
 10 
 11 - git-jcheck - a backwards compatible Git port of [jcheck](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/)
 12 - git-webrev - a backwards compatible Git port of [webrev](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/webrev/)
 13 - git-defpath - a backwards compatible Git port of [defpath](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/defpath/)
 14 - git-fork - fork a project on an external Git source code hosting provider to your personal space and optionally clone it
 15 - git-sync - sync the personal fork of the project with the current state of the upstream repository
 16 - git-pr - interact with pull requests for a project on an external Git source code hosting provider
 17 - git-info - show OpenJDK information about commits, e.g. issue links, authors, contributors, etc.
 18 - git-token - interact with a Git credential manager for handling personal access tokens
 19 - git-translate - translate between [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/)
 20 and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) hashes
 21 - git-skara - learn about and update the Skara CLI tools

 22 - git-publish - publishes a local branch to a remote repository
 23 
 24 There are also CLI tools available for importing OpenJDK
 25 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) repositories into
 26 [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repositories and vice versa:
 27 
 28 - git-openjdk-import
 29 - git-verify-import
 30 - hg-openjdk-import
 31 
 32 The following server-side tools (so called &quot;bots&quot;) for interacting with
 33 external Git source code hosting providers are available:
 34 
 35 - hgbridge - continuously convert Mercurial repositories to git
 36 - mlbridge - bridge messages between mailing lists and pull requests
 37 - notify - send email notifications when repositories are updated
 38 - pr - add OpenJDK workflow support for pull requests
 39 - submit - example pull request test runner
 40 - forward - forward commits to various repositories
 41 - mirror - mirror repositories
 42 - merge - merge commits between different repositories and/or branches
 43 - test - test runner
 44 
 45 ## Building
 46 
<span class="line-modified"> 47 [JDK 13](http://jdk.java.net/13/) or later and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 48 6.0 or later is required for building. To build the project on macOS or</span>
 49 GNU/Linux x64, just run the following command from the source tree root:
 50 
 51 ```bash
 52 $ sh gradlew
 53 ```
 54 
 55 To build the project on Windows x64, run the following command from the source tree root:
 56 
 57 ```bat
 58 &gt; gradlew
 59 ```
 60 
 61 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 62 tree root. _Note_ that the above commands will build the CLI tools, if you
 63 also want to build the bot images run `sh gradlew images` on GNU/Linux or
 64 `gradlew images` on Windows.
 65 
 66 ### Other operating systems and CPU architectures
 67 
 68 If you want to build on an operating system other than GNU/Linux, macOS or
 69 Windows _or_ if you want to build on a CPU architecture other than x64, then
<span class="line-modified"> 70 ensure that you have JDK 13 or later installed locally. You can then run the</span>
 71 following command from the source tree root:
 72 
 73 ```bash
 74 $ sh gradlew
 75 ```
 76 
 77 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 78 tree root.
 79 
 80 ### Offline builds
 81 
 82 If you don&#39;t want the build to automatically download any dependencies, then
 83 you must ensure that you have installed the following software locally:
 84 
<span class="line-modified"> 85 - JDK 13 or later</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 86 - Gradle 6.0 or later</span>
 87 
 88 To create a build then run the command:
 89 
 90 ```bash
 91 $ gradle offline
 92 ```
 93 
 94 _Please note_ that the above command does _not_ make use of `gradlew` to avoid
 95 downloading Gradle.
 96 
 97 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 98 tree root.
 99 
100 ### Cross-linking
101 
102 It is also supported to cross-jlink jimages to GNU/Linux, macOS and/or Windows from
103 any of the aforementioned operating systems. To build all applicable jimages
104 (including the server-side tooling), run the following command from the
105 source tree root:
106 
</pre>
<hr />
<pre>
147 will pick them up. You can either just extend `$PATH` with the `build/bin`
148 directory or you can copy the tools to a location already on `$PATH`. To extend
149 `$PATH` with the `build/bin` directory, run:
150 
151 ```bash
152 $ sh gradlew
153 $ export PATH=&quot;$PWD/build/bin:$PATH&quot;
154 ```
155 
156 To copy the tools to a location already on `$PATH`, run:
157 
158 ```bash
159 $ make
160 $ make install prefix=/path/to/install/location
161 ```
162 
163 When running `make install` the default value of `prefix` is `$HOME/.local`.
164 
165 ## Testing
166 
<span class="line-modified">167 [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) 5.5.2 or later is required to run the unit</span>
168 tests. To run the tests, execute following command from the source tree root:
169 
170 ```bash
171 $ sh gradlew test
172 ```
173 
174 If you prefer to use the Makefile wrapper you can also run:
175 
176 ```bash
177 $ make test
178 ```
179 
180 The tests expect [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.19.3 or later and
181 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) 4.7.2 or later to be installed on
182 your system.
183 
184 This repository also contains a Dockerfile, `test.dockerfile`, that allows
185 for running the tests in a reproducible way with the proper dependencies
186 configured. To run the tests in this way, run the following command from the
187 source tree root:
