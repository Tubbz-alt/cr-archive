  ## Building
  
<span class="line-modified">! [JDK 13](http://jdk.java.net/13/) or later and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)</span>
<span class="line-modified">! 6.0 or later is required for building. To build the project on macOS or</span>
  GNU/Linux x64, just run the following command from the source tree root:
  
  ```bash
  $ sh gradlew
  ```
</pre>
<hr />
<pre>
<span class="line-old-header">*** 53,17 ***</span>
  ```bat
  &gt; gradlew
  ```
  
  The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
<span class="line-modified">! tree root.</span>
  
  ### Other operating systems and CPU architectures
  
  If you want to build on an operating system other than GNU/Linux, macOS or
  Windows _or_ if you want to build on a CPU architecture other than x64, then
<span class="line-modified">! ensure that you have JDK 12 or later installed locally. You can then run the</span>
  following command from the source tree root:
  
  ```bash
  $ sh gradlew
  ```
<span class="line-new-header">--- 57,19 ---</span>
  ```bat
  &gt; gradlew
  ```
  
  The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
<span class="line-modified">! tree root. _Note_ that the above commands will build the CLI tools, if you</span>
<span class="line-added">+ also want to build the bot images run `sh gradlew images` on GNU/Linux or</span>
<span class="line-added">+ `gradlew images` on Windows.</span>
  
  ### Other operating systems and CPU architectures
  
  If you want to build on an operating system other than GNU/Linux, macOS or
  Windows _or_ if you want to build on a CPU architecture other than x64, then
<span class="line-modified">! ensure that you have JDK 13 or later installed locally. You can then run the</span>

  ### Offline builds
  
  If you don&#39;t want the build to automatically download any dependencies, then
  you must ensure that you have installed the following software locally:
  
<span class="line-modified">! - JDK 12 or later</span>
<span class="line-modified">! - Gradle 5.6.2 or later</span>
  
  To create a build then run the command:
  
  ```bash
  $ gradle offline

<span class="line-added">+ ### Makefile wrapper</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ Skara also has a very thin Makefile wrapper for contributors who prefer to build</span>
<span class="line-added">+ using `make`. To build the jlinked image for the CLI tools using `make`, run:</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ ```bash</span>
<span class="line-added">+ make</span>
<span class="line-added">+ ```</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
  ## Installing
  
<span class="line-added">+ There are multiple way to install the Skara CLI tools. The easiest way is to</span>
<span class="line-added">+ just include `skara.gitconfig` in your global Git configuration file. You can also</span>
<span class="line-added">+ install the Skara tools on your `$PATH`.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ ### Including skara.gitconfig</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
  To install the Skara tools, include the `skara.gitconfig` Git configuration
  file in your user-level Git configuration file. On macOS or
  GNU/Linux:
  
  ```bash
</pre>
<hr />
<pre>
<span class="line-old-header">*** 118,21 ***</span>
  &gt; git config --global include.path &quot;%CD%/skara.gitconfig&quot;
  ```
  
  To check that everything works as expected, run the command `git skara help`.
  
  ## Testing
  
<span class="line-modified">! [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) 5.5.1 or later is required to run the unit</span>
  tests. To run the tests, execute following command from the source tree root:
  
  ```bash
  $ sh gradlew test
  ```
  
<span class="line-modified">! The tests expect [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.19.1 or later and</span>
<span class="line-modified">! [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) 4.7.1 or later to be installed on</span>
  your system.
  
  This repository also contains a Dockerfile, `test.dockerfile`, that allows
  for running the tests in a reproducible way with the proper dependencies
  configured. To run the tests in this way, run the following command from the
<span class="line-new-header">--- 139,48 ---</span>
  &gt; git config --global include.path &quot;%CD%/skara.gitconfig&quot;
  ```
  
  To check that everything works as expected, run the command `git skara help`.
  
<span class="line-added">+ ### Adding to PATH</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ The Skara tools can also be added to `$PATH` on GNU/Linux and macOS and Git</span>
<span class="line-added">+ will pick them up. You can either just extend `$PATH` with the `build/bin`</span>
<span class="line-added">+ directory or you can copy the tools to a location already on `$PATH`. To extend</span>
<span class="line-added">+ `$PATH` with the `build/bin` directory, run:</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ ```bash</span>
<span class="line-added">+ $ sh gradlew</span>
<span class="line-added">+ $ export PATH=&quot;$PWD/build/bin:$PATH&quot;</span>
<span class="line-added">+ ```</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ To copy the tools to a location already on `$PATH`, run:</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ ```bash</span>
<span class="line-added">+ $ make</span>
<span class="line-added">+ $ make install prefix=/path/to/install/location</span>
<span class="line-added">+ ```</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ When running `make install` the default value of `prefix` is `$HOME/.local`.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
  ## Testing
  
<span class="line-modified">! [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) 5.5.2 or later is required to run the unit</span>
  tests. To run the tests, execute following command from the source tree root:
  
  ```bash
  $ sh gradlew test
  ```
  
<span class="line-modified">! If you prefer to use the Makefile wrapper you can also run:</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-added">+ ```bash</span>
<span class="line-added">+ $ make test</span>
<span class="line-added">+ ```</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ The tests expect [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.19.3 or later and</span>
<span class="line-added">+ [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) 4.7.2 or later to be installed on</span>
  your system.
  
  This repository also contains a Dockerfile, `test.dockerfile`, that allows
  for running the tests in a reproducible way with the proper dependencies
  configured. To run the tests in this way, run the following command from the

<span class="line-new-header">--- 188,34 ---</span>
  
  ```bash
  $ sh gradlew reproduce
  ```
  
<span class="line-added">+ If you prefer to use the Makefile wrapper you can also run:</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ ```bash</span>
<span class="line-added">+ $ make reproduce</span>
<span class="line-added">+ ```</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ ## Developing</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ There are no additional dependencies required for developing Skara if you can</span>
<span class="line-added">+ already build and test it (see above for instructions). The command-line tools</span>
<span class="line-added">+ and libraries supports all of GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows and can therefore be</span>
<span class="line-added">+ developed on any of those operating systems. The bots primarily support macOS</span>
<span class="line-added">+ and GNU/Linux and may require [Windows Subsystem for</span>
<span class="line-added">+ Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) on Windows.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ Please see the sections below for instructions on setting up a particular editor</span>
<span class="line-added">+ or IDE.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ ### Vim</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+ If you choose to use [Vim](https://vim.org) as your editor when working on Skara then you</span>
<span class="line-added">+ probably also want to utilize the Makefile wrapper. The Makefile wrapper enables</span>
<span class="line-added">+ to you to run `:make` and `:make tests` in Vim.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
