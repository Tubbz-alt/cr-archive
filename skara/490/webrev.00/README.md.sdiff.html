 41 ## Building
 42 
<span class="line-modified"> 43 [JDK 12](http://jdk.java.net/12/) or later and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 44 5.6.2 or later is required for building. To build the project on macOS or</span>
 45 GNU/Linux x64, just run the following command from the source tree root:
 46 
 47 ```bash
 48 $ sh gradlew
 49 ```
 50 
 51 To build the project on Windows x64, run the following command from the source tree root:
 52 
 53 ```bat
 54 &gt; gradlew
 55 ```
 56 
 57 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
<span class="line-modified"> 58 tree root.</span>


 59 
 60 ### Other operating systems and CPU architectures
 61 
 62 If you want to build on an operating system other than GNU/Linux, macOS or
 63 Windows _or_ if you want to build on a CPU architecture other than x64, then
<span class="line-modified"> 64 ensure that you have JDK 12 or later installed locally. You can then run the</span>
 65 following command from the source tree root:
 66 
 67 ```bash
 68 $ sh gradlew
 69 ```
 70 
 71 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 72 tree root.
 73 
 74 ### Offline builds
 75 
 76 If you don&#39;t want the build to automatically download any dependencies, then
 77 you must ensure that you have installed the following software locally:
 78 
<span class="line-modified"> 79 - JDK 12 or later</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 80 - Gradle 5.6.2 or later</span>
 81 
 82 To create a build then run the command:
 83 
 84 ```bash
 85 $ gradle offline
 86 ```
 87 
 88 _Please note_ that the above command does _not_ make use of `gradlew` to avoid
 89 downloading Gradle.
 90 
 91 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 92 tree root.
 93 
 94 ### Cross-linking
 95 
 96 It is also supported to cross-jlink jimages to GNU/Linux, macOS and/or Windows from
 97 any of the aforementioned operating systems. To build all applicable jimages
 98 (including the server-side tooling), run the following command from the
 99 source tree root:
100 
101 ```bash
102 sh gradlew images
103 ```
104 









105 ## Installing
106 






107 To install the Skara tools, include the `skara.gitconfig` Git configuration
108 file in your user-level Git configuration file. On macOS or
109 GNU/Linux:
110 
111 ```bash
112 $ git config --global include.path &quot;$PWD/skara.gitconfig&quot;
113 ```
114 
115 On Windows:
116 
117 ```bat
118 &gt; git config --global include.path &quot;%CD%/skara.gitconfig&quot;
119 ```
120 
121 To check that everything works as expected, run the command `git skara help`.
122 





















123 ## Testing
124 
<span class="line-modified">125 [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) 5.5.1 or later is required to run the unit</span>
126 tests. To run the tests, execute following command from the source tree root:
127 
128 ```bash
129 $ sh gradlew test
130 ```
131 
<span class="line-modified">132 The tests expect [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.19.1 or later and</span>
<span class="line-modified">133 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) 4.7.1 or later to be installed on</span>






134 your system.
135 
136 This repository also contains a Dockerfile, `test.dockerfile`, that allows
137 for running the tests in a reproducible way with the proper dependencies
138 configured. To run the tests in this way, run the following command from the
139 source tree root:
140 
141 ```bash
142 $ sh gradlew reproduce
143 ```

<span class="line-added">111 ### Makefile wrapper</span>
<span class="line-added">112 </span>
<span class="line-added">113 Skara also has a very thin Makefile wrapper for contributors who prefer to build</span>
<span class="line-added">114 using `make`. To build the jlinked image for the CLI tools using `make`, run:</span>
<span class="line-added">115 </span>
<span class="line-added">116 ```bash</span>
<span class="line-added">117 make</span>
<span class="line-added">118 ```</span>
<span class="line-added">119 </span>
120 ## Installing
121 
<span class="line-added">122 There are multiple way to install the Skara CLI tools. The easiest way is to</span>
<span class="line-added">123 just include `skara.gitconfig` in your global Git configuration file. You can also</span>
<span class="line-added">124 install the Skara tools on your `$PATH`.</span>
<span class="line-added">125 </span>
<span class="line-added">126 ### Including skara.gitconfig</span>
<span class="line-added">127 </span>
128 To install the Skara tools, include the `skara.gitconfig` Git configuration
129 file in your user-level Git configuration file. On macOS or
130 GNU/Linux:
131 
132 ```bash
133 $ git config --global include.path &quot;$PWD/skara.gitconfig&quot;
134 ```
135 
136 On Windows:
137 
138 ```bat
139 &gt; git config --global include.path &quot;%CD%/skara.gitconfig&quot;
140 ```
141 
142 To check that everything works as expected, run the command `git skara help`.
143 
<span class="line-added">144 ### Adding to PATH</span>
<span class="line-added">145 </span>
<span class="line-added">146 The Skara tools can also be added to `$PATH` on GNU/Linux and macOS and Git</span>
<span class="line-added">147 will pick them up. You can either just extend `$PATH` with the `build/bin`</span>
<span class="line-added">148 directory or you can copy the tools to a location already on `$PATH`. To extend</span>
<span class="line-added">149 `$PATH` with the `build/bin` directory, run:</span>
<span class="line-added">150 </span>
<span class="line-added">151 ```bash</span>
<span class="line-added">152 $ sh gradlew</span>
<span class="line-added">153 $ export PATH=&quot;$PWD/build/bin:$PATH&quot;</span>
<span class="line-added">154 ```</span>
<span class="line-added">155 </span>
<span class="line-added">156 To copy the tools to a location already on `$PATH`, run:</span>
<span class="line-added">157 </span>
<span class="line-added">158 ```bash</span>
<span class="line-added">159 $ make</span>
<span class="line-added">160 $ make install prefix=/path/to/install/location</span>
<span class="line-added">161 ```</span>
<span class="line-added">162 </span>
<span class="line-added">163 When running `make install` the default value of `prefix` is `$HOME/.local`.</span>
<span class="line-added">164 </span>
165 ## Testing
166 
<span class="line-modified">167 [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) 5.5.2 or later is required to run the unit</span>
168 tests. To run the tests, execute following command from the source tree root:
169 
170 ```bash
171 $ sh gradlew test
172 ```
173 
<span class="line-modified">174 If you prefer to use the Makefile wrapper you can also run:</span>
<span class="line-modified">175 </span>
<span class="line-added">176 ```bash</span>
<span class="line-added">177 $ make test</span>
<span class="line-added">178 ```</span>
<span class="line-added">179 </span>
<span class="line-added">180 The tests expect [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.19.3 or later and</span>
<span class="line-added">181 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) 4.7.2 or later to be installed on</span>
182 your system.
183 
184 This repository also contains a Dockerfile, `test.dockerfile`, that allows
185 for running the tests in a reproducible way with the proper dependencies
186 configured. To run the tests in this way, run the following command from the
187 source tree root:
188 
189 ```bash
190 $ sh gradlew reproduce
191 ```
192 
<span class="line-added">193 If you prefer to use the Makefile wrapper you can also run:</span>
<span class="line-added">194 </span>
<span class="line-added">195 ```bash</span>
<span class="line-added">196 $ make reproduce</span>
<span class="line-added">197 ```</span>
<span class="line-added">198 </span>
<span class="line-added">199 ## Developing</span>
<span class="line-added">200 </span>
<span class="line-added">201 There are no additional dependencies required for developing Skara if you can</span>
<span class="line-added">202 already build and test it (see above for instructions). The command-line tools</span>
<span class="line-added">203 and libraries supports all of GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows and can therefore be</span>
<span class="line-added">204 developed on any of those operating systems. The bots primarily support macOS</span>
<span class="line-added">205 and GNU/Linux and may require [Windows Subsystem for</span>
<span class="line-added">206 Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) on Windows.</span>
<span class="line-added">207 </span>
<span class="line-added">208 Please see the sections below for instructions on setting up a particular editor</span>
<span class="line-added">209 or IDE.</span>
<span class="line-added">210 </span>
<span class="line-added">211 ### Vim</span>
<span class="line-added">212 </span>
<span class="line-added">213 If you choose to use [Vim](https://vim.org) as your editor when working on Skara then you</span>
<span class="line-added">214 probably also want to utilize the Makefile wrapper. The Makefile wrapper enables</span>
<span class="line-added">215 to you to run `:make` and `:make tests` in Vim.</span>
<span class="line-added">216 </span>
