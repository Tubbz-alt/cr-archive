  1 # OpenJDK Project Skara
  2 
  3 The goal of Project Skara is to investigate alternative SCM and code review
  4 options for the OpenJDK source code, including options based upon Git rather than
  5 Mercurial, and including options hosted by third parties.
  6 
  7 This repository contains tooling for working with OpenJDK projects and
  8 their repositories. The following CLI tools are available as part of this
  9 repository:
 10 
 11 - git-jcheck - a backwards compatible Git port of [jcheck](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/)
 12 - git-webrev - a backwards compatible Git port of [webrev](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/webrev/)
 13 - git-defpath - a backwards compatible Git port of [defpath](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/defpath/)
 14 - git-fork - fork a project on an external Git source code hosting provider to your personal space and optionally clone it
 15 - git-sync - sync the personal fork of the project with the current state of the upstream repository
 16 - git-pr - interact with pull requests for a project on an external Git source code hosting provider
 17 - git-info - show OpenJDK information about commits, e.g. issue links, authors, contributors, etc.
 18 - git-token - interact with a Git credential manager for handling personal access tokens
 19 - git-translate - translate between [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/)
 20 and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) hashes
 21 - git-skara - learn about and update the Skara CLI tools
 22 - git-publish - publishes a local branch to a remote repository
 23 
 24 There are also CLI tools available for importing OpenJDK
 25 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) repositories into
 26 [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repositories and vice versa:
 27 
 28 - git-openjdk-import
 29 - git-verify-import
 30 - hg-openjdk-import
 31 
 32 The following server-side tools (so called &quot;bots&quot;) for interacting with
 33 external Git source code hosting providers are available:
 34 
 35 - hgbridge - continuously convert Mercurial repositories to git
 36 - mlbridge - bridge messages between mailing lists and pull requests
 37 - notify - send email notifications when repositories are updated
 38 - pr - add OpenJDK workflow support for pull requests
 39 - submit - example pull request test runner
 40 
 41 ## Building
 42 
 43 [JDK 12](http://jdk.java.net/12/) or later and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
 44 5.6.2 or later is required for building. To build the project on macOS or
 45 GNU/Linux x64, just run the following command from the source tree root:
 46 
 47 ```bash
 48 $ sh gradlew
 49 ```
 50 
 51 To build the project on Windows x64, run the following command from the source tree root:
 52 
 53 ```bat
 54 &gt; gradlew
 55 ```
 56 
 57 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 58 tree root.
 59 
 60 ### Other operating systems and CPU architectures
 61 
 62 If you want to build on an operating system other than GNU/Linux, macOS or
 63 Windows _or_ if you want to build on a CPU architecture other than x64, then
 64 ensure that you have JDK 12 or later installed locally. You can then run the
 65 following command from the source tree root:
 66 
 67 ```bash
 68 $ sh gradlew
 69 ```
 70 
 71 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 72 tree root.
 73 
 74 ### Offline builds
 75 
 76 If you don&#39;t want the build to automatically download any dependencies, then
 77 you must ensure that you have installed the following software locally:
 78 
 79 - JDK 12 or later
 80 - Gradle 5.6.2 or later
 81 
 82 To create a build then run the command:
 83 
 84 ```bash
 85 $ gradle offline
 86 ```
 87 
 88 _Please note_ that the above command does _not_ make use of `gradlew` to avoid
 89 downloading Gradle.
 90 
 91 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 92 tree root.
 93 
 94 ### Cross-linking
 95 
 96 It is also supported to cross-jlink jimages to GNU/Linux, macOS and/or Windows from
 97 any of the aforementioned operating systems. To build all applicable jimages
 98 (including the server-side tooling), run the following command from the
 99 source tree root:
100 
101 ```bash
102 sh gradlew images
103 ```
104 
105 ## Installing
106 
107 To install the Skara tools, include the `skara.gitconfig` Git configuration
108 file in your user-level Git configuration file. On macOS or
109 GNU/Linux:
110 
111 ```bash
112 $ git config --global include.path &quot;$PWD/skara.gitconfig&quot;
113 ```
114 
115 On Windows:
116 
117 ```bat
118 &gt; git config --global include.path &quot;%CD%/skara.gitconfig&quot;
119 ```
120 
121 To check that everything works as expected, run the command `git skara help`.
122 
123 ## Testing
124 
125 [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) 5.5.1 or later is required to run the unit
126 tests. To run the tests, execute following command from the source tree root:
127 
128 ```bash
129 $ sh gradlew test
130 ```
131 
132 The tests expect [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.19.1 or later and
133 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) 4.7.1 or later to be installed on
134 your system.
135 
136 This repository also contains a Dockerfile, `test.dockerfile`, that allows
137 for running the tests in a reproducible way with the proper dependencies
138 configured. To run the tests in this way, run the following command from the
139 source tree root:
140 
141 ```bash
142 $ sh gradlew reproduce
143 ```
