  1 # OpenJDK Project Skara
  2 
  3 The goal of Project Skara is to investigate alternative SCM and code review
  4 options for the OpenJDK source code, including options based upon Git rather than
  5 Mercurial, and including options hosted by third parties.
  6 
  7 This repository contains tooling for working with OpenJDK projects and
  8 their repositories. The following CLI tools are available as part of this
  9 repository:
 10 
 11 - git-jcheck - a backwards compatible Git port of [jcheck](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/)
 12 - git-webrev - a backwards compatible Git port of [webrev](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/webrev/)
 13 - git-defpath - a backwards compatible Git port of [defpath](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/defpath/)
 14 - git-fork - fork a project on an external Git source code hosting provider to your personal space and optionally clone it
 15 - git-pr - interact with pull requests for a project on an external Git source code hosting provider
 16 - git-info - show OpenJDK information about commits, e.g. issue links, authors, contributors, etc.
 17 - git-token - interact with a Git credential manager for handling personal access tokens
 18 - git-translate - translate between [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/)
 19 and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) hashes
 20 - git-skara - learn about and update the Skara CLI tools
 21 - git-publish - publishes a local branch to a remote repository
 22 
 23 There are also CLI tools available for importing OpenJDK
 24 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) repositories into
 25 [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repositories and vice versa:
 26 
 27 - git-openjdk-import
 28 - git-verify-import
 29 - hg-openjdk-import
 30 
 31 The following server-side tools (so called &quot;bots&quot;) for interacting with
 32 external Git source code hosting providers are available:
 33 
 34 - hgbridge - continuously convert Mercurial repositories to git
 35 - mlbridge - bridge messages between mailing lists and pull requests
 36 - notify - send email notifications when repositories are updated
 37 - pr - add OpenJDK workflow support for pull requests
 38 - submit - example pull request test runner

 40 ## Building
 41 
 42 [JDK 12](http://jdk.java.net/12/) or later and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
 43 5.6.2 or later is required for building. To build the project on macOS or
 44 GNU/Linux x64, just run the following command from the source tree root:
 45 
 46 ```bash
 47 $ sh gradlew
 48 ```
 49 
 50 To build the project on Windows x64, run the following command from the source tree root:
 51 
 52 ```bat
 53 &gt; gradlew
 54 ```
 55 
 56 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 57 tree root.
 58 
 59 ### Other operating systems and CPU architectures
 60 
 61 If you want to build on an operating system other than GNU/Linux, macOS or
 62 Windows _or_ if you want to build on a CPU architecture other than x64, then
 63 ensure that you have JDK 12 or later installed locally. You can then run the
 64 following command from the source tree root:
 65 
 66 ```bash
 67 $ sh gradlew
 68 ```
 69 
 70 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 71 tree root.
 72 
 73 ### Offline builds
 74 
 75 If you don&#39;t want the build to automatically download any dependencies, then
 76 you must ensure that you have installed the following software locally:
 77 
 78 - JDK 12 or later
 79 - Gradle 5.6.2 or later
 80 
 81 To create a build then run the command:
 82 
 83 ```bash
 84 $ gradle offline
 85 ```
 86 
 87 _Please note_ that the above command does _not_ make use of `gradlew` to avoid
 88 downloading Gradle.
 89 
 90 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 91 tree root.
 92 
 93 ### Cross-linking
 94 
 95 It is also supported to cross-jlink jimages to GNU/Linux, macOS and/or Windows from
 96 any of the aforementioned operating systems. To build all applicable jimages
 97 (including the server-side tooling), run the following command from the
 98 source tree root:
 99 
100 ```bash
101 sh gradlew images
102 ```
103 
104 ## Installing
105 
106 To install the Skara tools, include the `skara.gitconfig` Git configuration
107 file in your user-level Git configuration file. On macOS or
108 GNU/Linux:
109 
110 ```bash
111 $ git config --global include.path &quot;$PWD/skara.gitconfig&quot;
112 ```
113 
114 On Windows:
115 
116 ```bat
117 &gt; git config --global include.path &quot;%CD%/skara.gitconfig&quot;
118 ```
119 
120 To check that everything works as expected, run the command `git skara help`.
121 
122 ## Testing
123 
124 [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) 5.5.1 or later is required to run the unit
125 tests. To run the tests, execute following command from the source tree root:
126 
127 ```bash
128 $ sh gradlew test
129 ```
130 
131 The tests expect [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.19.1 or later and
132 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) 4.7.1 or later to be installed on
133 your system.
134 
135 This repository also contains a Dockerfile, `test.dockerfile`, that allows
136 for running the tests in a reproducible way with the proper dependencies
137 configured. To run the tests in this way, run the following command from the
138 source tree root:
139 
140 ```bash
141 $ sh gradlew reproduce
142 ```
