  1 # OpenJDK Project Skara
  2 
  3 The goal of Project Skara is to investigate alternative SCM and code review
  4 options for the OpenJDK source code, including options based upon Git rather than
  5 Mercurial, and including options hosted by third parties.
  6 
  7 This repository contains tooling for working with OpenJDK projects and
  8 their repositories. The following CLI tools are available as part of this
  9 repository:
 10 
 11 - git-jcheck - a backwards compatible Git port of [jcheck](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/)
 12 - git-webrev - a backwards compatible Git port of [webrev](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/webrev/)
 13 - git-defpath - a backwards compatible Git port of [defpath](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/defpath/)
 14 - git-fork - fork a project on an external Git source code hosting provider to your personal space and optionally clone it

 15 - git-pr - interact with pull requests for a project on an external Git source code hosting provider
 16 - git-info - show OpenJDK information about commits, e.g. issue links, authors, contributors, etc.
 17 - git-token - interact with a Git credential manager for handling personal access tokens
 18 - git-translate - translate between [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/)
 19 and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) hashes
 20 - git-skara - learn about and update the Skara CLI tools
 21 - git-publish - publishes a local branch to a remote repository
 22 
 23 There are also CLI tools available for importing OpenJDK
 24 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) repositories into
 25 [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repositories and vice versa:
 26 
 27 - git-openjdk-import
 28 - git-verify-import
 29 - hg-openjdk-import
 30 
 31 The following server-side tools (so called &quot;bots&quot;) for interacting with
 32 external Git source code hosting providers are available:
 33 
 34 - hgbridge - continuously convert Mercurial repositories to git
