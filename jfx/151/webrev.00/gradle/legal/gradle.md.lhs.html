 10    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
 11 
 12    1. Definitions.
 13 
 14       &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
 15       and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
 16 
 17       &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
 18       the copyright owner that is granting the License.
 19 
 20       &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
 21       other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
 22       control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
 23       &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
 24       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
 25       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
 26       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
 27 
 28       &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
 29       exercising permissions granted by this License.
 30 
 31       &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
 32       including but not limited to software source code, documentation
 33       source, and configuration files.
 34 
 35       &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
 36       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
 37       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
 38       and conversions to other media types.
 39 
 40       &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
 41       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 42       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 43       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 44 
 45       &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 46       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 47       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 48       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 49       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 50       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 51       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 52 
 53       &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
 54       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
 55       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 56       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
 57       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
 58       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
 59       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
 60       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
 61       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
 62       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
 63       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
 64       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
 65       designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;
 66 
 67       &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 68       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 69       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 70 
 71    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 72       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 73       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 74       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 75       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 76       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 77 
 78    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 79       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 80       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 81       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 82       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 83       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 84       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 85       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 86       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 87       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 88       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 89       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 90       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 91       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 92       as of the date such litigation is filed.
 93 
 94    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 95       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 96       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 97       meet the following conditions:
 98 
 99       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
100           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
101 
102       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
103           stating that You changed the files; and
104 
105       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
106           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
107           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
108           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
109           the Derivative Works; and
110 
111       (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
112           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
113           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
114           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
115           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
116           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
117           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
118           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
119           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
120           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
121           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
122           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
123           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
124           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
125           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
126           as modifying the License.
127 
128       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
129       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
130       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
131       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
132       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
133       the conditions stated in this License.
134 
135    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
136       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
137       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
138       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
139       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
140       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
141       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
142 
143    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
144       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
145       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
146       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
147 
148    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
149       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
150       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
151       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
152       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
153       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
154       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
155       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
156       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
157 
158    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
159       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
160       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
161       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
162       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
163       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
164       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
165       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
166       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
167       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
168       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
169 
170    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
171       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
172       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
173       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
174       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
175       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
176       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
177       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
178       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
179       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
180 
181    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
