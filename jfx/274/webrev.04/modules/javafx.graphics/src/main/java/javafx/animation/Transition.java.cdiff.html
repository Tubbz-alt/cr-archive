   * This class offers a simple framework to define animation. It provides all the
   * basic functionality defined in {@link Animation}. {@code Transition} requires
   * the implementation of a method {@link #interpolate(double)} which is the
   * called in each frame, while the {@code Transition} is running.
   * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified">!  * In addition an extending class needs to set the duration of a single cycle</span>
   * with {@link Animation#setCycleDuration(javafx.util.Duration)}. This duration
   * is usually set by the user via a duration property (as in
   * {@link FadeTransition#durationProperty() duration}) for example. But it can also be calculated
   * by the extending class as is done in {@link ParallelTransition} and
   * {@link FadeTransition}.
