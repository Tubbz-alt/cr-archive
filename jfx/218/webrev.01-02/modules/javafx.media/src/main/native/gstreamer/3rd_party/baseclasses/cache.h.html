10 /* This class implements a simple cache. A cache object is instantiated
11    with the number of items it is to hold. An item is a pointer to an
12    object derived from CBaseObject (helps reduce memory leaks). The cache
13    can then have objects added to it and removed from it. The cache size
14    is fixed at construction time and may therefore run out or be flooded.
15    If it runs out it returns a NULL pointer, if it fills up it also returns
16    a NULL pointer instead of a pointer to the object just inserted */
17 
18 /* Making these classes inherit from CBaseObject does nothing for their
19    functionality but it allows us to check there are no memory leaks */
20 
21 /* WARNING Be very careful when using this class, what it lets you do is
22    store and retrieve objects so that you can minimise object creation
23    which in turns improves efficiency. However the object you store is
24    exactly the same as the object you get back which means that it short
25    circuits the constructor initialisation phase. This means any class
26    variables the object has (eg pointers) are highly likely to be invalid.
27    Therefore ensure you reinitialise the object before using it again */
