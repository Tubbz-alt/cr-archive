 40 // This is a fully adaptive mutex that only requires 1 byte of storage. It has fast paths that are
 41 // competetive to a spinlock (uncontended locking is inlined and is just a CAS, microcontention is
 42 // handled by spinning and yielding), and a slow path that is competetive to std::mutex (if a lock
 43 // cannot be acquired in a short period of time, the thread is put to sleep until the lock is
 44 // available again). It uses less memory than a std::mutex. This lock guarantees eventual stochastic
 45 // fairness, even in programs that relock the lock immediately after unlocking it. Except when there
 46 // are collisions between this lock and other locks in the ParkingLot, this lock will guarantee that
 47 // at worst one call to unlock() per millisecond will do a direct hand-off to the thread that is at
 48 // the head of the queue. When there are collisions, each collision increases the fair unlock delay
 49 // by one millisecond in the worst case.
