15 To assert build quality:
16    on an Unixised setup:
17       run make tests
18    otherwise:
19        There is 3 standalone tools runtest.c runsuite.c testapi.c, which
20        should compile as part of the build or as any application would.
21        Launch them from this directory to get results, runtest checks 
22        the proper functionning of libxml2 main APIs while testapi does
23        a full coverage check. Report failures to the list.
