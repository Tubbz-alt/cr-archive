<span class="line-removed">- The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.</span>
<span class="line-removed">- To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading</span>
<span class="line-removed">- support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified</span>
<span class="line-removed">- to produce &quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;.  This technique does not use the LZW</span>
