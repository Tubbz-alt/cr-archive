 /* Multiply an INT32 variable by an INT32 constant to yield an INT32 result.

  * 16 bits wide, so that a 16x16->32 bit multiply can be used instead of a
  * full 32x32 multiply.  This provides a useful speedup on many machines.
  * Unfortunately there is no way to specify a 16x16->32 multiply portably
