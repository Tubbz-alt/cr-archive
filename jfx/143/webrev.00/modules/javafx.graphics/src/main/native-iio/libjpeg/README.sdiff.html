101 
102 In plain English:
103 
104 1. We don&#39;t promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
105    please let us know!)
106 2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don&#39;t have to pay us.
107 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
108    program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
109    you&#39;ve used the IJG code.
110 
111 In legalese:
112 
113 The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
114 with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
115 fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided &quot;AS IS&quot;, and you,
116 its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

119 All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
120 
121 Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
122 software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
123 conditions:
124 (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
125 README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
126 unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
127 must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
128 (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
129 documentation must state that &quot;this software is based in part on the work of
130 the Independent JPEG Group&quot;.
131 (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
132 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
133 NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
134 
135 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
136 not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
137 acknowledge us.
138 
139 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author&#39;s name or company name
140 in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
141 it.  This software may be referred to only as &quot;the Independent JPEG Group&#39;s
142 software&quot;.
143 
144 We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
145 commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
146 assumed by the product vendor.
147

149 The Unix configuration script &quot;configure&quot; was produced with GNU Autoconf.
150 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
151 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
152 ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
153 but is also freely distributable.

166 We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
167 understand the innards of the JPEG software.
168 
169 The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
170     Wallace, Gregory K.  &quot;The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard&quot;,
171     Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
172 (Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
173 applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don&#39;t have the CACM issue
174 handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace&#39;s article is
175 available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf.  The file (actually
176 a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
177 omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
178 and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,
179 and it may not be used for commercial purposes.
180

231 The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
232 ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme
233 found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.
234 IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
235 Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2
236 (Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from
237 http://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision
238 of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note&#39;s design.
239 Although IJG&#39;s own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
240 uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.
